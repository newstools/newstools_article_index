Five MPs have urged governors to keep off the affairs of the National Government Constituency Development Fund.Led by Eldama Ravine s Moses Lessonet, who chairs the National Assembly s select committee on the fund, the MPs said lives had been changed and there was development in the constituencies since the fund was launched.Mr Lessonet said the fund was constitutional. We are very positive about the future of the fund, with the impact being felt at the grassroots level, he said after leading committee members to inspect development projects in Kipipiri constituency on Friday. The fund, he said, was designed to support grassroots development projects and achieve equitable distribution of resources across the regions.He heaped praise on Kipipiri for its use of the cash, citing several water projects and an ultra-modern vocational training centre. We should not be arguing about the merits or demerits of the fund since the purpose of the cash, channelled through the two levels of government, is to foster development activities, said the MP.MPs and governors have been embroiled in wars over the control of the fund, with the county bosses seeking to be in charge.MPs have said the governors demands are selfish.Kipipiri MP Samuel Gichigi asked the governors not to meddle in the fund. Governors should remember that this is the same Parliament that is allocating them billions of shillings to fund their activities, said Mr Gichigi.The Kipipiri MP said he had used the fund to construct 12 secondary schools, with the transition rate from primary to secondary school increasing from 46 to 89 per cent, among other projects.Vihiga MP Yusuf Chanzu said the money was used to fund projects under the national government and not counties. But even if you visit almost all the counties, the most visible projects are those funded through the NGCDF kitty, he said, adding that they were not in competition with the county governments as each of them had a distinctive role.Other MPs present were Suna West s Joseph Ndiege and his Wajir West counterpart Abdikadir Ore. email print email print Cardinal Njue said it was the responsibility of every Kenyan to seek peaceful co-existence.A report by NTSA indicates that in the first half of 2016, 1,574 deaths were reported on Kenyan
