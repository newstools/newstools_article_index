Jubilee-allied MPs in western Kenya have announced plans for a massive campaign to popularise the new outfit in the region. The MPs, who have maintained a low profile in the region after their parties dissolved to join Jubilee Party, said the rallies will begin at the constituency level.MPs Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East), Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), David Were (Matungu) and Malulu Injendi (Malava) have in the past weeks been meeting supporters in their constituencies, unlike their characteristic high profile campaigns in churches and at other public functions.Mr Washiali told Nation on the phone Monday that they were back in their constituencies for major campaigns to galvanise support for the new party in the region.The MP said the decision to embrace Jubilee Party signalled the beginning of major realignments that will transform politics in the western region.
