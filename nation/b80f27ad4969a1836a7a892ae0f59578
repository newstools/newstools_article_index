The Orange Democratic Movement has lost in a bid to get Sh5 billion from the Political Parties Fund.The party went to court earlier in the week to protest a delay in being paid their 40 per cent share of Sh5.11 billion from the fund.But Lady Justice Roselyn Aburili on Friday directed them to give copies of the case documents to the Registrar of Political Parties before further directions are issued on October 25.However, the judge agreed to also certify the matter as urgent noting that issues raised are weighty hence arguable.Through lawyer Julie Soweto, ODM sued the National Treasury, its Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich and the Registrar of Political Parties claiming that only a little amount of the monies meant to be disbursed had been released.ODM claimed that it is entitled to receive its proportionate funding having met the criteria established in law.They accused the National Treasury of failing to give out funds equal to or not less than 0.3 per cent of the revenue collected by the national government. There is no basis on how the sued parties chose to distribute only 0.03 per cent or an amount less than the total amount stipulated by law, which is evident that that act was in bad faith, Ms Soweto said.Jubilee, The National Alliance and the United Republican Party have been listed as interested parties.In the case documents, the 2016 Government Budget Policy summary indicates that the total revenue collected by the national government between 2011 to 2016 is about Sh4, 960.5 billion yet only Sh1,341,318,009 has been released from treasury.For the same period, ODM has also only received Sh501,575,919 hence the rest remains as an outstanding balance.ODM, therefore, claims that they have been unable to undertake their core mandate and to utilize funds which it is entitled to by law, hence want the Registrar compelled to release the said monies. email print email print But his speech was interrupted by the mourners.
