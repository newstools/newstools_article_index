Kenya women s Under-23 volleyball team coach, Catherine Mabwi, has said the team is adequately prepared to tackle opponents from west and north Africa at the Africa Nations championship. Kenya could come up against Senegal, Egypt and Tunisia at the four-day continental event which kicks off at the Safaricom Indoor Arena in Nairobi on October 23. Rwanda and Botswana have also confirmed participation in the six-team competition, whose winner will represent Africa at the World Championship in Slovenia next year.North and west African teams have consistently posed a headache for Kenyan teams in volleyball. For instance, Egypt s senior women s team deniedKenya a chance to compete at the Olympics earlier this year, with Cameroon eventually grabbing the opportunity.Tunisian club Carthage also defeated Kenya Pipeline in the final of this year s Africa Club Championship held in Tunis in May. We are prepared forthem. We have trained for two months and worked on recovery and mentality because this isn t a small tournament, Mabwi, a former Kenyaninternational, said Thursday.Kenya Prisons attacker Yvonne Wavinya has also tipped Kenya to bag the continental title. Our main aim is to ensure the trophy remains home. In executing this, there will be no fear, we are confident and committed, Wavinya added.SQUADPauline Nafula (KCB), Doreen Marani (KCB), Yvonne Sinaida (Kenya Pipeline), Veronica Tanui (Kenya Pipeline), Damaris Kamaina (Nairobi Water),Ednah Mwombe (Kenya Pipeline), Sarah Were (Unattached), Celestine Nyongesa (Kenya Pipeline), Maureen Agwalas (Nairobi Water), Ann Lowem(Kenya Prisons), Yvonne Wavinya (Kenya Prisons), Shyrine Jepkemboi (Kenya Prisons), Beldine Akinyi (Kenya Pipeline), Faith Immodia (St Paul s University), Maureen Nanjala (Kenyatta University), Leah Akumu (Strathmore University)Technical bench: Catherine Mabwi (head coach), Josep Baraza (Assistant coach) Vinny Khayinga (Trainer). email print email print The PS stated that busaa was still regarded as an illicit brew.Only nominated MP Isaac Mwaura told the Fred Athuok-led team that he had defected because my
