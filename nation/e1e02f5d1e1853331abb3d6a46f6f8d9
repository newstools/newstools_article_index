Kenya Book Publishers Association (KBPA) has criticised government s decision to centralise textbooks procurement, saying it will adversely affect the book business.In a statement, KBPA chairman David Waweru said single sourcing of books would lead to return of monopolistic tendencies and closure of hundreds of bookshops.Mr Waweru said the government would also bear transport and warehousing costs of textbooks as well as staffing expenses blamed for collapse of a similar system that resulted in liberalisation of the textbook market.Instead, the association wants individual schools be allowed to retain the role where their orders will be placed with pre-qualified book suppliers who will then be paid directly by the Ministry of Education. We are opposed to existence of briefcase booksellers who promote sale of counterfeits denying us our revenue as well as public coffers. The local economy within the 47 counties will best be safeguarded when individual small players have a role to play in the book market, he said.The association said it would in turn receive orders from the ministry headquarters to supply select books to specific bookshops for supply to schools.
