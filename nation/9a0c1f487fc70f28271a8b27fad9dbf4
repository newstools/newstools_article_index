Winners of the just concluded Jenga Talanta Festival are a happy lot after they got the opportunity to hang out, dine and take selfies with President Uhuru Kenyatta.The musicians, who emerged winners in the music competition that has been going on for several months got the rare chance to dine and mingle with the president at State House. This is a great honour not just to me but to all youths especially from the slums and informal areas, said Francis Omondi from Embakasi South as tears rolled down his cheeks. Francis emerged the overall winner in the Jenga Talanta Music Awards whose finals were held at the Kenya National Theatre, Nairobi last week. He trounced 16 finalists drawn from different constituencies in Nairobi who reached the finals.Speaking to the elated youth, Kenyatta, said stakeholders should join hands to develop resources for economic development since the country is rich in talent. As we have seen in many countries, talent is more beneficial when exploited than white collar jobs, he said while encouraging the youngsters to live up to their dreams. email print email print Winners of the just concluded Jenga Talanta Festival are a happy lot after they got the opportunity to hang out, dine and take selfies with President Uhuru Kenyatta.
