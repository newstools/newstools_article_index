Three Nairobi traders have been charged with forging Kenya Revenue Authority excise duty stamps worth Sh822 million, which prosecutors say would have found their way into the market.Stephen Njenga Kimani, Rhoda Muthoni Mungai and Joseph Wambugu Muchemi were seized at Cool Wines and Spirit shop in Pipeline AA estate, Nairobi, on September 7 where more contraband, including alcohol, was found in their possession, prosecutors said.The prosecution now wants them denied bail on the grounds that the offence of forgery attracts a seven-year jail term while the other charges facing the suspects are punishable by fines of not less than Sh5 million or three years in prison or both if they are convicted. The incentive for the accused person to abscond trial is high, prosecutor Daniel Karuri said.The suspects also face multiple charges of counterfeiting trademarks contrary to section 381(a) as read with section 36 of the penal code.They have denied that on unknown dates and unknown place, they counterfeited 85,000 Napoleon Gold Brandy bottle caps valued at Sh20 million.Mr Njenga and Ms Muthoni are further accused of counterfeiting nine Legend Spirit bottle caps worth Sh 1,350.INTENT TO DEFRAUDA further charge of forgery stating that Mr Njenga and Ms Muthoni made 2,229 false adhesive KRA stamps valued at Sh452,487 with intent to defraud was read out to the suspects, of which they pleaded not guilty.The fifth count stated that on September 7 at Cool Wines and Spirit shop in Pipeline AA estate, Nairobi, they were found in possession of Obikwa Wine and Durban Ville without excise stamps contrary to the Excise Duty Act. Public order will be disturbed and undermined if the accused are released on bail, in light of the first charge we are looking at 5,400,000 KRA fake stamps which would have found their way into the market, the prosecutor said.He said that in order to preserve public order the suspects should remain in custody until the case is heard and determined.However, their lawyer objected to the prosecution s application for bond denial saying they claims were based on mere allegations and that the suspects are willing to abide by the bail terms the court may peg to their release.Milimani magistrate Grace Gandani will make a ruling on Friday. In the meantime, the suspects are held in police custody. email print email print Kenya is lobbying against the planned agreement between US and 12 Asian states for fear of losingPeres will be buried next to Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to
