President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday commissioned a Sh30 billion container terminal at Mombasa Port.President Kenyatta said ports are poised to play a more integral role in trade facilitation following the discovery of oil and gases in the country and in the region. Kenya itself discovered oil in Turkana and intends to export its first shipment in June 2017, President Kenyatta said, adding that his administration is in the process of improving oil-handling capacity in the port of Mombasa.The new container terminal can handle fourth generation vessels of 6,000 Twenty Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) capacity.He said completion of the project marks another milestone for the maritime sector. In truth, the import of this project cannot be gainsaid. International trade records show that over 90 per cent of the world s cargo is transported by sea. Ports are therefore critical to the economic growth of any country, President Kenyatta said.President Kenyatta, noted that the port plays an important role in the development of the country and it is a lifeline to the regional economies that depend on it for a significant number of their imports and exports. To give an example, the port s transit traffic to the East African region increased from 7.2 million tonnes in 2014 to 7.7 million tonnes in 2015 an 8.2 per cent growth, he said.BURUNDIPresident Kenyatta also disclosed that the Kipevu Oil Terminal in Mombasa County will be relocated to a more suitable location to allow for expansion.He said the multi-billion shilling project will involve the construction of an off-shore jetty near Dongo Kundu. Upon completion, the new terminal will have the capacity to berth four ships of up to 100,000 tons at once compared to the current maximum of one vessel of no more than 80,000 tons, at a time, he said.He said the project, together with the expansion of the pipeline capacity between Mombasa and Eldoret, will enhance efficiency in the oil sector and reduce costs both locally and in the region.He disclosed that his administration is actively engaged in plans to develop small ports along the coastline into commercially viable entities including Shimoni, Malindi and Kiunga. Each port of these ports has been earmarked for development either as a fishing port or a commercial port, he said.To further ease congestion, President Kenyatta said the construction of an alternative route from Mombasa Port to Burundi through Voi, Taita Taveta, Holili border, Singida-Kobero border and finally to Bujumbura, is ongoing.The corridor, which will cover about 1545 Kilometres, will reduce the distance from Mombasa to Bujumbura through the Northern Corridor by 358 Kilometres.The National Assembly has approved Ksh 27.3 billion from JICA for the construction of a second phase of the commissioned container terminal project set to begin soon.Deputy President William Ruto commended President Kenyatta for his commitment to the expansion and modernization of the port that has scaled up its efficiency.
