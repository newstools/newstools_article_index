Double World marathon champion Abel Kirui will use this Sunday's 10-mile race in Tilburg, The Netherlands, and the September 10 UAP Old Mutual Ndakaini Half Marathon as part of his preparations for October's Chicago Marathon.Kirui has been lying low since winning his second straight World title in Daegu in 2011.And like Kenya's other Kenyan world beaters in the 2011 IAAF World championships, Kirui is yet to receive his Sh1 million State reward.However, on Thursday, the patriotic Administration Police officer said he would not dwell on outstanding State rewards but focus on winning more accolades for the country.After a lean, post-Daegu spell, he now wants to win a major in Chicago in October.On Thursday, he wound up training with a one and a half-hour run ahead of his trip to Tilburg at night.He said the UAP Old Mutual Ndakaini Half Marathon shaped his international running career and that's why he wishes to return to Ndakaini on September 10."I was still an upcoming runner and when I saw Paul Tergat as the chief guest at Ndakaini in 2006, I wanted to shake his hand and I saw the only way I could do this was by winning the race, and so I targeted a top three finish," Kirui said in Eldoret on Wednesday."But I won the race and got to shake Tergat's hand. He was my inspiration,"The September 10 UAP Old Mutual Ndakaini Half Marathon continues a tradition that started in 2004 under the Ndakaini Dam Environment Conservation Association (NDEKA).That year, UAP Old Mutual partnered with NDEKA to plant trees around the dam and sponsor the first Ndakaini Half Marathon.The Ndakaini Dam is located at the Aberdares, some 70 kilometres from Nairobi in Gatanga, Murang a County."This race is a gateway to international races and it is at Ndakaini that upcoming athletes meet with the elite stars and get encouragement," Kirui added."After winning in Ndakaini in 2006, I didn't even go back to my traditional training venue at Kapsabet, but I got an invitation to travel to Germany for competition and training," said Kirui.Speaking recently while registering Kirui for the race, George Mboga, the UAP regional Manager, said they are expecting about 4,500 participants and targeting to partner with elite athletes from all over the country. We started registration early in the North Rift because this area is endowed with talent when it comes to athletics. Through this event, we aim at sensitizing local communities on importance of maintaining the dam, said Mboga.The race on September 10 will start at 8:00am with Friday being the deadline for registration of elite runners. email print email print The first batch of doctors will be promoted by October 7.
