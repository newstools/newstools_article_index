Uganda has reversed its decision to delay the signing of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union.Trade minister Amelia Kyambadde said the government had made up its mind and was ready to sign the deal irrespective of whether all regional countries are on board.On Thursday, Kenya and Rwanda Trade ministers signed the EPA pact in Brussels, Belgium, with the European Union, a deal the East African Community (EAC) Council of Ministers had recommended earlier this year.Kenya was desperate to have the agreement signed to safeguard unlimited duty-free access for its exports to Europe after Tanzania and Uganda said the deal first signed in October 2014 needed to be renegotiated following Britain s vote to leave the bloc.Speaking on the sidelines of the seventh Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives sector review annual conference in Kampala on Tuesday, Ms Kyambadde said, The EU is our major trading bloc and we are going ahead to sign the EPAs.

The EAC states are expected to sign the deal before this month ends.If the EPA is not signed and ratified by all EAC partner states by September 30, Kenya, as the bloc s only state that is not classified as a "least developed country", stands to lose its market to the EU, an outcome that would have a significant impact on its economy.The rest of the members have alternative access to EU as they are all classified as least developed countries.The Private Sector Foundation Uganda executive director Gideon Badagawa said Uganda s decision to sign the EPAs has been long overdue. EPAs will build our capacities as far as infrastructures are concerned, which is an important gain, Mr Badagawa said.Additional reporting from The EastAfricanteam. email print email print Kenya and Rwanda have signed Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union even as two of its EAC partners say the deal does not auger well for the region's economies.
