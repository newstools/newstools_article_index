Small scale farmers in Nyamira County who have been protesting over the low bonuses offered by the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) have finally ended the two-week tea picking boycott.The Nation has established that all tea buying centres served by Gianchore and Tombe tea factories which were closed by the angry farmers have been re-opened.However, some farmers who were not satisfied with the bonus payments for tea they delivered to the factories for the past one year have resorted to selling their crop to multinational companies.The companies are taking advantage of the disgruntled farmers and are paying them Sh17 per kg of green leaf.Unlike, KTDA, the companies pay the growers cash on delivery, a move poor farmers prefer as it helps them to meet their daily financial obligations. I have quit delivering my tea to our factory which is associated with KTDA because it is exploitative and they always stress on leaf quality (two leafs and a bud) unlike the multinational companies that accept any soft stock of tea, Mrs Jane Obondi said.PRIVATE COMPANIESShe said the multinational tea company she will deliver her leaf to had accepted to pay her Sh17 per kg and a bonus of Sh5.She said privately owned factories treat farmers with decorum unlike those associated with KTDA where buying centre clerks usually frustrate them if the leaf they deliver does not meet the required quality.Ironically, the factories these farmers are running away from belong to them, and KTDA is merely an agency which auctions their processed leaf on the international market.Two weeks ago, tea farmers from Nyameru, Etono, Ikurucha, Mabundu, Marindi, Sironga and Kenyorora buying centres took to the streets protesting what they termed as 'unauthorised deductions from their bonuses.DEMANDED REFUNDThey vowed not to take their green leaves to the factories until the money that had been deducted was refunded.According Mr Justus Motanya, their spokesman, they had been informed by an audit firm that they would be paid Sh29 per kilo of tea as bonus.But factory managers, he said, deducted Sh3 per kilo without their approval.However, tea bosses in Kisii and Nyamira Counties denied the claims.Regional KTDA Executive Willy Bii said the demonstrations had largely been instigated by erroneous messages spread by activists on the social media and urged farmers to ignore them.He said the agency, in collaboration with the police have since opened investigations into the source of the messages. We are collaborating with the intelligence service to ensure these elements are nabbed, Mr Bii said recently. He also refuted claims that factory directors have squandered money meant for the farmers. email print email print Area police boss Kingsford Nyaga told the Nation that the officers were acting on a tip-off from The stolen data may have included names, email addresses, birth dates, and scrambled passwords.
