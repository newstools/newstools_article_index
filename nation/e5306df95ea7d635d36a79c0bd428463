Kenya s Harambee Stars and the Democratic Republic of Congo s Leopards clash in an international friendly match at the Stade des Martys de la Pentecoste Stadium in Kinshasa from 6:30pm East Africa Time on Tuesday.Stars will be aiming to stretch their impressive unbeaten run of five matches.The Stanley Okumbi-coached side have enjoyed a rare good run of late, holding 2017 Afcon-bound Uganda Cranes to a barren draw some four weeks ago in Kampala before battling Zambia to a 1-1 draw away on September 4 in their dead rubber African Cup of Nations qualifier.These results were preceded by identical one-all draws at Kasarani to Tanzania and Sudan in international friendly encounters on May 29 and May 31 respectively.Okumbi will head into Tuesday s clash cautiously optimistic, the anticipated intimidating atmosphere notwithstanding.Statistically, the Leopards stand head and shoulders above Stars.They are ranked 51 by Fifa, 40 places above the Stars at 91. Besides that, DR Congo have been regular participants in the Afcon showpiece and playing them at their own backyard at the intimidating 80,000-seater Stade des Martys will make Okumbi s players have a feel of what it means to run out under intimidating conditions. They (Congo) are a good team and I think the match will offer us a good opportunity to benchmark ourselves. The game is important and it will also grant me an opportunity to asses some of the players , Okumbi, 35, said prior to the team s departure for Kinshasa on Monday.Gor Mahia goalie Boniface Oluoch should be the natural starter between the posts, but Ulinzi Stars custodian James Saruni, has also been justifiably included in the squad after impressive performances in the league and has a shout at getting the first pick. At the same time, Congo s coach Florent Ibenge has named in his team, Hull City forward Dieumerci Mbokani among a number of star players plying their trade in Europe s big leagues, including Cedric Bakambu of Spanish La Liga side Villarreal.The Stars midfield, likely to be marshalled by Anthony Teddy Akumu, will have to keep a close watch on Bope Bokadi who turns out for local giants TP Mazembe and Mpoku Paul-Jose of Panathiniakos. email print email print Interior minister Nkaissery did not deny that some police officers had been involved in criminal It is alleged that the two MCAs spent the entire weekend with the girls.
