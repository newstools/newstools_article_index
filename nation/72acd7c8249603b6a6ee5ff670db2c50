Diamond Platinumz is still riding high at the top of his game for his smooth-as-honey bongo-flavoured voice, his ability to shift between genres, and of course, his beautiful videos. This one, "Salome", featuring Rayvanny, is no exception. The song was "written by Diamond Platinumz &amp; Rayvanny in Tanzania, in 2016" and is taken from the original song "Maria Salome" by Saida Karoli. The song "Salome" is suggestive in its lyrics, if you listen closely enough, as most bongo hits are. Though the song is simple and beautiful in itself, and catchy, the video is what really catches your eye. Fans of Saida Karoli will appreciate the fusion of authenticity and urban culture in both the video and the lyrics. The video is shot in slightly oversaturated hues of bright yellows, reds, vivid blues and pinks, which makes the colours pop. It sets both artists shifting in many regal outfits from scene to scene, indicative of Nigerian royalty influences with the stunning agbadas and traditional beads. The switching of sceneries is a common feature in music videos, where there is nothing in the shot but a chair, or two giant vases, or royal bodyguards, standing over the crooners. There are two sets of dancers who look like they are having a really good time; a set of men, and a set of women. I would have loved to see more of these two groups in the video as well. The video was released on September 18, and to date, is nearing one million views, having passed 800,000 already.
