Harambee Starlets coach David Ouma feels more confident following the team s recent successes in international matches ahead of next month s Africa Women Cup of Nations.However, he admitted that there is a lot of anxiety before the African tourney.Starlets have risen from a low-lying, unrecognised and neglected team to fearsome side in just one year.But Ouma remains acutely aware that this impressive record could be blown out with a poor showing in the Awcon competition scheduled for Limbe, Cameroon. Starlets began their week-long camp in Morocco with an emphatic 8-1 victory over Wydad Casablanca.Speaking from Casablanca, Ouma said his main focus is to build confidence in the team. Working with the team has been remarkable. I would be happier if we performed well in Cameroon. That is for my greatest challenge. We ve had good preparation. The international games the girls played gave them much needed experience to face even the best on the continent. I recognise that the players recent success may cloud their judgement. Our team is at a disadvantage compared to others since they have never competed at that level. I want them to believe in themselves, he said. The national team was expected to play CAK Khenifra in another friendly match Monday evening as they wait for confirmation on whether or not they would play the Moroccan national team. This high-profile match was scheduled for last Saturday but was cancelled since some of the Moroccan national team players are military officers participating in Military Games. Starlets jet back on Thursday at 8.30am and head to camp prepare for another friendly against Cameroon on Saturday in Nairobi. email print email print President Kenyatta says his government has done more than previous administrations in fightingOlympic champions David Rudisha, Vivian Cheruiyot, Eliud Kipchoge and Conselsus Kipruto are among
