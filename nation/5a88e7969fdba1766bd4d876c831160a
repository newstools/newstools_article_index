Imenti South MP Kathuri Murungi has warned that a stormy nomination process could collapse the new Jubilee Party (JP).Mr Murungi said the party s leadership should make it clear to aspirants who intend to vie on the JP ticket how the process will work. We want structures of the Jubilee Party made clear right from the national level to the grassroots. We want clear rules of the game so that Kenyans have enough confidence in JP, Mr Murungi said.The MP spoke on Sunday at Nkubu Stadium during a fundraiser for the local Methodist Church of Kenya.There have been concerns over nominations in some Jubilee strongholds where aspirants have been warming up to JP, whose ticket is seen as a direct path to winning in the August 2017 General Election. The fight for the JP ticket has been fuelled by the new law that outlaws party-hopping.However, Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi assured aspirants that nominations will be free and fair. He said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will oversee the entire process.Mr Murungi announced there will be a meeting for aspirants from Meru on October 2 to clear the air about nominations. In this meeting we will discuss about the structures of the party. I want to say that Jubilee s nomination will be transparent and after the process, we will support the winners, Mr Murungi said. email print email print The suspect was accused of killing National Intelligence Service officer Hashim Salman in July War crimes judges Tuesday found a Malian jihadist guilty of destroying Timbuktu&#039;s fabled shrines,
