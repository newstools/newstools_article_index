Events organiser Kevin Ombajo, or Big Kev to many, is currently in India for a life saving operation in his head to deal with a brain tumour that has refused to respond to numerous surgeries and treatment.Big Kev s fight with the brain tumour has been going on for six years now and just when he believed he has won the fight, it reared its ugly head again.We are told he flew to India last week after complications developed on his right brain and a week in a top Kenyan hospital did not yield much, thus necessitating the flight to India.In July, he was hospitalised after a seizure after which he took to Facebook to share his six-year journey with the tumour and how much it has affected his life. The sickness robbed us of millions, time, resources and much more but never doubt the power of prayer and faith. It is a chapter I m determined to leave behind me for good. There is nowhere I have not gone in search of a cure and nothing I have not been prepared to. Interesting to note that over the last two months I have had *four* of these attacks; in class with my colleagues, with my driver, at home with the maid opening the door for me and most painfully a nasty fall in front of my young daughter and later having her witness daddy shaking on the ground. His family, friends and fans filled his Facebook timeline with heartfelt messages wishing him a quick recovery.Alego Akinyi wrote By His stripes Kev is healed. We plead the blood of Jesus over him. Quick recovery, while Evarita Kamau said Standing with you in prayer. May healing be his potion, email print email print Mr Menjo says this device can even be concealed from the driver in a PSV.
