The Meru Government is set to brand its own coffee to increase earnings from the cash crop.Mr Ntoitha M Mithiaru, the cooperative, trade and tourism executive said the county is one of the best producers of quality coffee in the world and developing a brand would earn farmers more income. Farmers came together in 2014 and formed Meru County Coffee Millers Union. Through the union they have been able to get better prices from sales. The lowest (amount) farmers have been paid is Sh60 per kilo and highest is Sh130, he said.He said the payment to the farmers depends on the international markets but will change with value addition.He said cartels were swindling farmers but they have now been sensitised through seminars organised by the county government.Challenges that farmers faced, including access to fertilizer and seedlings, have also been addressed. We have made it easier for farmers to get fertilizer by granting them loans as well as carrying out research on different types of soils in the county to identify the best seedlings for different areas, he said. email print email print The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has picked Court of Appeal Judge David Maraga for the post More officers have been deployed to the area to carry out air and ground surveillance.
