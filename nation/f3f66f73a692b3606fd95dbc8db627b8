A taskforce set up to look into problems facing the miraa trade says it is confident Kenya will regain the European market if farmers meet export conditions.Speaking at a meeting with Meru County Assembly members, taskforce chairman Mwenda Nchooro said the stimulant is restricted and not banned in Tanzania, the Netherlands and United Kingdom.He said the Netherlands and the UK set conditions that exporters had to meet before it is allowed in the market.
