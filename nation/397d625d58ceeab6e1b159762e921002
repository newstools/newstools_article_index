LONDONChelsea captain John Terry will be sidelined for 10 days after suffering an ankle ligament injury against Swansea on Sunday.Terry strained ligaments in his left ankle during the 2-2 Premier League draw and left the Liberty Stadium on crutches.The 35-year-old will miss Chelsea's Premier League clash against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Friday as well as next week's League Cup trip to Leicester.In a post on his Instagram account, Terry wrote: "I have strained my ligaments in my ankle which means I will be out for 10 days."Absolutely gutted, but will be giving everything to get back playing."Terry's diagnosis may not be as bad as was first feared but will still provide Chelsea boss Antonio Conte with a defensive headache ahead of the Liverpool game.Conte was unimpressed by some of Chelsea's defending at the Liberty Stadium, although Terry escaped culpability for either of the Swansea goals.Brazil centre-back David Luiz, who was on the bench at Swansea, is most likely to replace Terry for the clash with Jurgen Klopp's team."John Terry's injury suffered in Sunday's game at Swansea is strained ligaments in his foot. He will be out for approximately 10 days," a Chelsea statement read."Our captain was injured in the closing minutes of the 2-2 draw at the Liberty Stadium. He completed the game in pain and Antonio Conte confirmed afterwards the problem would need medical assessment." email print email print National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi forwarded the list of nominees on October 6.
