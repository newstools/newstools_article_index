Police officers could be some of the major tax defaulters in the country.This emerged during the seventh day of the traffic police vetting being conducted at Nakuru s Kunste Hotel.Revelations that some police officers made huge transactions amounting to millions of shillings through M-Pesa tills that led to avoidance of paying tax shocked the Johnstone Kavuludi-led National Police Service vetting team.M-Pesa tills hide the identity of people making deposits, hence making it easier for an individual to evade the paying the extra transaction fee charged when one transfers money from one number to another.Most of the officers vetted confessed that they made direct transactions to avoid paying the extra transaction fee. Part of the transaction fee is usually paid as tax to the government.On the spot was Narok-based officer constable Patrick Mulei s direct till deposits that amounted to Sh5.6 million in two years.Constable Mulei, who has been serving in traffic in the past 15 years claimed in his defence that the deposits were from his many businesses.Another officer from Salgaa traffic base Joshua Kemei could not explain to the vetting panel the individuals who made direct deposits to his account consistently on three M-Pesa agents while still serving at Ukunda between 2012 and 2013 as they did not reveal their identity.The direct deposits amounted to more than Sh2 million in only two years.When questioned by a panelist, he said he made the profits from his charcoal business and that he made the deposits himself.EVADING TAXES NPSC chairman Johnston Kavuludi noted that apart from using M-Pesa tills to conceal the identity of depositors, the officers were also committing an offence of evading taxes. It has become a trend especially with police officers who don t want their sources of money to be known. This also denies government the revenue as through proper transactions a portion of the money goes to tax, noted Mr Kavuludi.Some police officers vetted revealed they received money in forms of gifts from the members of the public.Other officers questioned for making direct M-Pesa deposits include Kerugoya-based Constable Elema Guyo, who recorded Sh1.3 million in two years and Constable Daniel Kipromet of Naivasha Highway Patrol Unit who was unable to account for Sh6 million deposits into his account. email print email print Ms Tutui said the court would have given orders for immediate realisation of the rule. But the passport was not stamped, meaning he did not pass through the immigration desk.
