Dahabshiil Money Transfer Limited is still operational and has not been de-registered by the Central Bank of Kenya, the regulator tweeted Friday afternoon.It was not immediately clear why the company had decided to withdraw the application for a banking license.The move could be linked to the recent controlled banking environment in the country that has seen lending rates capped at 14.5 per cent while the deposit rates have been fixed at 7.35 per cent. It also remains unclear whether the bank would have operated as an Islamic lender or a conventional one.
