A group of youth Monday pelted striking health workers from public hospitals in Meru County with stones outside the county headquarters in Meru Town.The nurses had marched there seeking audience with Governor Peter Munya over a grievance regarding their promotions.Police lobbed teargas canisters to disperse the youths, who were armed with stones and other weapons.The workers were led by Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) Meru Branch chairman Mugambi Bakari, secretary Nesbitt Mugendi and Association of Public Health Workers representative Samuel Michere.They were denied entry into the county offices and also Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital. We are yet to get our demands addressed, said Mr Bakari. Since we have been attacked by goons, we will stay at home until Monday next week. Efforts by County Secretary Julius Kimathi to convince the health workers to go back to work as they await the promotions were unsuccessful.Tigania East Member of Parliament Mpuru Aburi and his Tigania West counterpart David Karithi separately addressed the health workers before the gathering was disrupted by the youth.Some of the striking health workers outside the Meru County government offices where they unsuccessfully sought to have audience with Governor Peter Munya on October 10, 2016.
