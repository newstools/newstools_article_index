A team has been set up to investigate the whereabouts of assets worth Sh143 billion, which were supposed to be handed over to counties.Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri on Thursday said the committee - set up two weeks ago - would trace the assets that include land, furniture and vehicles that were owned by the former local authorities.Reports indicate that unscrupulous individuals, assisted by errant officials of former local authorities took advantage of a gap in law to steal most of the Sh143 billion assets.The property, which was to be audited and handed over to the 47 counties by the defunct Transition Authority whose three-year term ended in March, were instead shared out before and after the 2013 General Election as the government dragged its feet. As much as functions have been devolved, the question about transfer of assets and liabilities is yet to be answered. We have been grappling with this issue for four years, said Mr Kiunjuri when he visited the Lake Basin Development Authority to inspect the new mall in Kisumu town s Mamboleo neighbourhood.Mr Kiunjuri, however, said it was too early to determine whether the assets are lost or in place and that the committee will ascertain this.Meanwhile, governors could in future have to prepare a list of all assets and liabilities in their respective counties, at least 90 days to a General Election for scrutiny.This will avert any theft of public resources during the transition period, especially when governors are ousted.This has been proposed in the Assumption of the Office of Governor Bill (2016), crafted by Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi.Mr Wamatangi said a committee comprising representatives of county governments, county assemblies and the national government should be established and tasked with authenticating the lists to ensure all assets and bills are documented. email print email print Peres will be buried next to Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to Ms Tutui said the court would have given orders for immediate realisation of the rule.
