A few months ago I read the Caine Prize compilation of finalist short stories of 2013, which is where I first met Elnathan s riveting work, "Bayan Layi", a short story that was one of my favourites in the collection, about a street boy for hire thrown into the middle of a village election that turns awry.This story continues in Born on a Tuesday. He continues the story of this innocent boy and what happens after he leaves his home burning behind him and runs into the bush. Born on a Tuesday is a tale of a boy growing into a man; of a country going to the dogs; and a fictional account, that almost sounds real, about exactly how the flame of religious extremism is ignited.I loved this book! It was well told, well placed in today s world of Boko Haram, abductions, and fearful terrorist attacks, and very well paced. It took me an afternoon to finish, it was that good.And interspersed in there were a lot of revelations about life and love that did not take away from the overarching theme of the book; which was really just the human condition, and isn t that the best kind of novel?
