RABATMoroccans have gone to the polls to elect a new parliament, five years after an Islamist-led government took office following Arab Spring-inspired protests that toppled regimes across the region.The Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD) aims to fight off a liberal opposition which says it wants to roll back the Islamisation of the society.But the real power will remain in the hands of King Mohammed VI, the scion of a monarchy that has ruled the North African country for 350 years.Early turnout was low at polling stations in the capital but many people said they would wait until after the main weekly Muslim prayers at midday to go and cast their vote.PJD came to power in 2011, months after street protests prompted concessions from the monarchy.A new constitution transferred some of the king s powers to parliament, at a time when autocratic regimes were falling in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya.Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane s PJD heads a coalition including communists, liberals and conservatives.The party says a second term would allow it to press ahead with its economic and social reforms.While in government, it passed a controversial reform of the retirement system and followed a relatively liberal economic policy.Its task has been complicated by the unstable world economy and a drought this year that has hit Morocco s vital agriculture and sent growth plummeting.It has also been weakened by rising unemployment and what critics say is a failure to make good on promises in 2011 to tackle corruption.The party has also faced a string of scandals within its ranks including a drugs bust, a land-grab deal and the suspension of two vice presidents found in a sexual position on a beach.The PJD is, however, credited with lowering the budget deficit, and is popular in towns. It is weaker in rural areas, where a drought has ravaged the country s agriculture sector. email print email print All the mock examination papers bear the portrait of Governor Cornell Rasanga The said his country is trying to balance between opening up and controlling admission.
