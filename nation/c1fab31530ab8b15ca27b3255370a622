I was called by a student last night who informed me they were planning to strike. I don t think the strike [has anything to do with] the books, she said.She added: They refused to listen to me and said my deputy should go first and this might be the cause of the whole issue. I understand he has been taking stringent disciplinary measures against the students and this is what should be done.
