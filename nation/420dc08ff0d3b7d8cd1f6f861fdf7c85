Kenya have retained their Group Two status at the annual FIVB Grand Prix, following a decision by the international volleyball body to increase by two the number of national teams featuring in this elite women s competition.Initially, the national women s volleyball team had been relegated to the bottom tier Group Three League ahead of next year s competition.This was after the Malkia Strikers endured a tough run which saw them finish bottom of Group Three this season in a pool that had hosts Puerto Rico and Poland, plus the Dominican Republic, Bulgaria, Argentina, Czech Republic and Canada. But thanks to the FIVB decision arrived at in Zurich on Wednesday evening, Kenya, who won the Group Three League in Australia back in 2015, now have their Group Three status intact.Teams participating in this annual event are seeded in Groups 1 to 3, in relation to their strengths, rankings and recent results. According to the draw released this week, Malkia Strikers will compete against seasoned national sides such as Korea Republic, Kazakhstan, Czech Republic, Puerto Rico, Peru, Croatia, and Germany during the month long tournament that will be co-hosted by Germany and Croatia.In a related development, the World Grand Prix Council also confirmed that the winning teams across the three tiers of this event will share prize money totalling Sh60 million.Some 32 national teams, drawn from Europe, Asia, the Caribbean, South America ad Africa will compete in next year s event. Africa will be represented by Kenya, Algeria and Cameroon.With the presence of international stars such as captain Mercy Moim, Brackcides Agala, Jane Wacu, Everlyne Makuto, Triza Atuka, Noel Murambi and Janet Wanja, the Malkia Strikers have consistently triumphed in all African competitions, but consistently struggled to perform in most international events including the FIVB World Cup.
