A man who drove the taxi that lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and the driver had used on June 23 has been arrested.The suspect, according to investigations, took part in the entire planning and actual murder of Mr Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and their taxi driver Joseph Muiruri.He has, however, told the police that he was made to believe that the three people were dangerous criminals. The suspect, whose identity has not been revealed for security reasons, told the police that he only learnt from the media that the three were not criminals as he had been made to believe.He will be charged in court Thursday morning.The suspect was captured on camera driving the Toyota Fielder, registration number KBX 126C, from Mavoko to Limuru. Police security camera footage showed the suspect driving the car on Mombasa Road from Mlolongo to the city. The last image of the car was captured near City Cabanas restaurant, at around 1:45pm.It is not clear why the vehicle disappeared from the multiple cameras covering the rest of the city and its environs.From City Cabanas, police relied on the Fielder s tracking device, which shows that the vehicle joined Lang ata Road, then used the bypass to Kikuyu before proceeding in the direction of Limuru.He is seen alone in the car, but the camera captured him only up to his chin, with the rest of his face hidden.The suspect abandoned the car in Limuru and travelled back to Syokimau in the evening. The suspect, in his statement, said that he, along with the four officers already charged in court and another suspect yet to be arrested, argued for almost three hours on whether to just torture or kill the three.He also told detectives that the other suspect is an Administration Police officer.Police have called the arrest a major breakthrough, saying the suspect is "very critical to the case." email print email print Kenya is lobbying against the planned agreement between US and 12 Asian states for fear of losingPeres will be buried next to Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to
