Starring Kevin Hart, Louis C. K., Jenny Slate, Eric StonestreetTurns out I don t like Louis C. K. s comedy. But his voice acting is entertaining to say in the least. The Secret Life of Pets was a funny, laugh out loud movie, about what happens in your house when you leave your pets at home ranging from rescue missions to all-day raves, if the movie is anything to go by. Max and Duke are two dogs who are forced to live together by their owner.Prompted by roommate aggression, trying to get rid of each other turns into a catastrophe that everyone has to pitch in to solve. Kevin Hart likely stole the show, and this is arguably his better movie this year (you guys know I slept through Central Intelligence).Jenny Slate, who you know from Obvious Child, House of Lies and the voice of Bellwether in Zootopia, puts in a sparkling performance as a hyper, almost excessively kind next door neighbour dog, and is hilarious the whole time. Watch it for a good laugh. email print email print The AfDB and the national government are funding this Sh6.1 billion project.The Interior Cabinet secretary said politicians who stormed the campus should either apologise or
