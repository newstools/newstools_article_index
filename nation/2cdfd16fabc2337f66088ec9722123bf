Jack Wilshere's fall from grace shows no sign of slowing as the Arsenal midfielder made a shock move to Bournemouth on a season-long loan on Wednesday.Wilshere was once regarded as one of the most promising youngsters in the Premier League, but Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has allowed the 24-year-old to leave the Emirates Stadium in a bid to revitalise his career.Wilshere has been hampered by a series of injuries and unsavoury off-field incidents in recent seasons and was left out of Sam Allardyce's first England squad this week.He has been limited to two substitute appearances this term after dropping behind Granit Xhaka, Mohamed Elneny, Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in Arsenal's central midfield pecking order.Wilshere last played 90 minutes in a Premier League fixture in September 2014, and had drawn interest from Crystal Palace, Roma and AC Milan after mutually agreeing with Wenger that he would benefit from playing regular first-team football.But Bournemouth won the race for his signature after reportedly agreeing to pay a 2 million (2.35 million euros, $2.6 million) loan fee and all of Wilshere's 80,000-per-week wages.The presence of Bournemouth striker Benik Afobe, a former Arsenal team-mate and godfather to Wilshere's child, may also have helped persuade him to move to the south-coast.It was during a loan move to Bolton in 2010 that Wilshere established himself as a player of exceptional promise and after which he featured regularly for Arsenal and England.He will now hope a spell under Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe can produce similar results."Jack is a fantastic addition to the club," Bournemouth chief executive Neill Blake said after Wilshere was pictured holding up the club's red and black striped shirt outside their Dean Court stadium. "He is a player that needs no introduction and one that, quite rightly, our supporters will be excited to see in a Bournemouth shirt."He will bring a wealth of international and Premier League experience, so we are delighted to be able to welcome a player of his calibre to the club." email print email print Ms Tutui said the court would have given orders for immediate realisation of the rule. But the passport was not stamped, meaning he did not pass through the immigration desk.
