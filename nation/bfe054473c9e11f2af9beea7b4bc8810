National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said that a provision in the electoral reform Bill barring party-hopping is constitutional but has left the door open for MPs to propose changes to it later on Thursday.Mr Muturi based his ruling on the standing orders, which were also referred to by his deputy Joyce Laboso when she ruled on the matter last week. Members of the House are at liberty to propose amendments to and indeed to amend the Bill in the usual manner as provided for under the standing orders. That settles the issue, said Mr Muturi.MPs had already gone ahead and prepared amendments to the 2016 Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, with Mr Muturi saying that many more are still being prepared in the course of the afternoon.The Speaker then ruled in favour of the Bill, which MPs opposed to the restriction on party-hopping had suggested contains limits on the freedom of association and the rights to form and join political parties.Mr Muturi said that a clear reading of Article 38 of the Constitution shows that the political rights are not absolute and would be subject to reasonable restrictions.BILL'S LAST STAGE The Constitution empowered Parliament to legislate on the regulation of the enjoyment of political rights, including prescribing any reasonable restrictions, he added.He pointed out as an example the provisions of the Constitution requiring that candidates going into elections as independent candidates should not have been members of a political party at least three months to an election.The Speaker said that as it is, the Elections Act requires political parties and candidates to submit documents to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) within given timelines.The Act requires parties to conduct primaries at least 45 days before the General Election, submit their membership lists to the IEBC at least 45 days to a General Election, and submit their nomination rules at least 90 days before the General Election. It is therefore evident that the timelines contained in the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill are not new or unusual. I must note that, in addition, I have scrutinized the Bill and I do not find any provision that may be interpreted as violating the fundamental rights and freedoms afforded under the Constitution, including the freedom of association and political rights, said Mr Muturi.The Bill will be taken through the last stage this evening. email print email print The Cord leader said the country has a lot to gain from changes proposed in the Bill.Interior minister Nkaissery did not deny that some police officers had been involved in criminal It is alleged that the two MCAs spent the entire weekend with the girls.
