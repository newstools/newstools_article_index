This is a clear demonstration of the university s commitment towards promoting sports education," said Wainaina.The conference called on African governments to increase investments into local sporting infrastructure as a way of promoting local talent, social cohesion and general well-being of their population.Embattled National Olympics Committee of Kenya president Kipchoge Keino called on the government to ensure that schools have playgrounds as a way of nurturing young talent."I started running in primary school, I never had the opportunities available today but I later won at the Olympics. If we ensure that schools have play grounds, children will nurture their talent early enough which shall in return improve our performance at international events," said Kipchoge. email print email print The group has also continued to carry out deadly attacks on targets across the border in Kenya.
