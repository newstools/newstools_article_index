Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo on Thursday maintained that Sh88 billion was deposited in the Consolidated Fund from the Eurobond account in June 2014.In a statement, Ms Odhiambo said the amount was included in the opening balance of Sh140 billion for the subsequent financial year 2014/15. I re-confirm that $999,018,457.60 (Sh88,463,084,420.45) was transferred into the Consolidated Fund in tranches from the Sovereign Bond Proceeds Account at the Central Bank of Kenya, she said. The amount was received in June 2014 and is, therefore, recognised as part of the opening balance of Sh140.67 billion of the 2014/15 financial year annual national budget implementation review report by the controller of budget issued in August 2015. She said net proceeds from tap sale amounting to Sh73 billion was also accounted for in the 2014/15 financial year. The tap sale of Sh73.81 billion is recognised as revenue in 2014/15 since this amount was received during this accounting period, Ms Odhiambo said. Therefore, Sh88 billion and Sh73 billion are reflected in the annual budget implementation review report released in August 2015.
