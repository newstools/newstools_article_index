AMREF Flying Doctors has appealed to county governments to set up an emergency fund that can be redeemed during medical evacuations and national disasters.The costs to airlift critically ill and injured patients common in far flung regions where Intensive Care services and other specialized procedures are non-existent are costly and are shouldered by the Emergency Service Providers. The costs for such medical evacuations for one patient, for instance from Mandera County can cost about Sh1 million. Already, AMREF Flying Doctors spends between Sh15 million to Sh20 million annually for such evacuations.According to AMREF Flying Doctors CEO and Medical Director Bettina Vadera, when called for medical emergencies in counties such as Samburu, Marsabit, Wajir and Garissa for instance it is difficult to say no. When there are medical emergencies that put lives of people at risk, we cannot refuse to get involved. If we don t go, we may lose the patient, because inside our aircraft we can already improve the patient s situation and save their lives, Dr Vadera added.She says, however, they are left with the financial burden after the patient has been referred to a facility that s better equipped.While she said talks were underway with the Ministry of Health on their concerns, they would also like the county governments to step in and support them.She added: We are appealing for greater support from both the Central government and the County governments in dealing with emergency evacuations. Last year alone we had 38 charity medical evacuations including the Garissa University attack in April. One notable medical evacuation was in January this year when a woman from Wajir, who was stabbed in the cheek in a domestic squabble by her husband, was transferred to Nairobi to have the knife removed. email print email print Kenya is lobbying against the planned agreement between US and 12 Asian states for fear of losingPeres will be buried next to Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to
