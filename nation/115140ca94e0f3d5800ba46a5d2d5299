IN JINJA, UGANDAThe national women s football team on Tuesday stormed into the semi-finals of the ongoing Cecafa Women Championship with a 4-0 rout of Burundi in Jinja.The match, billed as one of the toughest tests for the Starlets in the competition, turned out to be another walk in the park for David Ouma s charges.The 4-0 win, which came two days after the Kenyan girls humiliated hosts Uganda in their opening match by the same scoreline, ensured Starlets keep their 100 percent record and also qualify for the semi-finals.Neddy Atieno bagged a brace while star striker Esse Akida and captain Mary Kinutha were also on target as Starlets drubbed the Burundians, who thrashed Zanzibar 10-1 in their opening game on Sunday. "We are still on course. Getting out of the group was our target now we need to try and make the final," Kenya coach David Ouma told Daily Nation Sport in Jinja on Tuesday."I just told my players to play their game, everyone should play their role and that's what they did. Burundi s style of play was only going to be stopped by our fast passing and we beat them with our pace."Kenya would have gotten the lead just three minutes into the match but Atieno failed to make contact with Esse Akida's cross from the right even though Burundi's goalkeeper Belinda Ndoraraha was beaten.Four minutes later, Kinuthia's free-kick was stopped by Ndoraraha again before Vivian Akinyi had to rescue Kenya with a smart save off Aziza Misigiyimana's boot with the Starlets backline beaten.Akida then had her effort disallowed for offside before Carolyne Omondi hit the woodwork in a game that was wide open from the onset.At the half hour mark, Kenya found a breakthrough through Atieno who took advantage of Burundi's clumsiness while defending a corner.Three minutes later, Kinuthia doubled Kenya's lead after capitalising on the gaps in Burundi's defence to slot home from 20 yards.Akida put the score beyond doubt at the stroke of half-time after beating Burundi s off-side trap to give Starlets a 3-0 lead at the break.The Kenyans were not done yet with Atieno needing just 10 seconds to get her second of the game, her third of the tournament and Kenya's fourth of the afternoon after the restart.At the hour mark, coach David Ouma made all three substitutions at once with Atieno, Akida and Omondi all coming off for Vivian Corazon, Christine Nafula and Jacky Ogol respectively.The afternoon drizzle with ten minutes to full-time slowed the game down but it didn't dampen the spirit of the high-flying Kenyan girls."We struggled a lot to match them. Once they stopped us from playing our game, I knew we were in trouble," said Burundi's coach Danieall Niyibimenya after the game. Kenya's last group game is set for Thursday against the tournament s whooping girls Zanzibar while Uganda will play Burundi to complete Group A matches.SQUADSBurundi Starting XI: Belida Ndorarho (G.K &amp; Captain), Aziza Misigyimana, Bukuru Joe lle, Drone Irandkuda, Nasna Nahimana, Gilette Kanyamuneza, Neilla Uwineza, Souzane Zilfa, Asha Jafari Subs: Saidatte Nkuruzizia (G.K), Nancy Kamugisha, Divine Nihorimbere, Irakoze Oniane, Notia Saidatte, Neema Nshimirimana, Charlotte IradukundaHead coach: Daniella NiyibimenyaKenya Starting XI: Vivian Akinyi (G.K), Ann Alouch Onyango, Wendy Ann Achieng Asol, Oguttu Irene Awuor, Nixon Dorcas Shikobe, Carolyne Anyango Omondi, Esse Akida Mbeyu, Cheris Avilia Salano, Nedy Okoth Atieno, Dorren Nabwire Omondi, Mary Kinuthia Wanjiku Subs: Samantha Akinyi (G.K), Tereza Ouko Calleb, Jacky Ogol, Mercy Achieng Onyango, Christine Nafula, Elizabeth Ambogo Mwikal, Vivian Corazon Odhiambo email print email print National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi forwarded the list of nominees on October 6.
