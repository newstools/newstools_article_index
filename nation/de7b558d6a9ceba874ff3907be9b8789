A field of 144 golfers will converge on the par-72 Machakos Golf Club course Saturday from as early as 6am for the last leg of this year s Kenya Forest Service (KFS) golf series.Although the entry is more than what a nine-hole course can handle, club captain Munyao Kamba says every player will play and finish on time as long as players follow the draw. We have handled bigger entries before. It s just a matter of managing the players well, said Kamba. Besides the hosting club, entries were received from Thika, Railway, Golf Park, Ruiru, Kiambu and Kenya Air Force Eastleigh. Over the last five or so years, KFS has staged a series of golf events countrywide to sensitise golfers on the importance of tree planting and conservation. This year, the series visited Naivasha, Njoro, Thika, Kenya Air Force Eastleigh and Karen where over a 1,000 golfers competed. Like in the other events, over a number of prizes will be at stake today for club members, guests and of KFS. During the Thika Motor Dealers-sponsored tournament last month, David Muasya carded 41 points to beat James Ndunda on countback for the overall title. Jackson Nzioki carded 40 points to finish third. Ndunda and Nzioki are drawn along with others like former captain Larry Wambua who featured in last weekend s Diani Beach Masters at the South Coast s Leisure Lodge Golf Resort. email print email print Mr Odinga said the government had indirectly allowed corruption to thrive.The show was meant to promote urithi.go.ke, a website where rare photos of the country s history
