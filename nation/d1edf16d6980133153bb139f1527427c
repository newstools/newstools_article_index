Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) has developed new a kit for testing Rift Valley FeverResearchers said the new kit called ImmunoLine, is more efficient, less costly and the first of its kind to be developed in Africa.They said the kit, displayed during the ongoing Agricultural Society of Kenya (ASK) show in Mombasa, will enable early detection of the disease commonly found in northeastern Kenya.Kemri head of Production Department James Kimotho said they have tested more than 200 samples and the kit proved to be effective. This kit, which we have developed in collaboration with our Japanese partners, will support the early detection and early containment of Rift Valley Fever outbreak before it spreads and save lives in Kenya and beyond, said Dr Kimotho in an interview with the Nation.He noted that the current test for the disease takes a longer time to conclude as samples have to be taken to Kemri. They are costly at Sh25, 000 for 96 tests and they are not locally available, he added.The new kit displays results within five minutes.Dr Kimotho said they are in the final stage of testing the kit on large scale and it will be available in the next six months.Kemri Senior Marketing officer Doris Night said the kit shows two stripes for a positive test of Rift Valley Fever and one stripe for a negative result. email print email print Ms Tutui said the court would have given orders for immediate realisation of the rule.
