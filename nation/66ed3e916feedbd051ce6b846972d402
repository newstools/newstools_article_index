Dennis Kimetto s men s world record is once again under threat on Sunday as the BMW Berlin Marathon lines up, among others, two of the top three fastest runners of our generation.The 26.38 mile Berlin course has had the most men s and women s marathon world records broken, with a relatively flat surface, mild autumn temperatures and lively spectators attributed to the superb performances recorded almost every year. Seven men s world records have been set since 1998, four of them by Kenyan marathoners. And Kimetto s two-year-old world record of 2hours, 02:57sec could fall as the world s fastest marathon course lines up two Kenyans with sub 2:04 and four others with 2:06 and faster times. Former World Marathon record holder Wilson Kipsang, who reluctantly saw his 2:03:23 mark lowered to 2:02:57 by training mate Kimetto, leads the fearsome line up.Kipsang, however, has to be keen on the opposition that Emmanuel Mutai can pose. The soft-spoken Mutai is the fastest in the pile, having inked 2:03:03 in Berlin in 2014 when he finished second to Kimetto.Mutai, 30, appeared reluctant to openly state his commitment on the record. It is too early to say a thing about the record since I do not even know how the conditions are in Berlin, said Mutai, the third fastest marathoner in all-time list. Should the weather be favourable, I will try to improve my personal best, Mutai said, adding that finishing second in 2014 when the record was set motivates him to do better.When Kimetto set the current standing record in Berlin in 2014, Kipsang s reaction was that he will someday get it back. Speaking in Eldoret on Wednesday as he packed for Berlin, Kipsang said he was going for the record. I am back to the form I was when I set the record on the same Berlin course in 2013, Kipsang said. If the weather becomes favourable and pacemakers push well, I will set another record. Kipsang, the London Marathon course record holder, who is an elder back at his AIC Mindililwo Church in Iten, hopes God gives him another gift (record) this time.Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele, the world record holder in the 5000m and 10,000m, is widely regarded as one of the best distance runners of all-time. Bekele, who set 2:05:04 Paris Marathon course record while debuting over the 42km distance, is among men s formidable start list.Eliud Kipchoge, who is arguably the most dominant marathoner right now- boasting seven wins in eight marathons since 2013 - was out to break Kimetto s record in Berlin last year but the attempt was thwarted by shoes problem.ETHIOPIANS FAVOURITES IN WOMEN RACEKipchoge, the Olympic marathon champion, however, managed to improve his best to 2:04.00.In the women s race, two-time race s winner Aberu Kebede faces Tokyo Marathon champion Birhane Dibaba.Kebede has 2:20:30 personal best against her compatriot Dibaba, who debuts in Berlin Marathon with 2:22:30 as her PB. Kebede was second to Kenya s Gladys Cherono last year.Kenya s Janet Rono is also in mix. She has a personal best of 2:26:03 from 2014.ELITE FIELDMen: Emmanuel Mutai (KEN, 2:03:13),Wilson Kipsang (KEN, 2:03:23), Tsegaye Mekonnen (ETH, 2:04:32),Kenenisa Bekele (ETH, 2:05:04), Vincent Kipruto (KEN, 2:05:13), Sisay Lemma (KEN, 2:05:16), Eliud Kiptanui (KEN, 2:05:21), Evans Chebet (KEN, 2:05:33), Mark Kiptoo (KEN, 2:06:00), Alfers Lagat (KEN, 2:06:58), Yuki Kawauchi (JPN, 2:08:14).Women: Aberu Kebede (ETH, 2:20:30), Amane Beriso (ETH, 2:20:48), Birhane Dibaba (ETH, 2:22:30), Reina Iwade (JPN, 2:24:38), Ruti Aga (ETH, 2:25:27). email print email print Wilson Kipsang flies out to Berlin with his sights firmly trained on reclaiming the world record.
