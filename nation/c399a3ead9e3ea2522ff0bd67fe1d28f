The Harambee Starlets are keenly waiting to know their group opponents when the Africa Women Cup of Nations draw is done on Sunday.The draw for the biennial football competition, which will be held between November 19 and December 3 this year, will be conducted at Palais Ployvalent des Sports in Yaound .The free-scoring Starlets are in the mix with Africa s current best women s teams in the name of Cameroon, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, Mali and Zimbabwe.The teams will be divided into two groups of four.Kenya qualified for this competition following a 2-2 away goals victory over Algeria in a two-legged encounter.The Starlets have hugely impressed in the ongoing Cecafa Women Championship in Jinja, scoring 19 goals and conceding none in their opening three group matches against hosts Uganda, Burundi and Zanzibar to storm into the semi-finals.However, most of the players within the team s set up know too well that playing at their inaugural Nations Cup will be a different ball game altogether. All the teams there have been at this stage before, captain Mary Kinuthia told Saturday Nation Sport. We shall be playing there for the first time so being new at this stage, we are the underdogs whichever pool we find ourselves in. Striker Esse Akida, the leading scorer at the Cecafa tournament with five goals this far added: They are all tough teams, there is no question about that, but we started preparations early and after Cecafa we shall continue to prepare for the tournament, so we shall be ready. In Jinja, Kenya will play Ethiopia in the semi-finals of the Cecafa tournament on Sunday. Tanzania finished top in Group B and will now face hosts Uganda in the other last four encounter.Ethiopia and Uganda drew 0-0 in their final group match last evening, a result that left the two tied on points, goals scored and goals conceded.This forced the tournament organisers to employ the toss of a coin to determine which team finished first and second in Group B. Right now any team is strong enough to shock the other, we are ready for the challenge, it s a game we shall take seriously like any other because we want to make the final and from there try to win the championship, striker Neddy Atieno said. email print email print The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has picked Court of Appeal Judge David Maraga for the postDuring the vetting by the Judicial Service Commission, Justice David Maraga portrayed himself as
