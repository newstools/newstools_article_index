A lawyer was charged Friday with attempted murder in a Maua court. Peter Kirimi Mbogo was released on Sh300,000 bond pending the mention of his case on October 27. Mr Mbogo is accused of attempting to kill Silas Mwithalie on February 29 in Nkandone, Igembe North, where the complainant sustained panga injuries. The lawyer denied the charges. Kenneth Muriuki, the lead lawyer for Mr Mbogo, asked the court to grant his client a free bond considering he was an officer of Maua Law Courts. My client is a practicing lawyer with more than 20 years of practice and has always been in this court. He cannot escape, he said. In addition, Mr Muriuki said his client was informed of the case while he was in Wajir and made an effort to travel to Maua to appear in court. The defence counsel also asked to be supplied with the police investigations diary, all witness statements and other documents that the prosecution will use in the case. Maua Senior Principal Magistrate Samuel Soita directed the prosecution side to supply the defence with all the documents they might require. Meanwhile, five men were charged on Wednesday in the same court with attempting to kill the same complainant. Elias Njeru, Peter Muturia, Charles Kaburu, Dennis Gitari and Kennedy Mwiti denied the charges and were released on a Sh200,000 bond each with a surety of a similar amount. Mr Muriuki pleaded with the court to mention both cases on October 27 with a view to merging them and possibly scheduling a common hearing date. email print email print Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka has described MSF&#039;s findings as &#034;self-serving.&#034;The Northern Collector Tunnel builder has dismissed claims that the project will harm the
