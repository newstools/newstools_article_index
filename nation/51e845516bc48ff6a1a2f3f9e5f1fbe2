IN KAMPALAThe Federation of Uganda Football Associations (Fufa) on Thursday confirmed they owe Milutin Micho Sredojevic salary arrears after the Uganda Cranes coach reportedly filed a case at the Fifa dispute resolution chamber in Zurich. Micho led Uganda to the first Africa Cup of Nations finals since 1978 thanks to Farouk Miya s lone strike in the 1-0 victory over Comoros last Sunday. Fufa indeed owes Milutin Sredojevic unpaid salaries and shares his frustrations over the delay, Fufa said in a statement. During the costly Afcon 2017 qualification campaign, Fufa prioritised all the meagre resources at its disposal to facilitate requirements for the success of the team and campaign. Fufa is committed to ensuring all his salary arrears are cleared and we are confident this will be handled. However, Fufa were not particular in their statement regarding details in the dues they owe the coach, or how many months the Serbian has gone without pay. But Daily Nation Sport can reveal that Fufa owe the Serbian five months in salary arrears, amounting to $60,000 (Sh6million). Our sources at Fufa also indicate that Micho earns about $12,000 (Sh1.2m) a month. Daily Nation Sport also understands that while the coach s bonuses for the just-ended Afcon campaign were cleared by Fufa, together with the players and his technical team, the federation still owe Micho windfalls from the two Chan qualifiers against Sudan and as many World Cup qualifying ties against Togo. Fufa s bonus system for Cranes players in competitive engagements is silent on coaches amounts, but it indicates that players get $2,000 (Sh200,000) for a win, $1,000 (Sh100,000) a draw and $500 (Sh50,000) for a loss. If we are to use the players structure, Micho is due $8,000 (Sh800,000) for the four home and away wins against Sudan and Togo. Micho is also entitled to some air tickets back home at least once a year and we understand that Fufa are yet to reimburse the coach for at least two or so of them. A return ticket from Entebbe to Belgrade, Serbia via United Arab Emirates is $1600 (Sh160,000). The total dues owed to the coach in salary arrears, match bonuses and air tickets then come to Shs235m.SUED FUFAIt could be more since the coaches are said to earn more in bonuses yet we used the players structure of $2000. Earlier, it had come to our understanding that Micho had filed a case at the Fifa dispute resolution chamber in Zurich demanding that Fufa clear his outstanding salary and other dues. Let my lawyer do his part as I also do my professional job with the team, Micho told Daily Nation Sport on Thursday. As for me, I can only continue planning for the team. By press time, we were still unable to independently verify with the Fifa dispute resolution chamber in Zurich whether a case from Micho had been received.THE BREAKDOWNFive-month salary: $60,000 (Sh6m)Matches where coach is owed (@2000 USD)17/10/15: Uganda 2 0 Sudan (Chan)25/10/15: Sudan 0 2 Uganda (Chan)12/11/15: Togo 0 1 Uganda (WCQ)15/11/15: Uganda 3 0 Togo (WCQ)Total bonuses owed to Micho: $8000 (Sh800,000)Air Tickets: $1600 (Sh160,000) email print email print The first batch of doctors will be promoted by October 7.
