Anti-terrorism police have arrested the widow of slain and controversial Muslim cleric Sheikh Aboud Rogo, who was gunned down four years ago, at her home in Kikambala, Kilifi county.Hania Said Sagar was arrested after several officers stormed her house at around 6pm.The officers confiscated her phone before driving off with her to an unknown place. According to a family member, the police said they were taking her to the Mtwapa Police Station. One of the officers slapped the watchman before accessing the house. I was the one who was outside but they said they were only interested in our Mum. They said they were taking her to the Mtwapa Police Station, said the family member. The family said they visited the station but were told she was not there. Our mother suggested that they wait for her lawyer but the officers, who had already taken her phone, drove away with her, in a Range Rover, she added. We are worried. They used this on the late Aboud Rogo. We have not had any issues of late and we expect they will return our mother, said another relative, who spoke to Nation.co.ke by phone.Mr Rogo, described by Kenyan and Western security agencies as an Al-Shabaab recruiter, was gunned down on the Mombasa-Malindi road on August 27, 2012. An inquest into his killing opened in 2013. In October 2015, police were absolved from blame in the killing. A Mombasa magistrate said at the end of the inquest that there was no evidence of culpability on the part of the National Police Service Commission or any individual officer. email print email print Kenya is lobbying against the planned agreement between US and 12 Asian states for fear of losingPeres will be buried next to Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to
