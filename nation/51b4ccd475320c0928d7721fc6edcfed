The Orange Democratic Movement wants individual party strength to be the benchmark of picking Cord s presidential flagbearer, the clearest indication yet that its leader Raila Odinga will not be stepping down for any of his partners, the Nation has learnt.This will only complicate the relationship in the triumvirate that brings together Wiper s Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford-Kenya s Moses Wetang ula, even as coalition leaders downplay prospects of schism in the four-year old outfit.In response, the two coalition partners are digging in for a fight even as it turns out that the council of elders set up four months ago after the famous Manzoni meeting when the trio made a unity pledge has not covered much ground in identifying Cord s next flagbearer.The development also makes nonsense of the work of the elders Senators James Orengo (Siaya, ODM), Johnson Muthama (Machakos, Wiper) and MP Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren, Ford Kenya). Alongside a team of external advisors, they were to advise on the best formation that would defeat President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto in the August 8 elections next year.Although the spokesmen of the respective parties Hassan Omar (Wiper), Eseli Simiyu (Ford-K) and Agnes Zani (ODM) say the heightened activities in each party is meant to strengthen Cord, this is far from the truth.On Saturday, the coalition s executive committee meeting had to be postponed at the last minute because all the parties were busy popularising their own ambitions.While Mr Odinga led his troops in Narok and Kisumu, Mr Musyoka was in Tana River and Tononoka Grounds, Mombasa, while Mr Wetang ula was in Kakamega for various rallies.The Orange party is putting up a strong case for Mr Odinga in the ongoing renegotiations for the coalition s line-up, saying he deserves one more chance due to the sacrifices he has made over the years .BEST FORMULAMr Odinga s allies say the strength of each party is the best formula to break the deadlock on who is more deserving to take on President Kenyatta at the polls. They say anointing a person with less national presence could disenfranchise the majority party and possibly cause voter apathy. Compared with Wiper and Ford-K, our bases have largely remained intact. It would thus be unfair to force our party leader to endorse somebody who does not even command 100 per cent support in any given county yet he wants to be called an equal partner, an ally of Mr Odinga told the Nation.Mr Odinga himself didn t mince words when he addressed party supporters in Narok on Friday: There is a difference between ODM and other parties; just like in religion where Muslims cannot be Christians, Catholics cannot be Seventh Day Adventists and vice versa .He asked them to focus on strengthening ODM ahead of the General Election, saying they were not keen on going to the polls as a coalition but as an individual outfit and to field a presidential candidate. These sentiments further put a damper on the Cord spirit.But in a damage control mode a day later, Mr Odinga denied that Cord was on the verge of collapse due to differences among coalition principals.Speaking on Saturday during a fundraising meeting in aid of Segero Central Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church in Soy constituency, Uasin Gishu County, Mr Odinga said Cord was still intact, contrary to media reports that it was on the verge of disintegrating ahead of next year s polls. Cord is a coalition of political parties that include Ford Kenya, Wiper and ODM and we had a mutual agreement whereby we resolved that each party must strengthen itself because you are not going to go into the elections as one party, said Mr Odinga.CALLED OFFThe Cord principal explained why the retreat that was to come up with a formula on fielding a single presidential candidate under the coalition ticket was called off recently. The retreat was not cancelled, as reports by a section of the media indicated. It was called off by mutual agreement among the principals; that it be postponed until further notice. But meetings are ongoing among key party leaders and supporters. ODM is a house and Cord is a village. In a political coalition, the coalition is a home whereas the parties are the houses within a home; so there is a house called ODM, another one called Wiper and the other one Ford Kenya, and there are still more houses being erected in this compound, he said.While Mr Odinga s key lieutenants like Senator Orengo are careful not to antagonise their Wiper and Ford-K counterparts in public, part of the strategy, it appears, is to force the other parties into submission by engaging in vigorous campaigns for Mr Odinga with unequivocal pronouncements that his name must be on the ballot. This has been the overarching message in a series of rallies in Mombasa, and in Kisumu on Saturday.As a sign that all is not well in the opposition outfit, the parties have been working at cross purposes on whether to field joint candidates in the upcoming elections. While Mr Odinga s party and that of Mr Musyoka have come out in favour of this method, albeit with pockets of opposition from within, members of Mr Wetang ula s brigade such as Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale will hear none of it.ODM is the largest party in Kenya by the number of elected representatives, although it has witnessed about a dozen defections to the ruling Jubilee alliance. Compared with Wiper s 29 (25 MPs and four governors) and Ford-K s 11 (10 MPs and one governor), ODM boosts 113 (96 MPs, and 17 governors).PARTY STRENGTHMr Musyoka downplays the issue of party strength, terming it immaterial when it comes to picking the torchbearer. This should not count because that party strength in Parliament was influenced by the fact of flagship during the 2013 General Election. If, for instance, I was the flagbearer, Wiper with 30 MPs would have doubled that figure to at least 60, he says.Mr Musyoka and Mr Wetang ula, just like their Orange counterpart, have come under immense pressure from their respective supporters not to shelve their State House ambitions in favour of anyone, with aspirants running on their parties hoping to ride on the wave of their tickets to propel them to county assemblies, parliament and county governor seats.Before he made the statement that promises to shape Cord s political architecture, Mr Odinga had recently said there was ample time for the coalition to unveil its candidate.Around the same time, Mr Musyoka had said that unity of the coalition came before anything else for him.But it is Mr Wetang ula who is said to be uneasy about such prospects, with his lieutenants fearing the entry of ANC boss Musalia Mudavadi could overshadow him.But there is almost a consensus in the two parties that even with Mr Wetang ula out, the coalition would be the richer were they to swap places with Mr Mudavadi, given that his party got about 25 MPs and attracted 500,000 presidential votes in the last elections.Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka and his Jubilee-leaning county Assembly further make Senator Wetang ula s backyard a veritable political battleground.Mr Wetang ula has been trying to flex his muscles in the larger Western region, the same place Mr Odinga s party has a heavy presence.Just a day after Mr Odinga addressed rallies in Narok, Mr Wetang ula embarked on a vote hunting mission in the area. The decision was frowned upon by many in the former prime minister s quarters. They saw it as an act of war. MAA NATION Mr Wetang ula is set for an extensive tour of Narok County tomorrow, October 2 due to demand from supporters from the Maa nation, aide Chris Mandu said in a dispatch to newsrooms on Saturday.On Friday, Mr Wetang ula said his party would field candidates in all elective posts next year.He said the party was working on a method of consolidating its strength. We have candidates lined up to vie on Ford Kenya s ticket and not as a coalition, he said.As it stands, there is bound to be re-organisation in Cord, a process that could see new players come in or all the principal members go separate ways. But whatever happens, the entities will be guided by the numbers each brings to the table.Should ODM choose to go it alone, the next question would be on Mr Odinga s running mate. Mr Musyoka and Mr Wetang ula would be forced to shop for new alliances, or even team up and faceoff with Mr Kenyatta and Mr Odinga at the ballot, giving Mr Kenyatta an easy sail into a second term in office.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, the man hogging all the limelight in Mr Odinga s camp, has been touted as a possible second-in-command.Governor Joho s meteoric rise and closeness to the opposition chief is already causing jitters in Cord.In various events, he has played a critical role in amassing party supporters tto endorse Mr Odinga for the top job in 2017.
