Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua on Wednesday survived impeachment after senators rejected all the charges brought against him. The Nyeri county assembly had accused Mr Gachagua of gross violation of the Constitution, the County Governments Act, the Public Finance Management Act and the Public Procurement and Disposal Act. According to the Annual Budget Implementation Status Report for the financial year 2015/16, a sum of Sh1.161 billion was utilised under the development expenditure. However, projects expenditure in the same report amounts to Sh808.29 million, leaving a sum of Sh352.98 million unaccounted for, the assembly said in the letter to the Senate. Mr Gachagua is the fourth governor to be recommended for impeachment by ward representatives and as has happened previously. Of the last three, only Embu Governor Martin Wambora was found guilty of the accusations against him and his impeachment was confirmed. He, however, contested the decision in court and his impeachment was quashed.Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony and his Murang a counterpart Mwangi Wa Iria kept their jobs after the accusations against them were dropped by the senators.
