Josh Murphy's superb strike from the edge of the area in the 74th minute completed the upset."I can't criticise the players. We played well but weren't clinical enough. The difference was Norwich were clinical with their two chances," Koeman said.NEVER WON LEAGUE CUPAt Dean Court, Makienok, who hadn't scored in his previous 19 appearances, gave Preston the lead in the 10th minute before Bournemouth equalised through Lewis Grabban's 53rd minute penalty.Dan Gosling put the hosts ahead from close range in the 76th minute, only for Makienok to force extra-time in the 85th minute and then win it for Simon Grayson's men in the 111th minute.Lucas Perez's first goals for Arsenal inspired a 4-0 rout of second-tier Nottingham Forest at the city Ground.Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, who has never won the League Cup, made 11 changes from the team that thrashed Hull on Saturday and the understudies went ahead in the 23rd minute through a long-range effort from Switzerland midfielder Granit Xhaka.Spanish striker Perez, who arrived from Deportivo La Coruna on transfer-deadline day, opened his Arsenal account in his third appearance with a 60th-minute penalty after a foul on Chuba Akpom.Perez got his second in the 71st minute and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain got Arsenal's fourth in stoppage time.Liverpool, last year's beaten finalists, remain on course for a return to Wembley after a 3-0 win against Championship side Derby at the iPro Stadium.Reds boss Jurgen Klopp made seven changes, including a debut for goalkeeper Loris Karius, but his team were still unstoppable as they took their goal tally to 19 in seven matches this season.Estonia centre-back Ragnar Klavan took advantage of poor Derby defending to fire home in the 24th minute.Philippe Coutinho doubled Liverpool's lead in the 50th minute and Divock Origi put the result beyond doubt four minutes later.Newcastle defeated Championship rivals Wolves 2-0, Leeds beat fellow second-tier side Blackburn 1-0, while Reading won 2-1 in another all-Championship clash at Brighton. email print email print Justice Isaac Lenaola dismissed the Machakos governor&#039;s petition to block his prosecution.Area police boss Kingsford Nyaga told the Nation that the officers were acting on a tip-off from
