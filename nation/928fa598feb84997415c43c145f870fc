Samwel Muchai claimed gold in the T11 men s 1500m at the Olympic Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday morning. It was Muchai s second gold after winning the 5,000m race on Thursday last week and brings Kenya s medal tally to four.Muchai fended off stiff competition from home favourite Odair Santos to claim the top honours in 4 minutes 03.25 seconds, while Santos - who also finished second in the 5,000m - settled for silver in 4 minutes, 03.85 seconds. Turkey s Deniz Semih took the bronze in 4.05.42.TRADITIONAL DANCEIt was, however, disappointment for Wilson Bii, who wound fourth in 4.07.98. As has been his tradition, Muchai, guided by James Boit, began the race at a high speed and maintained his pace even as Santos and Bii breathed down his neck. Bii, who took bronze in the 5,000m, at one point seemed destined for third but when the bell was sounded, Muchai and Santos showed him a clean pair of heels while Deniz was also not left behind either as each came to the final bend.At the home straight, the battle for gold narrowed down to the indefatigable Muchai and the Brazilian, who had spoiled a clean sweep for Kenya in the 5,000m, showing his ugly intent but Muchai was in no mood to play second fiddle, speeding to cross the line before bursting into wild celebrations.Muchai s time of 4.03.25 was his season s best but it fell short of the world record he set in London in 2012, when he clocked 3.58.37.Kenya is still in the hunt for more medals in the T12 5,000m where Henry Kirwa will be flying the national flag.
