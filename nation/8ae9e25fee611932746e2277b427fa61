School managers have been told they are to blame for cases of student unrest as many of them focus and emphasise on academic performance at the expense of the welfare of children.Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association national chairman John Awiti said on Thursday that students tend to rebel when schools deny them an opportunity to exploit other talents. They tend to feel the school is treating them unfairly and that is not learner friendly and the result is burning their schools and engaging in other malpractices to make sure they get attention and they are heard, he told over 700 principals from ten counties meeting in Nakuru to explore ways of managing emerging challenges in the institutions. When you only emphasize on academics as a principal, you deny the child who would exploit his or her God given talent which is outside the academic world, said Mr Awiti who is the principal of St Marys Yala.The school heads are drawn from Nairobi, Kericho, Narok, Uasin Gishu, Kajiado, Kirinyaga, Nyeri, Kiambu, Baringo and hosts Nakuru.Mr Awiti at the same time said many school heads are not conversant on latest management skills on how to address adolescents and had failed to incorporate the feelings of learners.The Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association organized the two day management workshop for the principals to discuss indiscipline in schools and how to manage disasters.The workshop at Hotel Kunste comes at the backdrop of a series of student unrest across the country which saw several schools burnt down and property worth millions of shillings destroyed.Among others, the head teachers are analysing past taskforce reports on indiscipline in Kenyan schools and reviewing procedures of handling discipline cases versus children rights and adolescent management. They are also looking at the TSC Code of Conduct and Code of Regulation 2015.The Director of Secondary and Tertiary Education Robert Masese accused the school heads of blindly adopting and borrowing management styles from other schools and forcing them on their students without interrogating their practicability.Mr Awiti said election of student leaders should not have been endorsed by principals as it has led to poor leadership in some schools. We allow the students to conduct the elections without guiding them and they end up electing populist students who don t abide by the school rules and regulations, said Mr Awiti.The workshops are being conducted in phases with the first one having been held in Kisii County and the second one in Kitale.The next phase will be in Meru and the last one in Mombasa County. email print email print Peres will be buried next to Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to Ms Tutui said the court would have given orders for immediate realisation of the rule.
