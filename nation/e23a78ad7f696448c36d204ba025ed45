Have you listened to Blinky Bill s newest EP? It s a promising work of entertaining, out-of-the-box, alternative art, which is what we have come to expect from Blinky and the Just A Band band. If you don t know who I am talking about, I speak of one third of the three geniuses that make up Just A Band, arguably one of Kenya s most revolutionary collectives, made up of Bill Sellanga aka Blinky Bill, Mbithi Masya and Daniel Muli. Though Just A Band split up this year to delve into their various interests music, movies and comics they are still producing art at a beautiful pace. Blinky s EP, amusedly named We Cut Keys While You Wait , just released its first video what sounds like an introductory sound bite called Kwani Iko Nini . The video features the stylings of a hula hoop maestro and a kwaito-influenced dancer in a dimly lit popular studio off Ngong Road, dancing to a heavily pulsing beat that builds up your excitement for a song to begin and then leaving you high and dry, in anticipation of the next song. Blinky is seen briefly in the video, nodding to his own beat at the beginning, then being startled at the end, as if the flames at the end of the hula hoop put him into a trance. And that s just a taste of what he has to offer.
