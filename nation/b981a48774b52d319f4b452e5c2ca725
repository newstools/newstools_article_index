Q. Is it right to ask what is included in your benefit package during an interview? Dear Hazel,Employed appropriately, questions are handy instruments through which to seek the awareness and clarity needed to make the right decisions, not the least of which relate to careers.Although there are cases where a successful candidate is chosen after only one interview, it is seldom the norm especially for roles that that have long open-ended contracts.There are typically more interviews before the right candidate is selected for a role. During the initial interviews, the attention of interviewers is mostly drawn towards figuring out the suitability of candidates.Candidates would simultaneously be forming more defined impressions of the company and considering whether these conform to their career expectations and tastes.Asking the question on benefits at an early stage could create the unseemly impression of a candidate whose only focus is what they can gain from the company, unalloyed with what they can contribute thereto.Interviewers perception of a candidate s potential contribution to an organisation is a key tenet upon which they base selection decisions. It is therefore important for a candidate to also consider the benefit they would bring to an organisation. Companies take pride in the benefits they offer employees and will therefore be pleased to share this with candidates at some point, often at the later stages of recruitment or indeed once interviewers have isolated the candidate that fits the bill.If the information provided on benefits is scanty or is not forthcoming altogether, this would be a cue and an apt moment to ask the question in order to fully appreciate the company s recipe of benefits.A candidate might also take the chance to enquire whether there are flexibilities around how the organisation s pay and benefits have been tailored. So yes, it is right to ask the question, and also to mind its timing. email print email print I am an urban planning student.
