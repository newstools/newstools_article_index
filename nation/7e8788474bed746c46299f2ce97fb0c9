AT THE MUHORONI COMPLEXMathare United dropped two vital points in their quest for the Kenyan Premier League title after battling to a barren draw with Muhoroni Youth on Wednesday.With influential midfielder Eric Johanna missing, Mathare United coach Francis Kimanzi lined up Whyvonne Isuza alongside skipper Vincent Okello and Duke Abuya to pull strings from midfield but they could not break down the resilient hosts.Moses Arita, captain Francis Ocholla and Sammy Ndungu lined up Muhoroni s new look attack force under new coach Tom Juma with club top scorer Wycliffe Ochomo still in the cold.The 2008 champions had the cutting edge from the midfield but failed to create any meaningful chances in the final third where centre backs Peter Okore and Kelvin Omondi kept the Slum Boys at bay.Arita could have given the hosts the lead five minutes after the break but failed to connect to Ndungu s cross with only keeper Robert Mboya to beat.Okello responded with a powerful shot for Mathare three minutes later but his effort was easily picked by Farouk Shikhalo in Muhoroni s goal.Mathare custodian Mboya was then put to task by Benjamin Mosha from the inside the box but he managed to parry the effort for a fruitless corner.Derrick Onyango headed wide from a Daniel Mwaura cross before Muhoroni coach Tom Juma summoned former Palos FC striker Calvince Omanga and Ugandan forward Andrew Ssekayombya for Arita and skipper Ocholla in the 65th minute.Mathare, who kicked-off second half strongly, continued to pin the hosts in their own half with Isuza, Abuya and Onyango terrorising the Muhoroni danger area.Mathere coach Francis Kimanzi rested Okello for the pacy Harrison Mwendwa with 10 minutes left on the clock but the hosts held on to pick a point. We had planned to pick all the three points but somehow the boys did not play according to instructions. We are going to the drawing board to prepare for Gor Mahia on Sunday, Juma said after the match. It was a tough game but I feel we deserved to win because we controlled the match. We play Bandari next after a week and that should give us enough time to prepare, Kimanzi said.The draw leaves Mathare nine points below leaders Tusker, who have a game in hand, with five matches to the end of the season.Muhoroni tackle Gor Mahia in the KPL Top 8 Knockout tournament final on Sunday in Mombasa. email print email print Mr Tom Cheruiyot Biegon states that Justice Maraga erroneously reduced the murder charge againstThe airline has released advance extracts of its financial results in an attempt to counter a
