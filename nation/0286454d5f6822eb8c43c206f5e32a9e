People seeking treatment for alcohol dependence and whose goal is to quit drinking entirely are more likely to achieve this goal if they are treated by a care provider who advocates total abstinence, the University of Gothenburg in Sweden wrote on its website on a press release on Monday, citing results of its own study. Those who wish to learn to drink in moderation are not as successful, even when they are treated by a care provider who works with controlled consumption.The research, titled Is There a Need for Congruent Treatment Goals Between Alcohol-Dependent Patients and Caregivers? , followed up 201 adult patients two-and-a-half years after onset of treatment. It shows that a shared view between patient and care provider was not decisive for the treatment outcome. Instead, states associate professor Kristina Berglund, who studies dependence at the university s department of psychology, patients whose goal was total abstinence were more successful than those who had chosen to control their drinking. Around 90 per cent of patients who were in agreement with their care provider on total abstinence were still sober at follow-up, whereas only 50 per cent who were in agreement with their care provider on controlled consumption treatment had succeeded in controlling their drinking at follow-up.According to associate professor Kristina Berglund, It is easy to believe that the patient and care provider having a common goal is the most important factor in achieving good treatment outcomes, but it is not that simple. Our study shows that, regardless of agreement on goals and methods, in the end it is more difficult to stick to controlled drinking than to give it up entirely. The study is in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.
