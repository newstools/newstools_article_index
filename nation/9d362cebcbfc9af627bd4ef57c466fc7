Residents of Makueni County will have a chance to assess, celebrate and critique the achievements of the county government after the Devolution Torch is handed over to Governor Kivutha Kibwana by his Kitui counterpart Julius Malombe on Friday. The Devolution Torch, an Olympic-style torch, is intended to go through the 47 counties, the purpose being to collect and receive feedback from county residents on the successes and challenges of devolution at the counties, according to a June 10, 2016 letter to all governors by Council of Governors (CoG) Chief Executive Officer Jacqueline Mogeni. The torch has already been to Wajir and Kitui counties and will Friday be passed on to Makueni by Dr Malombe at a ceremony in Wote before it is taken across the sub-counties in the next two days. The handing over of the torch is a symbolic ceremony that is meant to ensure that the spirit of devolution is kept alive across all the devolved zones, Joe Muburi, an official in charge of the Devolution Torch events told the Nation on Thursday. He added, During the interactive events across the sub-counties, residents will be able to celebrate what devolution has achieved and also vent their frustrations in cases where they feel devolution has not worked to their expectation. After going through all the counties, he said, the CoG will create a television programme on the various experiences that will create a picture of the successes and shortfalls of devolving power and resources to the counties. Zipporah Wambua the Makueni County director in charge of public participation, said the county government will use the opportunity to underline the need for citizens to take charge of development by getting involved in proposing and managing development projects. email print email print Ceremony will be like a relay race where the receiving governor passes the devolution torch over to his counterpart at the county borders.
