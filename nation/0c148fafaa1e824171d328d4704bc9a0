SELENKAY RESERVEIn the Maasai heartland of southern Kenya, some young men have swapped their ancestral role as lion-hunters to instead protect the big cats under a conservation scheme that also aims to help their community.Among them is Leiyio Lengete, a "Moran" or warrior who wears a scarlet blanket over his shoulders, a blue one around his hips, and a multitude of fine multicoloured beaded bracelets on his forearms, ankles and neck.Large half-moon shaped metal earrings and a beaded headband set off his long elaborately braided hair, but instead of a traditional spear, he clasps a GPS receiver.Maasai "Morans" (warrior) track lions on foot through a patch of scrub, on September 11, 2016, at the Selenkay community conservancy.

Everything we do is about the community," Dolrenry told AFP."The guardians spend a lot of their time finding livestock, finding lost herders, even little children who got lost in the bush. The guardians are there, they are able to go tracking, they know the bush," said the 37-year-old American.Around a million dollars' worth of lost livestock was returned by the guardians to their owners last year, she said.The work boosted the Morans' status within their community while their almost daily contact with the lions maintained their traditional aura.When a cow is killed, for instance, they step in to dissuade cattle-owners from punitive raids against the lions, arguing that their own jobs recovering lost cattle are at stake as well as those of the Maasai community who make up almost all the staff of the two lodges in the wildlife reserve.THRIVING COMMUNITYA lioness wearing a radio-collar sits in some shade after an afternoon meal on September 11, 2016, at the Selenkay community conservancy, where some of the indigineous Maasai "Morans" have foregone their ancestral role as lion-hunters to instead protect the big cat under a conservation scheme named "Lion Guardians".

Other wildlife has also benefited, with buffaloes reappearing in the reserve recently after years of absence, elephants moving in herds and the presence in the area of animals hard to find elsewhere in Kenya such as the Cape eland or the giraffe gazelle."Lion Guardians", which also has programmes in Tanzania, Rwanda and Zimbabwe, works with private funding, most of it from the US. The Selenkay project runs on less than Sh30 million ($300,000, 269,000 euros) a year.It kicked off with a mere five guardians but now employs more than 40, each of them paid the minimum monthly Kenyan wage of $120 (108 euros).One of the most recent recruits is Mitiaki Kitasho, who asked for a job as a guardian a year ago after twice serving a month behind bars for illegally killing first an elephant, then a lion."There's not a single species I haven't killed to protect the community and to gain popularity and respect," he said.But courage no longer puts food on the table, and after being released from jail penniless, he went to Lion Guardians looking for a job.Now, like the Maasai warriors, he can continue to do what he loves and does best track the big cats. email print email print President Kenyatta urged qualified Kenyans to apply for the positions of IEBC chairperson and All the mock examination papers bear the portrait of Governor Cornell Rasanga
