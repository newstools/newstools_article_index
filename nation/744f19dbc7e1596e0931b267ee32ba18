Former Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) CEO Maurice Okoth has been acquitted of corruption claims. Speaking to Showbuzz about his victory he said: I m so relieved! When something like this happens you lose your confidence. I couldn t even give advice to people or stand up to talk to them because it really affected my life. It took my confidence, my leadership ability and guidance capabilities. But I m thankful to God because I ve been surrounded by supportive friends and family.He says some of his biggest supporters including his wife were Big Kev and Big Ted who together will offer a thanksgiving for his victory. Others include Shaffie Weru, Nameless, Wahu, Nonini, and Susan Gachukia. The judge found no basis of charging me. We went to a higher court and told the judge that our rights were being abused so that he could stop the trial from continuing. The aim of this debacle was to tarnish our name, he said.Despite the case being thrown out of court he says there are people who still believe that they were guilty. Is there a future for him back at MCSK? I cannot return to MCSK under the leadership role I had but if anybody asked me to do anything I would take up an external consultancy role. I love music and entertainment; I have a love for culture and the creative industry. I m happy I m vindicated and I wouldn t wish this on anyone, he said. email print email print Kenya is lobbying against the planned agreement between US and 12 Asian states for fear of losingPeres will be buried next to Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to
