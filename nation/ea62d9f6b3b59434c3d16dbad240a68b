Limuru Country Club s John Karichu picked up his second straight Golfer Of The Year title despite returning poor scores during the weekend s Tea Fields Trophy golf tournament at the par 70 Kericho Golf Club course.The 2015 Goty champion, who has been struggling to regain his form, carded an eight over par 78 in the opening round and a two over par 72 in the closing round for a total of 10 over par 150, a very poor score for a 36-hole event. Karichu, who beat home player Edward Masiga by one shot, blamed the poor score on the conditions of the greens. The course was good but the greens were very difficult for putting, said Railway s Alfred Nandi, who took the first round honours on six over par 76. Limuru s John Kariuki posted 72 gross to claim the second.In the nett section, Richard Korir carded 69 to beat Charles Kipngok by a shot while Reuben Langat posted nett 70.
