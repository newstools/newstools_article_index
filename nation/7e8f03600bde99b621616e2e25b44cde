A section of tea farmers in Kisii County have vowed to continue with their demonstration Monday to protest deductions in their bonus payments. The farmers from Irondi in Nyaribari Chache Sub-County say they were yet to be given concrete explanations as to why their bonus pay-outs were deducted. "We have been silent as we wait for an explanation that has not been forthcoming, said Mr Abel Moranga. We have now decided to go to the streets. We hope the demos will jolt the directors of our tea factories to action. We will not suffer in silence, he went on. City-based philanthropist Ben Mogaka vowed to support the farmers in their protests. "We cannot sit and watch as farmers suffer. I promise to support them without fear until the directors give a clear explanation where their money is," Mr Mogaka said. email print email print The Budalang&#039;i MP will rebrand the Labour Party of Kenya, touted as the Third Force.
