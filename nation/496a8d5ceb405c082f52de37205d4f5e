LONDONDavid Luiz insists he is willing to play in a variety of roles for Chelsea following his surprise move back to Stamford Bridge.Luiz rejoined the Premier League club from Paris Saint-Germain on transfer deadline day last month and has been renewing old acquaintances at Chelsea's Cobham training ground this week.The 29-year-old's arrival gives Chelsea manager Antonio Conte increased options as he can play in a traditional centre-half role, but also in defensive midfield.Luiz could make up part of a back three with Gary Cahill and John Terry when Chelsea resume domestic action at Swansea on Sunday as Conte has often preferred to play 3-5-2 or 3-4-3 formations.Luiz, who became the world's most expensive defender when he left Chelsea for PSG in 2014, has no issues with whatever position he is required to fill for the team."I started playing three at the back with Vitoria in Brazil, but it doesn't matter where, I want to help and when I am in the team I am there to try to help," Luiz told Chelsea's website on Wednesday."The coach is an amazing coach, he understands a lot of tactical things and I know he chooses every match the best line up, so if he needs to play three, four or two, it doesn't matter, I am there if he wants me to play. In different positions I am available."During his last spell at Chelsea, Luiz was part of the side which won the Champions League and FA Cup in 2012, then the Europa League in the following season.However, the Premier League title remains missing from his English honours list."It is time to do it, and I hope it will be this year. I am working hard for that and this is our goal this season," he added."We don't have the Champions League to fight for so for sure we will try to win the Premier League and both cups." email print email print Ms Tutui said the court would have given orders for immediate realisation of the rule. But the passport was not stamped, meaning he did not pass through the immigration desk.
