Leading online and mobile sports betting firm Betway have unveiled their newest promotion to reward sports betting fans in the Kenyan market.Similar to their previous 3,000 Prizes in 30 Days promotion, Betway is raising the bar by offering betting fans the chance to win 30,000 prizes in 30 days. That s 10 times more than the preceding promotion.The promotion begins on Saturday and runs until midnight on October 30. It will see 1,000 prizes given away daily to lucky individuals. These prizes include airtime, cash credits, free bets and one lucky daily winner who will receive a Tecno C9 smartphone.Every day one of the 1,000 daily winners will be selected to go into a Grand Prize draw at the end of the promotion where they stand the chance of winning an Isuzu double-cab. To participate in the promotion, customers need only bet Sh100 to gain one entry into the daily prize draw.Participants who bet higher amounts will earn more entries and gain a higher chance of winning a daily prize, but the best chances to win will go to those who bet the minimum of Sh100 every day for the duration of the promotion. The 30,000 prizes in 30 days will be the largest promotion that Betway has run in Kenya to date and is indicative of both the success the company is seeing in the Kenyan market and the love of football that the country shares.Betway is confident that this promotion will attract new interest from football fans. email print email print Investigators were still looking for the girl to establish whether the act was truly committed.
