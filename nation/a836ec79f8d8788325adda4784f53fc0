Blinky Bill is one-third of the alternative genius band Just A Band, who are currently on a break from making musical magic. Well, in his case, he is making it solo now. Aside from his excellent deejaying skills, he has just released his eclectic electric Extended Play (EP), We Cut Keys While You Wait . 1. If you were an athlete in the Kenyan team, would you change your nationality for better terms?Without even blinking. I love Kenya, but if other people see more value in you than your country does, then I d definitely go where I am valued. 2. How is the two-year Just A Band break going? Pretty well. I ve just dropped my EP. It s called We Cut Keys While You Wait. I also just played at TEDSummit in Canada recently. Mbithi is having his new film premier at the Toronto International Film Festival in October, and Dan is working on his comics, so everyone is growing pretty well. It s great to watch. 3. Do you think you guys are ever going to try and replicate the Makmende effect?It was great for the time but we are forever going to be wanderers, so while it s a great thing that happened, we want to explore other things. Maybe one day we can come back and complete the story. Time will tell. 4. What, in your wildest dreams, is the ultimate accomplishment for you musically?To be in studio working with my heroes internationally, Pharrell, Black Coffee and the likes. That would be my dream come true! 5. What do you think you are doing to fix Kenya, in whatever way?I think by working to push the sonic boundaries of what Kenyan music is supposed to sound like, and hopefully future generations will see it in that way. email print email print Mr Ruto said that Mr Mwangi posted the tweet on September 28The increasingly influential Mombasa governor is leading ODM leaders from Nyanza to mark the
