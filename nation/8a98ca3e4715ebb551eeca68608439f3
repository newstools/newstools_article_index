I first read this book 10 years ago, and have been meaning to return to it ever since. So Long A Letter still stands the test of time, I am pleased to report. Ramatoulaye Fall s husband, Modou, is dead, and she writes a letter to her best friend, Aissatou, telling her how she is dealing with the death, in between taking anot-so-quick trip back into their intertwined pasts. This slim volume is full of beautiful language and heady truths on friendship, love, and one of the best and most eloquent break-up letters I have ever read. I would love to be able to write like this woman even today. Friendship has splendours that love knows not. It grows stronger when crossed, whereas obstacles kill love. Friendship resists time, which wearies and severs couples. It has heights unknown to love. Get it at any well-stocked bookshop wherever you are. email print email print Edna Osoro, 27, was selling tomatoes when she was struck and killed.This means that the power distributor would have to put in a clause on compensation in contracts
