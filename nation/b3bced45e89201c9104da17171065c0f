An earthquake in the north western part of Tanzania on Saturday afternoon caused panic as tremors shook parts of the North Rift, Western and Nyanza regions.The quake, measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale, hit the Kagera region, a rural area on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria next to Tanzania s border with Uganda. It was blamed on tectonic movements by the weatherman who said there could not be damage on the Kenyan side since what was felt are only ripple effects.Tremors were felt in Kakamega, Busia, Eldoret, Kisii, Nyamira and Kitale, while NTV Uganda reported that Kigali and Kampala too shook for a few moments. The epicentre of the quake is beyond our border but we are in touch with the Tanzanian government who are monitoring the situation for aftershocks, Assistant Director of Weather at the Kenya Meteorological Services Peter Macharia told the Sunday Nation. These are tectonic movements deep in the earth that you cannot predict like the weather, he said. There were no immediate reports of casualties but the AFP reported that some houses had caved in due to the massive shaking of the ground, although there were conflicting reports on whether there were any casualties.In Kakamega, the tremor lasted for about 20 seconds and was accompanied by a loud rumble at 3.28 pm.People who were going about their activities and those following proceedings on the launch of the Jubilee Party in social places scampered for safety fearing that buildings would collapse.At the Megamall located on the Kakamega-Webuye road near Muliro Grounds, residents who were shopping at a supermarket were seen fleeing in panic after the tremor started shaking the building.Mr Kenneth Odanga from Muraka village near Khayega market said he was walking along a street in town when he heard a loud rumbling noise and felt the earth shake for a few seconds. The whole thing caught me by surprise. I just noticed people running in panic and saying the earth was shaking, said Mr Odanga.The Red Cross confirmed through a tweet that no damage had been reported while US geological experts blamed the quake on seismologic activity along the Rift Valley fault line. Kenya has not experienced serious earthquakes since 1928, when the violent tectonic movements opened massive fissures near Lake Nakuru, renowned worldwide for its rare species of flamingos. email print email print Kenya is lobbying against the planned agreement between US and 12 Asian states for fear of losingPeres will be buried next to Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to
