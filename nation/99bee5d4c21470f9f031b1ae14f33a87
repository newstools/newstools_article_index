The race s Local Organising Committee chairman Major (rtd) Charles Chesire said he expects tough races in both categories.

Registration closes on Saturday at 4pm. We were over 1000 participants as at Friday morning and we expect to hit 2000. He added that more monitors have been introduced on the course to curb cheating. The course has been slightly changed to ensure the race meets IAAF standards. The race will end outside Zion Mall and not the traditional Family Bank s Eldoret CBD Branch.
