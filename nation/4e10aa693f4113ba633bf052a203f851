PHOTO | CLIVE KYAZZE | NATION MEDIA GROUPThe Starlets were in control in the first five minutes of the game with team captain Mary Kinuthia, lethal striker Neddy Atieno and Esse Akida combining well upfront.Atieno should have put Kenya ahead early in the game after Tanzania custodian Fatuma Omari failed to deal with Kinuthia s corner from the left but the Kenyan goal poacher shot wide.Tanzania then grew into the game and the pressure saw them awarded two free kicks from which midfielder Daniel Donisia forced Kenyan keeper Vivian Akinyi into superb saves to deny Sebastian Nkoma s charges.Christine Nafula then used her chest to calmly control a cross from the right and set up set up Atieno whose shot went over the bar.Omari Mwanahamisi then gave Tanzania the lead, beating the Kenyan defence before sending the keeper the wrong way to find the back of the net and jet off in celebration in the 27th minute.With seconds remaining to the breather, Tanzania extended their lead amidst confusion after centre referee Anna Akoyi signaled for a foul, before awarding Omari s strike to give Tanzania a 2-0 advantage.The Kenyan girls protested vehemently, with head coach David Ouma restraining his charges from attacking the referee in that moment of madness.Ouma s charges needed a quick response at the start of the second period and Christine Nafula s goal after 47 minutes looked to have set the pace for the Starlets but the Kilimanjaro Queens held on to lift the title. We are a good team and we beat an equally good team, Tanzanian captain Asha Rashid told Daily Nation Sport at the end of the game.For Starlets coach Ouma, it is yet another lesson for his troops and one they have to learn from if they are going to be a force to reckon with in the continent. We learn from every game and this is no different case. We should have scored two goals before they took the lead but we never executed well, Ouma said.(READ: FT: Harambee Starlets 1-2 Tanzania - Cecafa Women Championship final)In the third place playoff played before the final, Ethiopia recovered from an early Hasifah Nassuna goal to thrash hosts Uganda 4-1.Erhima Zeregaw scored a hat-trick to silence the crowd that had been sent into jubilation by the Crested Cranes early display.
