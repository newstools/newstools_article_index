Rodrigo Duterte shot dead a justice department employee and ordered the murder of opponents, a former death squad member told Parliament today, in explosive allegations against the Philippine president.The self-described assassin testified under oath that he and a group of policemen and ex-communist rebels killed about 1,000 people between 1988 and 2013 on President Duterte s orders, one of them an alleged kidnapper fed alive to a crocodile.Others were garroted, burned, quartered and then buried at a quarry owned by a police officer who was a member of the death squad. Others were dumped at sea to be eaten by fish.Mr Edgar Matobato, 57, made the allegations before Senate, which is investigating alleged extrajudicial killings in Mr Duterte s anti-crime crackdown that police said has left 3,140 people dead in his first 72 days in office.Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre called the claims lies and fabrications and said Mr Matobato is obviously not telling the truth .Mr Duterte s aides said the government s Commission on Human Rights had already investigated the allegations but did not file charges while his son Paolo Duterte called the testimony mere hearsay of a madman .The then head of the Commission on Human Rights, Senator Leila de Lima, told the inquiry Mr Matobato had surrendered to the investigatory body in 2009 and had until recently been in a witness protection scheme.UNINTENTIONALLY IMPEDEDMr Matobato recounted a 1993 death squad mission that was unintentionally impeded by the vehicle of an agent of the justice department s National Bureau of Investigation that was blocking a road on the southern city of Davao.The agent ran out of bullets and was wounded in a shootout before Mr Duterte, the Davao mayor at the time, showed up armed with a submachine gun, Mr Matobato said. Mayor Duterte was the one who finished him off.... He emptied two Uzi magazines on him, Mr Matobato said. I didn t kill anyone unless ordered by Charlie Mike, he said, telling Senate it was the death squad s coded reference to city mayor, referring to then-mayor Duterte.Mr Matobato s testimony fleshed out in gruesome detail for the first time long-running allegations that Mr Duterte was behind the killings of more than a thousand petty criminals, including minors, in Davao, where he was mayor for most of the past two decades. Our job was to kill criminals, rapists, pushers, and snatchers. That s what we did. We killed people almost on a daily basis between 1988 and 2013, Mr Matobato said.He said they also killed Duterte family foes and an international terrorist .
