Mr Nyangwara has threatened to table an impeachment motion against Mr Kidero when MCAs return from recess. He accuses the county boss of failing to implement projects and his manifesto. We gave Cord power but what has it done? We will impeach the governor and work with Jubilee, Mr Nyangwara said on Sunday.Nominated MCA Zulfa Mohammed said the two were openly attending Jubilee meetings. We welcome the two members to the ruling coalition. They are with us now, said Ms Mohammed. Ms Kapeen said she had not made a decision to join Jubilee yet. She also dismissed claims that her attendance of politician William ole Ntimama s burial with Jubilee MCAs meant she was a defector. I did not know the funeral was a Jubilee affair, said Ms Kapeen. I do not support things just because they come from the opposition. I support only those I believe in. Mr Nyangwara said more than 17 MCAs from Cord would support the impeachment motion. Nine MCAs are with Jubilee during the night and pretend to be faithful to Cord during the day, he said. email print email print Until yesterday, he was the presiding Judge of the Court of Appeal in Kisumu.
