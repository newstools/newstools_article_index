President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday told off Cord leader Raila Odinga after the Opposition leader took a swipe at Jubilee during the burial of the late politician William ole Ntimama in Narok.Mr Odinga, while eulogising the former minister, said Mr Ntimama had affirmed his position in ODM and dispelled fears that he had decamped to Jubilee.Mr Odinga was referring to a recent visit to State House in Nairobi by Mr Ntimama where the Maasai hero rallied the community to back the President's re-election bid in the 2017 polls. The Cord leader told the crowd that Mr Ntimama had called him after the State House visit and said he had only visited the "Kenyatta wing" of the Jubilee administration because it supported the preservation of the Mau Forest.Deputy President William Ruto, who is in Zambia representing President Kenyatta, opposed the eviction of locals from the area and used it to attack Mr Odinga during campaigns for the 2013 elections.THINLY-VEILED ATTACKMr Odinga had launched a thinly veiled attack on Mr Ruto, but that did not escape the keen ears of Mr Kenyatta, who reminded Mr Odinga, referring to him as "my brother Raila", that there were no two wings in Jubilee and that they were firmly in power.President Kenyatta humorously slammed Mr Odinga, using a parable of a person eating meat while the other only salivated, meaning the Jubilee administration was already enjoying meat (power) while the Opposition was only swallowing saliva (seeking power), adding that he and his team were in no hurry to relinquish the power.Former President Daniel arap Moi and Tanzanian politician Edward Lowassa were among mourners.Mr Ntimama's body arrived in Narok at exactly 9am.Family members, burial committee members and dignitaries held a brief prayer when the body was taken to his residence at Motonyi for a brief stopover before it was transferred to the burial site.Security was tight as hundreds of mourners streamed in for the burial.RED SHUKASHundreds of Maasai mourners turned up donning red Maasai shukas.Traffic officers were controlling traffic to the burial, with no parking of vehicles allowed on the main highway.The county government of Narok declared Wednesday a public holiday to allow county staff and residents to attend the burial.Four counties donated money for the burial, including Narok, which donated Sh10 million while neighbouring Kajiado County donated Sh1 million.Below, are photos captured during the ceremony:A long queue of mourners attending Ntimama's burial in Narok on September 14, 2016.
