Tanzanian popstar Vanessa Mdee and her R-n-B singer boyfriend Juma Jux have released their much awaited single titled Juu. The release of the collaboration comes weeks after rumours began doing rounds that the 'Niroge' singer was secretly dating American R&amp;B singer Trey Songz who was in Kenya for the fourth season of Coke Studio recording.Songz had posted a photo of him and Mdee cuddling with a caption that read The best girls all reside in Africa and that s real. But Mdee was quick to refute those rumours in a Bongo5 TV interview saying: The pictures going around are misinterpreted, I worked for MTV and had met Trey before. We were cool then and we are cool now. She added that she was still in a happy relationship with Jux and their new song about going to the top together kind of proves it.
