Every Kenyan batsman got runs but it was the three authoritative knocks from opening batsman Irfan Karim, top order bat Rushap Patel and all-rounder Nelson Mandela Odhiambo that ensured it was a stroll in the park for the hosts on the opening day of the Four-Nation One Day International (ODI) Quadrangular Series in Nairobi on Tuesday.Karim, with a stroke-filled century of 101 off just 57 balls, Mandela s brutal unbeaten blitz of 64 off 41 and Rushab s steady 50 off 34 balls steered Kenya to an easy 117-run win over Qatar at the Nairobi Gymkhana Oval.Such was Kenya s dominance; they lost their first wicket, the dangerous Alex Obanda (35 off 29) with the scoreboard reading 67 after 10 overs. At one drop, Rushap and Karim went about business in brisk fashion adding 94 for the second wicket in 12 overs. Captain Rakep Patel enjoyed a brief cameo of 19 off 17, 2003 World Cup hero Collins Obuya enjoyed a brief stay for a run-a-ball 14, talented Karan Kaul stroked 25 off 19 but it was dreadlocked Mandela, who meted out most punishment to the unsuspecting Qatari bowlers.By the time make-shift bowler Sajjad Tammor (3/53) and Iqbal Hussein (2/65) snared five wickets at the back end of the innings; Kenya had already run away with the game with a mammoth score of 355 for 9 in the allotted 50 overs.With a stiff chase ahead, Qatar were set onto the back foot immediately by Kenyan pacemen Nehemiah Odhiambo Ngoche (1/34) and Elijah Asoyo Otieno (3/15) after the pair prized out openers Kamran Khan (11) and Galandar Khan (2/10) at 15 for 2.INTERNATIONAL CLASSSpinner Shem Ngoche (2/58) and Rushab (2/31) wrapped up the match for Kenya although Qatar, who were all out despite one of the players not walking out to bat after an earlier injury in the field, did not look too shabby with the bat.The quartet of Rizwan Iqbar (58), Imran Ashraf (30), Sajjad (42) and Inamul Haq (42) didn t do any harm to their budding reputations as cricketers of international class with solid shifts. We are at home and favourites, said Kenya captain Rakep. There are no easy games in international cricket anymore and we will look to keep up with this type of performance in the upcoming games.
