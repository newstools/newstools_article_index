Over 500 URP delegates in Bomet County have ditched the party in favour of Governor Isaac Ruto s Chama Cha Mashinani party.The move comes at a time when various parties within the Jubilee coalition are expected to dissolve by Thursday and form Jubilee Party.Already in Kisii, a section of Ford People leadership has gone to court to cancel the planned dissolution of their party ahead of the Friday merger.In Bomet, the URP delegates said they were unhappy with what they termed as the hand-picking of delegates to attend the planned party dissolution. As bona fide delegates elected from the grass roots, we are dismayed at the turn of events that saw us locked out of the URP national delegates meeting, said Mr Nicholas Kirui who led the delegates.He accused the URP local branch and members of the National Assembly from the county of ignoring the laid down procedures of selecting the representatives to the conference saying the move was motivated by selfish interests. What happened to the laid down procedures in the party constitution regarding individuals who should attend the National Delegates Conference. This could be a message that we are unwanted in the party anymore and we have decided to chat our own political path from today, said Kirui.While decamping, the delegates vowed to start popularising CCM saying it was an ideal party and that should be embraced nationally.They also vowed to back Governor Ruto s re-election in 2017 and warned Jubilee leaders against planting preferred candidates for the people of Bomet. We are now embarking on building it into a formidable party that will win the election and champion the interest of the common mwananchi now and in the future, Ms Nancy Malel said while reading their resolution.Mr Ruto on his part announced that they will be holding a similar delegates conference for his CCM in Bomet County as the Jubilee carry out theirs in Nairobi.A row has been brewing in the County over the selection of URP delegates to represent the region during the party s delegate s conference scheduled for Thursday.Officials from the region are said to have differed on who should be on the list. According to the branch executive officer Mr Jonathan Langat, five of the officials had been replaced since they had been engaged as public servants with the county administration.In Kisii a section of Ford People leaders have broken ranks with the party chair Albert Nyaundi and went to court to stop the party s dissolution.Led by a party official Jerry Kenyansa, they said there had been no wide consultations within the party ranks before the move was taken.Meanwhile South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya has criticized the planned dissolution of parties saying it is a step back in the country s democratic gains. It is risk and bound to take us to era of dictatorship. Kenya needs more parties to put the government of the day on toes, he told the Nation on Friday.He said there is growing corruption in the Government and called for accountability.(Additional Reporting by Magati Obebo) email print email print Ms Tutui said the court would have given orders for immediate realisation of the rule.
