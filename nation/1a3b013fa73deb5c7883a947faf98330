Sunday s battle for Kenyatta Cup at Ngong Racecourse was synthesised by Manzhouli (Charles Njenga)with sublime vivacity. Deflecting smartly from Iced Waterfall and Grand Slam, Manzhouli pretty much led from the start for Mary Binks, crediting his dam, Lora Lee, for her monstrously glittering career. Autophocus was chiming in well before whaling down to harsh ground conditions. This also affected Belo Horizonte.Red Raider caught everyone s attention as he snapped his fingers to pummel Public Hero in the Zariba Cup. Mkuki did not combust at any stage. Protus Ngugi, Richard Kibet, Onesmus Mutua, Joe Karari and Captain Oruya all buttoned up a double. NGONG RESULTS12.30 pm - First Race - Sir Charles Maiden (1,200m)1. Krumkake (Potus Ngugi)2.
