Organisers of the Tenth African Export and Import Trade Fair have postponed the event to a later date as the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) is fully booked for major events.Exhibitions and Events Organisers Limited chairman Solomon Kinyanjui said they would soon announce the new dates for the event that has in the past brought exhibitors from Europe, Asia, US and around Africa as well as from within Kenya.KICC s Acting Managing Director Elijah Korir informed Dr Kinyanjui that the Tsavo Ballroom had earlier been allocated to another event and was therefore not available for the trade fair earlier scheduled for September 21 to 23.Dr Kinyanjui said he will announce new dates since the available space allocated to them was not adequate to house exhibitors who had confirmed attendance.Events and Exhibitions Limited was also involved in the just concluded Sixth Tokyo International Conference for Africa Development (Ticad VI). It is our joy that Kenya is an attraction to many foreign investors and as a matter of fact, several others had lined up for the mega fete, said Dr Kinyanjui.Dr Kinyanjui said that the change of dates adversely affected their incomes as many exhibitors had booked flights for both cargo and participants which they had to reschedule.Recently, KICC also hosted the 14th United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) and has also been booked for a series of continental and global awards ceremonies by various stakeholders.Dr Kinyanjui said the events help create a working relationship between Kenyan investors and foreign investors who meet during the annual trade fair.He said some foreign contractors settled in Kenya to launch operations after participating in the fair while others made strong networks that provided them with a direct market for their products. email print email print Ms Tutui said the court would have given orders for immediate realisation of the rule.
