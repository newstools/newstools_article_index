The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) on Monday revealed that it would forward the names of about 80 people to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission for investigation into the theft of subsidised fertiliser. The NCPB said police were already investigating some of the people suspected to have repackaged, adulterated and sold the relief fertiliser at the expense of genuine farmers. The board admitted that 43 of its employees colluded with county agricultural extension officers and members of the administration to defraud farmers of the fertiliser that was meant to enable farmers to increase their farm productivity at a low cost. UNDER INVESTIGATIONThe chairman of the NCPB s board, Geoffrey King'ang'i, said a total of 22 top officials suspended in May by Agriculture Principal Secretary Richard Lesiyampe were among those under investigation. Over the next two weeks, we will be taking action against those who are culpable of the malpractice, Mr King ang i said. He said gross malpractices that led to the loss of about 10 per cent of the total amount of the subsidised fertiliser, occured in 16 locations across the country. The suspects are under investigations for fraud, lack of diligence, lack of oversight, poor enforcement of guidelines and failing to report the irregularities.Mr King ang i said a report by a task force formed earlier this year to investigate the misappropriation of fertiliser had already been submitted to the board for action. email print email print The firearm, a G3 rifle, was stolen by the gangsters on a motorcycle after killing the officer inKenyan officials have repeatedly suggested during the past year that direct air links with the US
