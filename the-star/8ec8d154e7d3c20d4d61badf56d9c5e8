Mining CS Dan Kazungu wants Coast ODM leaders to stop criticising the Jubilee administration, saying it has invested more than Sh100 billion for the region s development.He accused Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi of inciting residents against the government by criticising the multibillion projects it implements.The CS was reacting to Joho s recent claims that the standard gauge railway project will increase the region s poverty levels. Kazungu said Kingi criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta for passing the new Land Act.The CS urged the leaders to be careful about their words, particularly during electioneering. Joho said in Mombasa and Kwale recently that the SGR is a plan by the government to impoverish the people, Kazungu said.He questioned why the ODM deputy party leader did not raise the issue when he was the assistant minister for Transport in 2012. Kazungu, a former Malindi MP, said such statements aim to create anger and hatred. Joho said the Mining ministry has no plans to help people, yet we re busy formulating policies that will see 70 per cent of the funds go to the national government and 30 per cent to the counties, where communities will get 10 per cent, he said.Kazungu said the government has invested more than Sh100 billion in Coast to upgrade infrastructure. He said besides the SGR, the government plans to upgrade the Port of Mombasa to make it the gateway of East Africa.Kazungu said other projects include construction of the Dongo Kundu Bypass and upgrade of Ukunda Airport, Malindi Airport, Malindi Sala Gate road and the multibillion Lapsset. How can that be a scheme to make the Coast people poor? he said.
