City Hall has warned the Kenya Power and Lighting Company not to disconnect electricity from its facilities over Sh732 million debt.The city-county says KPLC owes it Sh400 million. The warning comes before expected court intervention.The Nairobi government wants KPLC blocked from disconnecting electricity to public hospitals and schools over power bill.The KPLC threatened to disconnect power at City Hall Annex, Pumwani Hospital, Mama Lucy Hospital, public primary and nursery schools, county depots and to turn off street lights.Court documents say the money was owed by the old City Council and the county says it should be paid by the national government. The administration of Governor Evans Kidero says the bill was not transferred to the county, hence, it should not be forced to pay.Yesterday, a senior county officer said if KPLC switches off power in hospitals, the county will retaliate by clamping entrances of Kenya Power premises over Sh400 million debt. Nairobi demands that amount in unpaid rent for electricity poles and way leaves.Chief administration officer John Ntoiti yesterday said KPLC owes the county Sh362 million in way leaves alone. If we include rent for their poles, then we are talking about more than Sh400 million, he said.In the past, the city has clamped private premises, including five-star hotels and business centres over debts.In October last year, the county clamped the entrance of KPLC s Stima Plaza over a Sh608 million debt for electricity poles and way leaves. This was after the company disconnected electricity to City Hall over Sh400 million debt.On Wednesday evening, the KPLC Power disconnected electricity at City Hall for failing to clear power bills. However, power was restored at midnight.
