Manoj Sai and Abraham Vadada both scored a century as Stray Lions mauled Kongonis by 194 runs to extend their lead at the summit of the NPCA Super league.The two batmen shared a record second wicket stand of 210 runs to lead their side to final total of 358 for six before the bowlers led by Hiren Varaiya finished off the work by bowling them out for 164 in 36.2 overs.After coming together with the board at 57 for one after the dismissal of Tanmay Mishra on 25, Sai and Vadada added 210 for the second wicket as Kongonis bowlers toiled in favourable batting conditions at home.Sai, more fluent with the bat managed to put on his second century of the season posting 152 from 117 balls while Vadada scored his second of the season with 122 from 102.The pair showed their full array of strokes as they punished the wayward Kongonis bowling.Vadada, who was the first to fall to end the huge stand when he was caught off Dominic Wesonga off the last ball of the 43rd over, hit eight boundaries and two sixes.Sai was more brutal in his knock taking the Kongonis bowlers over the boundary in five occasions and 16 fours. His long entertaining inning came to an end with 26 balls to go when he was bowled by Eugene Ochieng.Before Ochieng had troubled his wood, Sai had managed 32 for the third wicket with Salman Ahmed.Ahmed could only manage to score 35 before also falling to Ochieng.Ochieng had his third wicket which was however a drop in the ocean when he had Collins Obuya caught for a golden duck.Shem Obado was the sixth wicket to fall when he was caught for four.Harrison Ambani remained unbeaten on 17.Sai expressed his satisfaction with his knock saying it was a good day for him in the middle. Everything worked well for me. It was a good batting track. I kept cool and got what I got, he said. He added that fatigue took its toll on him otherwise he was going for a double century. I felt I was in a position to get a double ton but I think I got tired and I lost it on a good ball, Sai added.
