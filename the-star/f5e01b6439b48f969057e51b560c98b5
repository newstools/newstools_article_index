Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka will camp in Mombasa on October 1 and 2 to popularise his bid for the Cord presidential ticket. He will meet wiper delegates from the region on Saturday and hold a mega rally in the Tononoka Grounds on Sunday.Announcing his itinerary, Wiper treasurer Hezron Awiti said the party will field its own candidates in all elective positions except the presidency. The Nyali MP denied reports that Cord will hold a joint nomination for the Mombasa governor race. In Mombasa, all parties in Cord will front their respective candidates. There will be no special treatment for any candidate, Awiti said. The positions of governor, senator, MPs, woman representative and MCAs are open for all members and I want to assure you there will be no handpicking of candidates because we are democratic. He said the Mombasa tour will mark the beginning of Wiper s nationwide campaigns. ODM has already started its countrywide campaigns. Awiti spoke on Saturday when he opened the second Wiper office in Likoni.He criticised the county administration for increasing levies on tourism. This forces hotels to increase their fees, making them very expensive, the legislator said.Awiti criticised the county for plans to charge religious organisations Sh25,000 for hiring grounds for functions. These are nonprofit organisations that play an important role in bringing about harmony and unity among residents. They need not be levied, he said. Awiti asked the county assembly to explain why it allocated Sh129 million to equip the governor s office. This is exorbitant and misuse of public funds, especially when it is very clear that there are many important services that need to be carried out by the county for the people, he said.
