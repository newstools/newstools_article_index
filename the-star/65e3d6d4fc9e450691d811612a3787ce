Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and Deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke on Friday met Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka at his Karen home to craft a strategy for next year's parliamentary and county assembly nominations.The leaders discussed a formula to ensure ODM and Wiper do not compete during elections, which would divide supporters and give victory to competitors."We wanted to tell him [Kalonzo] that we must remain united. We must field a single candidate in every elective zone. We are seeking his support in ensuring the unity of the coalition," Mueke told the Star on the phone.Kidero (ODM) and Mueke (Wiper) are senior members of their respective parties in Nairobi. The two were irked by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho's "six piace" voting style. Joho is ODM deputy party leader and it is not clear whether he meant six piece for ODM or Cord."Joho said we should have a "six piece" voting pattern. What about the other parties and their members? We moved fast before it goes too far," Mueke said.
