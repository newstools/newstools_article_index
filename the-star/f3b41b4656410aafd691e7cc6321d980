Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has retracted his decision to join Jubilee Party saying he is neither interested in the ruling coalition nor the opposition's Cord.Timamy told residents at Mwana Arafa Hotel in Lamu on Monday that he has opted for Musalia Mudavadi s Amani National Coalition."Those who had already started bragging of owning Jubilee Party can now rest easy since I have left their party for them, and I am really glad I did," he said."I want to belong to a party that respects its members and where they have equal regard for each other. I thank God ANC provides just that."The Governor left UDF, the party under whose ticket he was elected in 2013, for JP about two months ago.Timamy said Jubilee and Cord were overpopulated and marred with too much infighting, which he said he wasn t willing to be party to.He praised Mudavadi saying the Amani leader has been his political leader and mentor since he got into politics.He added that it was only wise to stick with him and defend his seat in the next election on the party's ticket.[VIDEO] Jubilee to receive five Cord governors , 35 MPs on SaturdayRead: Has Jubilee finally outsmarted ODM/Cord?Timamy further said Jubilee and Cord have "successfully planted hate and enmity among politicians in other parties instead of uniting Kenyans.He said he was not willing to be part of a party that will ruin the future of Kenyans."You can already see the scramble for nominations for various positions in Jubilee and Cord. It seems that is the reason all these people want to belong to those parties," he said."While I thought the grand merger would be different, I am surprised. That is why I would rather stick with ANC. I hate chaos you know,."During DP William Ruto s visit to Lamu in August, local politician Fahim Twaha warned Timamy who had announced his intention to join JP.Saying the party had owners, Twaha asked Timamy to be ready to adhere to that.The Governor will face competition on August 8, 2017 from politicians including lawyer Waihiga Mwaure, former KPA board member Abdalla Fadhil and Twaha, who is his long-term political foe.
