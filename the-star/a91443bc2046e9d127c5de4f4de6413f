Jubilee politicians Ramadhan Kajembe and Suleiman Shahbal have begun their onslaught against Governor Hassan Joho and ODM to counter Orange party s dominion over Mombasa.Jubilee insiders say the party has tasked its Coast brigade with specific targets and each person given a particular area, as was the case during the March 7 Malindi by-election. The duo has been tasked with spearheading campaigns.Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung aro has been tasked with turning Kilifi county red, while Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya will team up with Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani to woo residents to Jubilee.Governor Hussein Dado will lead the Jubilee campaign in Tana River, while Governor Issa Timamy will lead the onslaught in Lamu. On Sunday, Shahbal and Kajembe urged Changamwe residents to vote for Jubilee and elect Shahbal governor.Kajembe branded ODM a bunch of liars with nothing to offer. I urge you to vote for the Jubilee Party. Your governor-in-waiting is Suleiman Shabal, he told the congregation at the Jesus Winning Souls Ministry.Kajembe and Shahbal are to counter claims by Joho the Jubilee administration is sabotaging the county economically by planning to shift many functions of the Port of Mombasa to Naivasha, in Nakuru county. This has not been confirmed. Kajembe told the Star on Thursday the claims are untrue. I cannot talk of things I am not sure of. We must confirm the truth of the matter first, before we tell Mombasa residents what s happening. Some people just want to get political mileage, he said.Shahbal criticised the county for charging religious groups for meetings held in public places. The Mombasa county assembly passed a motion proposing charges of up to Sh25,000 for religious gatherings and crusades in public areas. He said this is unacceptable.
