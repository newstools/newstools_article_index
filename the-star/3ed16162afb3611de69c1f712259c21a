Some 45 per cent of women aged 15 to 49 years have experienced physical violence, according to the latest Kenya Demographic Health Survey. The survey found that 40 per cent of women who were once married had experienced physical or sexual violence by their spouse. The Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender, in conjunction with the Inter Religious Council of Kenya, yesterday held talks on how to partner to reduce sexual and gender-based violence at grassroot levels. Progress for women is progress for girls, Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs CS Sicily Kariuki said. The State Department of Gender Affairs Principal Secretary Zeinab Hussein said the ministry and government would collaborate to involve women in leadership, enhance peace and security and deal with GBV. CS Kariuki thanked the Inter-Religious Council leaders for taking the lead in the campaign against gender violence.
