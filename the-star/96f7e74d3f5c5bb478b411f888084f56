Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery has asked two Kisii MCAs to apologise after they were found with three schoolgirls.During a press conference on Tuesday, Nkaissery said: "the police are aware of the Kisii MCAs found with three high school girls. They should apologise or be arrested."The two were arrested on Monday at Nyamarambe after they were found with three secondary schoolgirls.Joash Orora (Masimba) and Cosmas Saka (Nyakoe) were spotted with the Induru Girls' students by a driver who plies the route.The girls were seen in a vehicle changing from civilian clothes to their school uniforms. It is alleged they spent the weekend with the MCAs.County criminal investigation officer Justus Burudi said on Tuesday that the MCAs will continue to be in custody until police complete investigations.He said the girls were taken to Kisii teaching and Referral Hospital for medical examinations."The MCAs will be arraigned immediately after police complete probing the matter," he added.Kisii woman rep Mary Otara condemned the incident, saying legal action should be taken against the two leaders.Otara said leaders who are charged with the responsibility of protecting children's rights cannot turn around and violate the same. She urged women to come out in large numbers to castigate the same.She singled out a recent incident where another MCA from the region slapped a nurse at health facility claiming that she took longer to attend to a patient he had escorted there. It is very shameful for leaders who are supposed to protect children rights to have carnal knowledge of underage girls. We must all stand and condemn the same, Otara said.The woman rep said that rights of children must be protected at all costs, adding that education of girls must be given priority.Read: Man who raped class four pupil, posted photos on Facebook arrested in Sotik
