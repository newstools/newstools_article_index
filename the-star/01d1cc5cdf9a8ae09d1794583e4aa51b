Kile ambacho unajua utapeana kwa hao watu huko bunge ambacho hakikuhusu na kinahusu wengine wacha kisifike kwa hao watu."If hiyo information itafikia hao watu itabidi kitu kifanywe na hata kama unafikiri watakuprotect tunajua corner zote ambazo tutapata wapendwa wako. We will do what we have to do. Asante."This loosely translates to: "Ben, come Tuesday we will be watching you very keenly. Whatever you have that you will give to those people at Parliament, that does not concern you but concerns others, should not reach them."If the information reaches them something will have to be done. You might think they will protect you but we know all the corners where your loved ones can be found."Read: I am victim of office politics in Sh791 million NYS scandal, Ben Gethi tells PACAlso read: Gethi admits inflating prices of NYS fuel during PAC probeGethi told the PAC last Tuesday that he had details of communication between investigators and former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru that implicated them in tampering with investigations.He made reference to bank deposit slips in questioning his selective prosecution, arguing he expected all the beneficiaries to be charged.Gethi is expected to give more details of all the contracts he and his companies entered with the NYS and the Devolution ministry.He is also to give certified bank statements of his personal accounts and business accounts capturing all NYS payments.The businessman alleged that that the former CS had tampered with documents to implicate hi.He further claimed documents produced by former NYS deputy director general Adan Harakhe were changed to conceal the truth.Gethi dismissed claims by former Harakhe that he stopped funds to NYS in the IFMIS system."I do not understand how my name was roped into the Sh791 million saga monies that Harakhe confirms to have successfully reversed," he said.More on this: Ben Gethi: Waiguru fixed me over NYS
