A 13-year-old boy who had been feared dead was found in jail after a month-long search.Thika subcounty deputy children s officer Lina Mwangi on Monday said the boy was taken to the Thika law courts after police found him on the streets.Mwangi said the court ruled that he be placed in a children s home as they look for his family. He first told us he was from Githurai but when I took him there I noticed none of the children recognised him, she said.The boy s mother said she separated from her husband in Embu, and that may have affected the boy, prompting him to run away. We shouldn t blame the child. Some have difficulty expressing themselves and may end up being misunderstood as delinquents. The child may be acting out and without proper guidance may end up behind bars, Mwangi said.
