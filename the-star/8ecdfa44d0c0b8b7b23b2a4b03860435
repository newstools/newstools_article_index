Governor Nathif Jama has blamed officers from the defunct Transitional Authority for being behind the financial and procurement irregularities in Garissa county, during his first year in office.The governor yesterday said the officials were not cooperative before their exit. He appeared for the second time before the Senate Public Accounts Committee yesterday to respond to audit queries raised from the counties 2013-14 budget. The Transition Authority did not form an audit team before they left . The audit queries arose during my first year in office because the staff were not helpful. They even left without handing over, Nathif said.Auditor General Edward Ouko had questioned why the county single-sourced a chartered aircraft to ferry the governor and other leaders from Nairobi to six Garissa subcounties and back to the city. Ouko said despite the county paying Sh1,578,100 for the service, there was no programme to support and confirm the governor s visit to the subcounties. Our first year in office was a difficult year. Some of the documents were not in the right place and could not be found when the auditors came, but we found them later, the governor said.Nathif failed to furnish the committee with proof of their visit, only saying Senator Yusuf Hajji was in the team that travelled. He urged the committee to confirm with Hajji. He is your colleague, you can easily confirm if, indeed, we were ferried to the destinations, the county boss said.However, West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo, who chaired the session, directed Nathif to get evidence from the airline they used. You will have to get this committee the manifest with the names. It s a public document, go and request for it, Lonyangapuo said.
