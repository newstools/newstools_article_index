Karatina University has launched a programme to teach pupils environment conservation by planting more trees through environmental clubs.Deputy vice chancellor Peninah Aloo said 25 clubs have been formed in schools within Nyeri county. The initiative will soon be rolled out in other counties, she said on Friday.Speaking at Munaini Primary School, Othaya, Aloo criticised the high exploitation of forests, which threatens wildlife.She said the programme has received more than Sh750,000 from Rufford Foundation to ensure more trees are planted. We aim to work with pupils because if we train them to plant trees at a young age, they will grow with those values, Aloo said. The programme will ensure forest cover reaches 10 per cent from the current seven per cent, the DVC said. Lack of trees has led to hunger and drought, Aloo said.She said the university will set up botanical gardens to raise awareness of environment education among the youth.The don urged the government to ensure all Kenyans plant trees to mark the International Day of Forests every March 21. If every Kenyan plants a tree we shall have more than 40 million trees planted in a single day. In 10 years we shall have more than 400 million new trees and Kenya will be a better place, Aloo said.She attributed to poverty the massive destruction of forests, which lead to human-wildlife conflicts.
