The Kenya Bankers Association, the banking industry lobby, yesterday said it is not aware of increased charges on accounts without regulatory approval.Chief executive Habil Olaka said no new charges nor changes have been made on existing products, contrary to complaints from customers to the regulator, the Central Bank. These charges have been there. It is only that when customers see them now, they think they are new, Olaka said. He said no new charges can be introduced without the approval of the CBK. It is a requirement when one needs to come up with a new charge or changes on products they must get the CBK approval, and that is what banks have been doing, Olaka said. He was responding to queries from the circular issued by CBK on Monday to chief executives.CBK governor Patrick Njoroge said the regulator is investigating complaints from customers that some crafty banks have increased transactional charges in the wake of profit margins pressures after loan charges were capped at 14 per cent on September 20.Others have converted savings into current accounts to avoid paying the seven per cent minimum returns on term deposits. Since the Banking (Amendment) Act 2016 came into force on September 14, 2016, the Central Bank of Kenya has received some applications from institutions seeking approvals to increase charges on their products, Njoroge said in the Circular No. 6 of 2016 on Monday.
