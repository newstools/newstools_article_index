A Lake Victoria South Water Services Board director is the latest entrant in the race for the Siaya woman representative.Violet Omwamba said she will vie on the Jubilee Party ticket. She said her aim is to transform women s lives in Siaya. Omwamba ran for the same position in 2013 on a TNA ticket and only garnered 4,000 votes.She said her leadership will be pegged to development initiatives. I am confident President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto will win the elections, Omwamba said She said residents need to know that woman representatives have been allocated funds but nothing is on the ground to show how the money has been used.Only two women have declared interest to unseat Christine Ombaka (pictured). They are Florence Aluodo and Omwamba.
