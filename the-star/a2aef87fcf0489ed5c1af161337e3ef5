The electoral agency will revise its 2017 roadmap following the enactment of the negotiated electoral laws.However, IEBC communications manager Andrew Limo said the commission is still holding consultative meetings with key stakeholders. Although the Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2016, which came into force on October 4, 2016, will require some adjustments to the schedule of activities, the commission has not released new timelines for the August 2017 General Election, he said yesterday. This is still a work in progress and we should be able to formally release a revised election roadmap in due course .The new law sets rigid requirements and shorter timelines, effectively messing up the initial IEBC calendar for the August 8, 2017 polls.For instance, the new law makes it mandatory for an integrated electronic electoral system.This means biometric voter registration kits, electronic voter identification kits and the results transmission system must be integrated. The technology, specifically EVID, has not been acquired 10 months to the polls.The law requires all technology be procured eight months to the polls.The electoral agency yet to get new commissioners 10 months to the poll says the timelines in the law are not feasible and warns the legislation to have far-reaching implications on the management of elections .The major challenge will be around managing the acquisition and implementation of technology, it says.
