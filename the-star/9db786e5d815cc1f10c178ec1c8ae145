This should be condemned as it shows political competition is enmity," he said."Uhuru has consistently told Ralla to respect the presidency... It is time leaders respected one another for peace and harmony to prevail in Kenya."Caucus secretary general Stephen Karanja said Cord leaders should desist from insulting the president and learn to politick maturely."As youths we are angered whenever the President is insulted by the opposition. This incident showed how immature the leaders are," he said.The youths said politicians should set examples by respecting each other, and not promote divisive politics."When leaders do not respect each other it only means there will be chaos. We should not let ourselves be divided; we should embrace unity," said Karanja.The caucus asked the President to ensure development and unity.
