The National Assembly s Legal Affairs Committee has nine days to vet Chief Justice nominee David Maraga. Speaker Justin Muturi said the vetting and approving process should be expedited, since there is a vacuum of leadership at the judiciary. The committee should notify the nominee and the general public of the time and place for holding the approval hearings expeditiously, he said The notification should therefore be made immediately and the Committee should thereafter commence the necessary approval hearings and table its report on or before Wednesday. On Sunday, State House said President Uhuru Kenyatta had forwarded the name of Maraga to Parliament for vetting. Maraga was nominated by the Judicial Service Commission and his name was forwarded to President last week.
