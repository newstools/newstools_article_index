Lake Victoria fishermen are now using mobile telephony to share information on fish prices and to send alerts about the state of the lake at any given time. Lake Victoria is Africa's largest by surface area. Lake Victoria Basin Commission executive secretary Ally-Said Matano said: Around Lake Victoria, fishermen are seamlessly exchanging short messages on how stormy or calm the lake is, and fishermen are sharing information via telephone about the day's fish prices. Speaking at a Nairobi hotel during a knowledge management workshop, Matano said smartphones are increasingly being used to start global conversations on topical issues in conservation, health, education, agriculture, water resources management among others. Some apps like WhatsApp have narrowed the knowledge gaps between people and communities, he said.
