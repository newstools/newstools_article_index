An MP has asked Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi to stop lecturing Luhya leaders who defected to Jubilee and concentrate on his party's affairs.Navakholo's Emmanuel Wangwe said he and other Western leaders moved from UDF, that Mudavadi once headed, by choice.Wangwe told the Star by phone on Wednesday that UDF defectors and those who moved from New Ford Kenya were in Jubilee Party to stay. Mudavadi is my friend and we respect him. He should however stop issuing ultimatums for us to declare which parties we want to belong to after the merger, he said. He should know I am his potential voter and convince me to join his party because we still have a long time to the elections. What he is telling us is in law and we know it. He should stop burning bridges."Underlining it was wrong for Mudavadi to refer to the defectors as Judas Iscariot , he said his people helped him make the decision to move to Jubilee.Read: UDF in 2016 'exodus' to Mudavadi's partyAlso read: The road To 2017: Hurdles Musalia Mudavadi must overcomeSeveral parties folded up ahead of the launch of JP, which is headed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.Mudavadi told a rally in Mumias East on Sunday that elected leaders whose parties folded had until Sunday to notify the registrar of political parties of their new outfits or confirm Jubilee membership.He asked them to join Amani National Coalition and avoid the last minute rush ahead of the August 2017 poll, as Jubilee was a "hoax".Mudavadi has asked voters to reject the defectors if they dared stand on Jubilee tickets in 2017.They inlcude Wangwe and MPs Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), Ben Washiali (Mumias East), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Boniface Otsiula (Bumula).Others are Bungoma Governor Kenmeth Lusaka and county woman representative Reginalda Wanyonyi.
