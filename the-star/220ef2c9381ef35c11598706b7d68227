According to the complaint lodged by KPL, the incident involved Leopards fans entering the field of play and assaulting Rangers goalkeeper Matasi.

The committee has instructed Leopards to pay the amount within 30 days failure to which the Kenyan Premier League will recover the money from the club s monthly grants.The ruling further stated: As the IDCC has observed in previous determinations, all clubs participating in tournaments organised by the KPL must understand that the KPL doesn t condone any acts of hooliganism. In this respect, all clubs must observe the KPL s Zero Tolerance Policy on Abandoned Matches and Assaults, which states that A Club is responsible for the conduct of its officials, players and fans and will be held responsible for any assault on any person immediately before, during or after a match, the ruling concluded.IDCC, however, found no evidence on the charge of AFC Leopards fans being involved in skirmishes at the stands during the match.
