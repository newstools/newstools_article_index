Four men arraigned over links to terror group ISIS were released unconditionally on Friday after the prosecution failed to press charges against them.Ali Musa, Hamisi Hakim, Yasin Ahmed and Mwinyi Mwabondo had been detained for seven days amid investigations into the claim against them.State prosecutor Lydia Kagori told the court to discharge them as police had failed to find any evidence that they were members of the terror group.But Kagori asked chief magistrate Julius Nange'a to allow police to detain Mwabondo longer. She noted his phone, which was handed over to the Cyber Crime Unit, was being analysed after suspicious information was found on it.Nange'a did not grant this request but asked the suspect to report to Diani police station in Ukunda every Tuesday for the next three weeks.The suspects were arrested on October 7 at Mombasa courts after attending a relative's trial.It had been said that they were planning to carry out terrorist attacks at unspecified areas in Mombasa and Kwale counties.More on this: Four suspected ISIS terrorists detained three days
