Politicians from counties where Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is practiced have been urged to support Anti-FGM campaigns without fear of losing votes in election.While speaking at a girl s rescue center in Loosuk area, Samburu on Tuesday, Samburu girls Foundation Founder and Director Dr Josephine Kulea said politicians from Samburu County have never attended anti-FGM events in the region for fear of losing votes in election.Kulea accused the leaders for declaring the war against FGM and early marriages while in seminars and workshops in Nairobi but fail to do so back home.She challenged the leaders to lead their communities in a manner they will progress well with others towards attainable goals in development of the country by fighting FGM.However, according to a research scientist and lecturer, Dr Tammary Esho, FGM prevalence is very high in Samburu community at 86 per cent after Somali which is at 94 per cent.She said traditions of Samburu community are very conservative as people subject their daughters aged between 9 to 15 years to FGM for various reasons such as marriages. FGM and early marriages have been passed by time and if we don t have political goodwill in the fight against them we will continue to lag behind other communities in terms of health, education and general development. She said. That is why we have child marriage in Samburu because once a girl undergoes FGM she is married immediately .The community views FGM as a stepping stone to marriage, Ms Esho said.She said the harmful cultural practice which comes hand in hand with early marriages and pregnancies have forced many girls to drop out of school.She added that other communities with high FGM prevalence are the Kisii with 84 percent, Maasai 77 percent while the Kalenjin and Kikuyu are below 30 percent.However, Esho noted there is a decline in FGM prevalence in the country in the last ten years due to concerted efforts by the national government and NGOs such as the Samburu Girls Foundation. In 2003 we had a countrywide FGM prevalence of 38 percent in 2008 it reduced to 27 percent and now it is at 21 percent and we are hopeful that it will be below 1 percent by 2030. She said.Dr Kulea told over 2000 residents who turned up to commemorate the event that there is higher mortality rate and malnutrition in Samburu County because many women are married at an early age after undergoing FGM.Some of the young girls rescued from FGM and early marriages that are pursuing their education in universities and secondary schools were also invited to encourage others.The chief guest was a 12 year-old-girl learning in standard six at a local primary school after she was rescued from her parents planned forced early marriage while aged nine years.The bright girl who is an elected governor in her school and speaker for Samburu children assembly seeks to arm herself with university education, get a job and come back to help less privileged in her community.Children from various schools asked the community to give them a chance to pursue their education through their entertainment presentations that ranged from poems, choirs and drama.
