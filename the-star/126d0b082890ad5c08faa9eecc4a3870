Some Nairobi MCAs have accused Governor Evans Kidero of not implementing bills, motions and petitions sent to him.Speaking at a city hotel, they said the assembly has passed 23 bills since since 2013, but only Finance bills have been assented to.The MCas were led by Jubilee's Kamau Thuo of Karura. Cord MCAs said "nothing has been implemented" but they fear speaking out openly because they expect Kidero to fund their campaigns."We risk losing our seats because very little has been done. But the governor is our friend and we don't want him to victimise us," said a Cord MCA.Thuo said despite the assembly passing the motion to rename Limuru Road Wangari Maathai Road, the executive refused to do with no explanation.The motion was passed in October last year.Tabling the motion, Thuo said Maathai s passion and tireless efforts in conserving the environment should be recognised by renaming the road after her.
