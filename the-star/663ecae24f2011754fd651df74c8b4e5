The pilots association has called off the planned strike after meeting with stakeholders.According to sources, Kalpa met with government stakeholders and Kenya Airways management before the decision was reached.Kenya Airways on Sunday cancelled several flights after some crew members failed to turn up for work."Some of our outsourced staff, including cabin crew, have stayed away from work from Friday and we are working with their employer to resolve any issues they may have," the airline said in a statement.Flights cancelled included Mombasa, Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Juba in South Sudan, Lusaka in Zambia, Harare in Zimbabwe and Maputo in Mozambique.Kenya Airways later said that normal service had resumed but offered no further details.On Friday, a court ruled the strike was illegal and the government had said it would be "economic sabotage".Earlier, the government asked the pilots union to call off a planned strike at flag carrier Kenya Airways due to start on October 18.Transport CS James Macharia said Kalpa overstepped its mandate and that the strike will cause widespread economic and national disruption.Kalpa issued a seven-day strike notice for an overhaul of the KQ management team, following yet another case of a flight delay. A Kenya Airways flight from Lusaka was delayed by technical hitches.More on this: Pilots issue seven-day strike notice after another KQ flight delayAlso read: KQ threatens to stop selling tickets over 'unjustified' Kalpa strike notice
