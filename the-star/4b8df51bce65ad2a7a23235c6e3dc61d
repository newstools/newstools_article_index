The Lake Victoria Basin Commission yesterday began talks with the African Development Bank on a security project. The aim of the Multinational Maritime, Communication and Transport project is to improve safety on Lake Victoria. The LVBC executive secretary Ally-Said Matano said the project will reduce accidents and ensure the lake is used sustainably for transportation and other socioeconomic activities. It is my prayer that delegates from East Africa Community partner states will apply a common approach while negotiating with AfDB, he said yesterday. We want improve navigation, transport and communication. By so doing, we are respecting the integrity of 40 million people living in the Lake Victoria Basin.
