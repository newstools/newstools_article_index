Machakos Directorate of Criminal Investigations officers have taken over investigations into the murder of a patient in Mwingi Level 4 Hospital. Fredrick Ngandi was pumped with bullets by unknown assailants on Thursday.Mwingi East subcounty DCIO Godwin Masinde, who is also acting for Mwingi Central subcounty s boss James Manuni who is on leave, told the press he is no longer handling the case. He directed the media to his seniors for information.Ngandi was taken to hospital from Ukasi by police. He had been shot six times. The officers left him despite his pleas that the attackers might come after him. Kenya National Union of Nurses official Ken Mwangi Muriuki said patients with gunshot wounds should be under protection at all times. He said it was wrong that the deceased was left alone without any security. I am just trying to imagine what could have happened if the nurse on duty was seen by the assailants. This case seems to be a conspiracy because I don t understand why the patient was abandoned, Mwangi said. Ngandi s sister said he was hijacked, blindfolded and driven from Kitui to Ukasi where he was shot five times in the head and his spinal cord. He was later sprayed with more bullets at Mwingi Level 4 Hospital where he was killed in the presence of his older sister and her friend.
