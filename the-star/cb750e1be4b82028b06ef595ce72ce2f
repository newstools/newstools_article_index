Former Olympic youth 3,000m champion Gladys Chesir will be chasing top honours in her fifth half marathon appearance when she lines up for the Copenhagen 21-km race on Sunday.With a 66.57 personal best posted at the RAK half marathon this year, Chesir leads an elite field that also includes fellow Kenyans Rose Chelimo (68.08), Pauline Wanjiku (69.06) and Asefa Kebede (68.23) and Gulena Imana (68.45) of Ethiopia. Having finished sixth at the World Half Marathon this year, Chesir who trains in Iten, is confident of a better performance in Copenhagen. My intention is to do well there although the field is competitive, Chesir said. Chesir failed to make a cut in the 10,000m women s team for Rio Olympics during the national trials in Eldoret afterplacing third. I had the intention of representing Kenya in Olympics but I didn t make the team. That s is why I embarked on the preparations for the Copenhagen race, she said.She made her half marathon debut in 2014 in China. In the men s category, defending champion Bedan Karoki will also line up for his second title on the course.Koroki who clocked a personal best of 59.14 to win the race last year will be up against Chicago Marathon winner Sammy Kitwara this time round.Meanwhile had it not been for the prospects of becoming a distance runner, Julius Arile Lamerinyang might well have met the fate that has befallen many of his friends: death by gunfire.From his early teens, Arile carried a gun and, together with his fellow "warriors", raided neighbouring communities in the highlands of northern Kenya, stealing their cattle. It was the only life he knew. During that time, he reckons as many as 20 of his friends were shot dead.On October 16, Arile will be among the elite runners to toe the line at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon, an IAAF Gold Label Race.
