Highly-acclaimed play Nzilani by thespian Elsaphan Njora is back. The play takes the audience back along his journey through life, including the highs and the lows; the beaten paths and the twists in the road; the major milestones and the little things. According to Elsaphan, the journey will make you laugh, remind you of a past, make you cry and make you think. He does this through poetry, drama, dance and music.It's the third show he is staging this year with direction from June Gachui.The play, which will be staged at the Kenya National Theatre in Nairobi on September 17, features Kendi Nkonge, Tim Nightway, Charity Nyambura and Brian Ogola. The witty thespian says that, through his poetry from his 51-piece anthology set for publishing this November, he is on a mission to raise a generation that will aspire "to do" and not just "sit and watch". "Nzilani will not leave you the same," he states.
