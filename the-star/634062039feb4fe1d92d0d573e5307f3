The Akorino faithful in Nyandarua have said they support Governor Daniel Waithaka because he has performed well, but they will decide whether to reelect him. As a church, we support the leadership of the day. But we are praying to God to reveal to us the leader we shall back, Samuel Kinyanjui said on Sunday.He is the Nyandarua branch secretary general. He said followers will only support a leader who is development-oriented, in touch with the populace, and able to address problems of health, security, education and roads.Kinyanjui also said the Akorino will only back Jubilee Party members because the Jubilee Party has been anointed by God. Jubilee is from heaven, a celebration of unity, he said.The church coordinator in Nyandarua James Ikinu said there are more than 10,000 Akorino voters in the county. Whoever we back will have an unrivalled advantage, he told the Star.They also back Nyandarua woman representative Wanjiku Muhia. She has captured our hearts, a member said.
