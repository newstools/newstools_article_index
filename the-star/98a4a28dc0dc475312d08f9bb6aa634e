Nairobi County is planning a network of cycling lanes and footpaths alongside the main roads to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians.The consultant drafting the policy, Tom Opiyo said once implemented it will help in creating a safe, cohesive and comfortable network of footpaths, cycling lanes and tracks, green areas and other support amenities.The policy - Nairobi Streets and Roads Design Manual- outlines master plans for pedestrian, cyclists and human-drawn carts and developing and maintaining infrastructure for the same. Nairobi transport system is basically road-based, and more oriented to private car use. Safety of pedestrians is a major challenge and account for 70 per cent of fatalities in the city, Opiyo said NMT infrastructure is generally lacking, in poor state, isolated and poorly designed. The policy will improve safety for all users by minimising conflict. Opiyo spoke at a stakeholders meeting on NMT at a Nairobi hotel on Thursday.He called for passing of by-laws to enable proper planning, effective enforcement, adequate funding and effective land use planning and control.Opiyo cited encroachment into NMT spaces by motorists and motorcyclists; parking, hawkers and weak enforcement of traffic laws on NMT facilities as the major causes for the situation that has put the pedestrian and human-drawn carts in danger.He said the policy will put in place laws and regulations to ensure that NMT facilities and areas are not encroached by the motorised locomotives and other street users. In Nairobi, 60 per cent residents move from one place to another by walking or cycling, Opiyo said.He said availing facilities for the two groups will increase mobility and accessibility and improve transport safety.Opiyo said implementation of the policy will also raise awareness and change attitude towards NMT in Nairobi County.He asked the county to set aside adequate resources for development and maintenance of NMT infrastructure.Opiyo said lack of policy implementation continues to frustrate provision of a balanced transport system that includes NMT provisions. Lack of parking facilities for bicycles and transfer to motorised transport for cyclists is difficult because there are no provisions for storage in urban public transport, Opiyo said. He said lack of parking spaces discourages cyclists.(+)Nairobi City County Government in collaboration with The Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations and United Nations Environment Programme developed a Non Motorized Transport (NMT) Policy for the capital city. The objective of the policy is to ensure harmonisation, prioritisation and coordination of NMT facility development and maintenance in Nairobi.
