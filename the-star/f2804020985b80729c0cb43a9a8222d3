When the officers questioned why he was taking pictures he said, I am on duty like you .Two APs grabbed his camera and chased him away.When the contractors saw journalists being roughed up they heckled the officers for interfering with press freedom.The APs attempted to stop the contractors from addressing the journalists but were repulsed.
