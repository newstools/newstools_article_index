Women account for 82 per cent of total savings in Kenya, according to Central Bank of Kenya data.CBK governor Patrick Njoroge further placed the number of transactions associated with women's bank accounts at 58 per cent. The data shows the previously marginalised group now dominates the country's large integrated banking and payments platforms in the country. Kenya now has a relatively small gender gap of about seven per cent," the governor said."The Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) study attributes the small gender gap to the success of mobile money, which provides women and their families a distinct reason to own and use a mobile phone."Njoroge noted the study ranked Kenya s women among the most connected in the world.He added that targeting women will not only advance their digital and financial inclusion but also deliver significant socio-economic benefits to families and households.But despite the small gender gap, he said, the GSMA study showed there was a sizeable gap in mobile phone ownership and usage in low and middle-income countries. There is evidence to suggest that women in t(some) countries are on average 14 per cent less likely to own a mobile phone than men," he said. "For instance, gender gaps in Mexico and Egypt are at six per cent and two per cent respectively, and reported at 41 per cent in Niger and 21 per cent in Jordan. The governor said the Kenyan government will continue to advocate for saving by setting up incentives and attractive financial services through mobile banking. Kenya will allow the public to purchase government securities through their mobile phone money transfer services, with a minimum investment amount of US$30 (Sh3,000)," he said.Njoroge addressed the 4th Edition of the Dutch Development Bank (FMO) Future of Finance conference in Noordwijk, Netherlands.
