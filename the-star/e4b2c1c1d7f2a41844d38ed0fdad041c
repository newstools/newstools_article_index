More than half of Kenyans are dissatisfied with the direction Kenya is headed in regard to corruption and the economy, a new survey indicates.The survey, by research firm Twaweza East Africa, indicates that 53 per cent of Kenyans are dissatisfied with the direction Kenya is headed in regard to graft.Another 52 per cent are dissatisfied with the direction the country is headed in terms of the economy.The grim statistics appear to be an indictment of the Jubilee administration as President Uhuru Kenyatta today hosts the Governance and Accountability Summit at State House, Nairobi. When asked how satisfied they are with the direction the country is headed in four key areas of governance, more than half responded that they were dissatisfied with corruption in government, Twaweza said in a press statement yesterday.Big money scandals have rocked Jubilee since 2013 and prompted Uhuru to crack the anti-graft whip, sacking five Cabinet Secretaries and tens of top state officers in November last year. Among the scandals include the Sh1.8 billion National Youth Service scam.On Sunday, Cord leader Raila Odinga warned against granting another sovereign loan to Kenya until it fully accounts for the Sh250 billion issued in 2014. The inability by the government to account for expenditures of the Eurobond places Kenya at the risk of sovereign default, Raila warned.The opposition chief and a host of civil society actors, including David Ndii, have insisted Jubilee cannot account for the Eurobond loan.All the three arms of government the executive, judiciary and the legislature as well as constitutional commissions are expected to participate in today s summit. State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu said anti-graft crusaders Ndii and John Githongo are among those invited for the summit. This is not the space for chest-thumping and finger-pointing, Esipisu said. It is a space where only facts will be required and where Kenyans expect to see answers on the way forward in terms of the battle against graft and other lack of integrity-related vices .
