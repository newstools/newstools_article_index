Lugari MP Ayub Savula has asked Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula to drop his presidential bid in favour of Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi.The MP said Mudavadi was the most experienced politician from western, capable of taking on President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto in the August 8, 2017 poll."When you compare Mudavadi and Wetang'ula you find the Senator has only served as a minister while the former has served as a minister and vice president," Savula said.Savula said the Amani leader has a grasp of the requirements for public service therefore can effectively manage the country and fight corruption.He also said Mudavadi has a good image which makes it easier for him to work closely with all the 42 tribes in the country.Read: Mudavadi urged to back Wetang'ula bidAlso read: Mudavadi, Wetang'ula urged to drop presidential bids, back Uhuru or RailaSavula went on to say that Mudavadi can marshal financial resources to fund a presidential campaign, and is better placed to seek the support of other regions.He questioned Wetang'ula's capability to fund campaigns for the presidency."If you compare resources you find Wetang'ula cannot stage a strong presidential campaign. Mudavadi has the energy and resources. He did it in 2013," the MP said.Read: Wetang ula in fix as Luyhas front Mudavadi The lawmaker said it would also be easier for Mudavadi to campaign in the coming elections as western registered more than two million votes to be among the country's top three voting blocs."We have done enough civic education and voter registration. We will be looking at more than 3.5 million votes from the region before the next election. Let us solidify our votes and put personal interests aside for the community and the country," he said.Savula said most regions that gained from the government voted as a bloc and ended up with strong bargaining power at the national level."Look at URP and TNA strongholds... Let us vote as a bloc so that after elections we are strong and have a strong stake in the government so as to push our interests," he said.The Lugari legislator said voters will be interested in people who address issues and those who have been in touch with them.
