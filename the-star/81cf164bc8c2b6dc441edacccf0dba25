Local and international journalists meeting in Nairobi yesterday praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for assenting to the Access to Information Bill.The Act aims to put to rest the issue of government departments withholding information from the public they viewed as secrets . The journalists drawn from Norway and Kenya mostly handling investigative stories on land and human rights, said the right to access information held by public agencies is a fundamental human right.Participants said such rights were for a long time inhibited by other legislative provisions. The conference was organised by Article 19 and the NORSK Pressforbund in collaboration with the Norwegian Press Association.Legal experts drawn from NGOs and government told journalists they can now seek information on how many Kenya Defence Forces soldiers were killed early in the year when al Shabaab militants raided their camp in El Adde, Somalia. The government has not released the number of soldiers who died. Sandra Musoga of Article 19 and Simon Nzioka from the Ombudsman said the new law will also benefit Kenyans seeking information held by government agencies. Nzioka, however, said individual entities are guaranteed by the same laws to seek such information and not as corporate entities. This means that media houses seeking such information cannot be granted access unless they use individual journalists to seek it.
