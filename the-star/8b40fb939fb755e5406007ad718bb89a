Shots have been fired people!The 'beef' between Kenyan rappers Kenrazy and Majirani has been revived.This is after the latter blasted the Mbilikimo Mkora hit rapper for consistently "lying" that mega hit jam Hivo Ndio Kunaendaga was his song.According to Majirani, he paid Kenrazy to "drop" a verse in the song (which he claims he wrote) but Kenrazy made it his by stating that he had composed it.The remarks were made following Kenrazy's post on his social media post where he said that he was paid Sh20,000 by Majirani to do a verse for the song.He added that the amount was the least he's ever charged to feature in a collabo."Kwa zile collabo zote nimewai fanya, Hivo Ndio Kunaendaga ndio collabo ile nilicharge pesa kidogo sana kuweka verse. Ksh.20,000 na I've never regretted kwa sababu it became one of the biggest song I have ever been part of. (In all the collaborations I've done, I charged the least for Hivo Ndio Kunaendaga. I charged Sh20,000 but I've never regretted.)"Majirani was quick to respond, blasting Kenrazy by telling him that his time in music was up and that he should quit and start managing his baby mama (Sosuun) who is also a rapper.He said partly in a statement: "...stop acting expensive, stop acting holy. I lost my respect for you when you went to Churchill Show and lied that you wrote my song. A song I wrote while in prison."He continued, "...I worked hard to get money and pay you for a collabo only for you to steal it"Tell us which upcoming artiste in your entire career did you ever introduce to us, apart from using them to insult Majirani?"...you started off way back in 2005 we are in 2016 and you are still complaining of not making money. When will you start making money?"My advice to you is quit music and manage your girlfriend. She has a brighter future in the music game."We contacted Kenrazy, who said that he was in a radio interview and that he would make contact as soon as he was done.However, he hadn't responded by the time this piece was published.
