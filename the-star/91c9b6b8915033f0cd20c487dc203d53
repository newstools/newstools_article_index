A teenager who shot dead a police informer three years ago will be detained at the President's mercy, an indefinite jail sentence.Ali Hassan alias Wako committed the murder when he was 15 years old. He was found guilty on Friday by High Court judge Jessie Lesiit .The judge said the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Wako shot Isaya Ernest Alube on December 21, 2012 at Kiamaiko area in Nairobi's Huruma estate.While handing the sentence, the judge said her decision to leave the teenager at the mercy of the president was reached after considering the Children's Act, the sentencing guidelines policy and the penalty for murder."You (to Wako) shot Alube at point blank range in retaliation because he had reported you and your accomplices to the police for criminal activities, that was cold blood murder," the judge said.When analysing the facts of the case, Justice Lessit said Alube was in the company of two undercover police officers who were after notorious criminals.The criminal gang, according to the judge, was terrorising pedestrians within Kiamaiko area and Alube had volunteered to identify them.When Alube, who was walking a few steps ahead of the officers pointed at them, Wako removed a gun from his pocket and shot him.The officers who testified against the teenager told court that they heard gun shots and saw him pointing a gun at Alube who was then writhing in pain.Attempts to save his life did not yield fruits as he died while being rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital."I find that the defense presented by the accused was a bare denial but the evidence against him was overwhelming and unshaken, l reject the defense in total," the judge saidThe judge said he had considered that the teenager was a first offender and has been in remand for three years eight months.
