Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has accused rival Hillary Clinton of being "pumped up" during their last debate, saying they should both be tested for drugs before the next one.He also suggested the presidential race was looking like a "rigged election".The comments came in the wake of the publication of a recording in which he made obscene remarks, which sparked a string of sexual assault claims.Polls suggest Mr Trump is losing ground in some of the key battleground states.Speaking at a rally in New Hampshire, Mr Trump said Mrs Clinton had been "all pumped up" at the beginning of the last debate but could "barely reach her car" at the end."We should take a drugs test," he said.He did not provide any evidence to back up his claim.Donald Trump's personal attacks on Hillary Clinton are on the increase.He's nicknamed her Crooked Hillary, said he would put her in prison if he was elected president, described her as not having the stamina for the job and now he has accused her of taking some kind of drug.His rally speeches have become increasingly agitated and he has stepped up his rhetoric aimed at casting doubt on the fairness of this election, saying it is being rigged by a corrupt media pushing false allegations and outright lies.He may be trailing in the polls but he is managing to attract thousands of people to his rallies and raise funds.Meanwhile the Clinton campaign has hit back against Mr Trump's contention that women accusing him of sexual assault are part of a scheme to help elect Mrs Clinton president.Voting was to be encouraged and not "dismissed or undermined because a candidate is afraid he's going to lose", Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said.Mook said he expected a record turnout because voters could see through what he described as Mr Trump's "shameful attempts to undermine an election weeks before it happens".
