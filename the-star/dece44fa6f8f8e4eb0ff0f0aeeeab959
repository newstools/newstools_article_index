The national and Garissa governments have been urged to assist drought-stricken residents before lives are lost. The people of Garissa county are suffering in silence and are in dire need of water and food. The ongoing drought has left so many helpless and soon lives will be lost if aid is not provided, Shirr said. The county has reportedly been overwhelmed by the effects of the drought. Shirr urged the national government to stop politicking and prioritise the livelihoods of its citizens.The drought has hurt business as residents have no market for their malnourished livestock. Shirr said children have been forced to stay away from school as their parents cannot afford fees because the little money they is for food. The MP said the residents may resort to eating roots and leaves. There is starvation in the county. I can confirm that as leaders we have exhausted the funds allocated to us for assisting our constituents. This is why I am calling upon the national government to immediately provide food and water to the affected people, he said.
