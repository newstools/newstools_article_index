Has politics infiltrated the probe into the mishandling of Team Kenya during the Rio Olympics? Word has it that Sports CS Hassan Wario (pictured) is among a few untouchables and this is the reason he moved with speed to blame National Olympics Committee of Kenya officials and disband Nock - to absolve himself of blame for the Rio mess. Wario, during the Tuesday grilling by MPs over alleged mishandling of athletes in Rio, told the legislators President Uhuru Kenyatta fully supports the disbandment of Nock. Corridors is told the Jubilee administration can t sack or demand that Wario resign - to ensure Northeastern votes remain in its basket come 2017. Since Northeastern politics is based on clans, it is said touching Wario may bungle Jubilee s political game plan and see Cord reap big.************ A senior police officer has shocked many. The officer is the talk of the town. This is partially because the officer talks about corruption issues endlessly, but cannot explain the source of the money he is using to construct at least five houses in Nairobi and parts of Rift Valley. The buildings cost millions of shillings to put up and are coming up at the same time and at high speed. Many officers are asking why no so-called war on graft agency is questioning the source of the money. The officers revealed that such actions give them the morale to also steal because it is clear the money their boss is using for the projects is stolen public money and resources. The officers now want the boss to show their juniors where he got the loan to become a developer or they will also venture into serious eating .************ Some Northeastern MPs and governors are an aggrieved lot. Reason? The leaders are very unhappy with their clan elders, including the Garre, barring some of them from seeking reelection in 2017 while allowing others. Word has it that the leaders term the elders biased and question why they have given the nod to the election of some leaders and rejected others. The leaders are said to be reading malice in elders directive on negotiated democracy in the region in favour of the Jubilee Party. It is said they might be getting instructions from the Jubilee principals to bar leaders allied to Cord for them to reap Northeastern votes without breaking a sweat.************ Moles at the EACC have confided to Corridors that anti-corruption sleuths are going through the mobile phone data of their former boss Philip Kinisu to check who he communicated with and for what purpose during his time at Integrity Centre. The officers also want to focus their attention on those who may have talked to Kinisu in efforts to launch a planned vetting process. This gives an indication as to who was behind the Kinisu ouster - and for what reasons. However, some officers at the agency don t want to be held accountable! Our moles say that even the higher offices have gone mute on their war on graft and it s now everyone for himself/herself and the Devil take the hindmost.
