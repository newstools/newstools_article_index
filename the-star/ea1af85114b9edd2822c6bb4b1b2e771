Pada Security a family business is seeking strategic investors to buy a stake in the firm to fund planned expansion into other East African countries.The company said the strategy is based on rising demand for private security business in the region. Pada, which currently has a turnover of about Sh100 million, with more than 3,000 clientele across the country, was incorporated in 1993. It has a network of 10 branches in Nairobi, Kitengela, Githunguri, Kerugoya, Mwea, Thika, Ruiri, Murang'a and Nyeri. We also boast of a well-trained work force of 700 security guards with 20 per cent of them ex-service men, 12 full-time investigators and employees in the alarm system department. We have built the necessary structures for the firm to go to the next level," managing director David Kiiru said."We have a strong command and vigilance centre along the Nairobi-Naivasha highway with wide communication reach on radio and alarm systems." Some of the security-related services offered by Pada include car-tracking services, validating insurance claims, trained and fierce dog unit manned by professional dog handlers, installation of electric fences, private investigation, CCTV installation and guard-monitoring system. We have laid the foundation and infrastructure for the first generation of Pada Security firm, but we are now seeking fresh strategic shareholders to break the monotony of the family business, Kiiru said.The expansion plans, he said, are due to a rising need for security services buoyed by higher economic growth, as well as the growing middle class whose lives have become sophisticated.The demand for private security business went up following a series of terror attack that have rocked the country since the Westgate Mall attack on September 21, 2013. Most attractive private security services include guards, trained dogs and high-end equipment.Pada has also started a training institute in Kerugoya that trains more than 50 students monthly. Private security services industry in Kenya is projected to grow by over 100 per cent in the next three years.
