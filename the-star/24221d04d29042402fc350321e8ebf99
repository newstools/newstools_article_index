Cord leader Raila Odinga has for the third time cancelled a planned rally in Eldoret that was to be held today.Police had licensed the meeting after the opposition paid Sh100,000 to the Uasin Gishu county government to book 64 Stadium, where the rally was to be held.Sources said the meeting was cancelled out of fears there would have been a poor turnout in the region perceived to be Deputy President William Ruto s backyard. The meeting will be put on hold until a date to be announced soon, said secretary Kipkorir Menjo.Raila will fly to Segero SDA Church in Soy before heading to Kisumu where ODM will have rallies today. The opposition leader deemed it fit to honour the invitation at Segero where he was to visit early this year.Raila was to camp in Rift Valley from October 1 to popularise his presidential bid. Other sources within ODM said the opposition is finding it hard to organise meetings in North Rift, where Raila has no strong pointmen.But ODM officials, including branch chairman David Songok and Menjo, said the opposition enjoys considerable support. The defection of his key allies after the March 4, 2013 elections makes it hard for Raila to get a foothold in Rift Valley.
