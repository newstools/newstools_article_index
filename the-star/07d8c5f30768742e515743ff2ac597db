Students of Kibabii University yesterday went on the rampage, locked offices and chased off staff and workers. They also barricaded the Chwele-Bungoma road in Kanduyi constituency, Bungoma South. The students accused the university management of oppression.The more than 1,000 students criticised the university for insisting they clear their fees balance before resuming their studies and sitting exams. They said the university lacks proper infrastructure, despite their paying a lot of money. We do not have enough seats and are forced to carry the few available ones from one lecture hall to the other. Some of the buildings are old and they need to be painted and refurbished, one of the students said.Traders at Kibabii shopping centre were forced to close their businesses for fear of looting. Motorists too were forced to use alternative routes so their vehicles would not be stoned. The students carried placards, chanted and danced on the road. The Kibabii administration has taken us for fools but this time we have said enough is enough. We shall not allow the management to continue oppressing us, another student said. The students said they will continue to protest every Monday and disrupt lectures and economic activities around the campus if their grievances are not addressed. The students gave chancellor Ipar Odeo 24 hours to address the issues. By press time Prof Odeo could not be reached for comment as calls went unanswered. The protest comes a week after some Bukusu students protested, saying they are discriminated against.In March, the university was closed and all academic programmes indefinitely suspended following riots during student election campaigns. The students demonstrated on March 15, claiming the university s management was harassing them and interfering with the elections by endorsing a chairman candidate.
