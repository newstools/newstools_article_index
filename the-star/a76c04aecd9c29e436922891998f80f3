NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo has proposed the formation of a common public service board for all public universities and counties, to tame ethnic imbalance.The recommendation came after four audit reports revealed public universities and counties have not complied with the regional balance requirement of employing staff."Public universities are a dark story in complying with the law on regional balance. As things are now they can conduct business in one dialect depending on where the institution is situated," he said.He further accused the institutions of laxity and failing to perform their major roles, while promoting negative ethnicity despite being national institutions.The chairman said the board should be tasked with recruiting employees of counties and all public universities across the country.He noted the idea is not to sack staff but to consider employing people from different communities whenever there are vacancies."If the chancellor is from community X then the vice-chancellor should not come from the same community to at least allow other communities to serve based on merit," he said.He added that vacancies should be filled in a manner that complies with the law to curb regional imbalances.The National Cohesion and Integration Commission boss spoke at Mirando Secondary School in West Uyoma during a funds drive on Saturday.The proposal will ensure that people from different ethnic backgrounds work in learning institutions and counties other than their own, he said.He warned that if negative ethnicity goes on untamed, universities will stop being institutions where people can acquire knowledge.Kaparo was accused of improperly handling corruption allegedly executed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula said this following a survey by the commission that revealed the JSC was the only one of 15 commissions that has hired more than a third of its workforce from the same ethnic community.Read: JSC falls short of NCIC ethnic balance in recruitment, 39% Kikuyus hiredAlso read: NCIC treating tribalism by Uhuruto with kid gloves, Wetang'ula tells Kaparo
