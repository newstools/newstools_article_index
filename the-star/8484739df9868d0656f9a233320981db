More than 200 clerics and members of ACK on Monday jammed the High Court in Nyeri to support Bishop Joseph Kagunda facing a defamation charge.Three priests accused him of tarnishing their names by reading their dismissal letters before the congregation and the media. They were accused of gay activities. A court reinstated them last month.
