Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori has told off Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya for claims he, Dori, threatened to deny him the ODM ticket. Mvurya moved to the Jubilee Party on September 10, saying ODM leaders with vested interests had been fighting him. Dori, who has been silent about the issue, on Saturday said he has no personal differences with Mvurya. We only differ on political views. Saying you have moved out because Dori would not give you the party ticket is an allegation, he said. Mvurya said he will defend his seat on the JP ticket.He spoke at Gazi during the groundbreaking ceremony for Dori Secondary School. The MP said Coast voters do not look at the individual s personality but the political party. Dori urged voters not to listen to the governor, who now says they should vote for him as a person, not on the basis of his party.
