Nandi Governor Cleophas Lagat has said politicians should avoid inciting and dividing Kenyans along tribal lines. Lagat said the country is larger than any politician and none of them in Jubilee or Cord should be allowed to use incitement during campaigns. The country will remain after all of us are gone and leaders should campaign peacefully without inciting, Lagat said.
