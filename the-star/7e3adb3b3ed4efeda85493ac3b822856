Haki Africa wants IPOA to investigate three officers from Nyali police station alleged to have killed a 16-year-old boy in Kongowea. Executive director Hussein Khalid said a postmortem carried out at the Coast General Hospital by Dr Mbuko Ngali found two bullet wounds on the deceased's body.The officers said the boy was armed with pangas and other crude weapons and they acted for self-defence. Khalid said a friend of the deceased said they were walking home from a wedding when they saw a group of people hiding in a bush. They thought it was wakali kwanza and started running, but the officers fired at them.Khalid said the officers had the option to arrest the boy instead of shooting him. We will not sleep until we make sure the perpetrators are brought to book, he said.
