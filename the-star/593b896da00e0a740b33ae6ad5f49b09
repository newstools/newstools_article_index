Traders along Moi Avenue have added their voice to mounting complaints over poor service by Nairobi county government officials and threatened to withhold payments to the city. In a press conference yesterday, the traders and matatu operators along the avenue issued a one-week ultimatum to have roads along Moi Avenue repaired or they stop remitting the monthly seasonal ticket and taxes. Chairman of route 45 matatus Alex Njogu said his members incur a lot of losses due to the poor roads."Every week we must take our vehicles to the garage for repair," he said. Mwangi accused the county government of pushing away city investors.
