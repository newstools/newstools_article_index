A driver whose vehicle struck a 21-year-old man on Thika Superhighway was charged yesterday with the man s death. The driver was escaping from NTSA officials, who were administering alcoblow tests and drove on the wrong side fo the road.However, driver Job Nyongesa Wangila did not plead to the charges after he claimed the charge sheet was defective. He told Milimani magistrate Elector Riany the police, not the prosecution, prepared the sheet, contrary to law. It is alleged on January 30 at 3.30am, near GSU Drift, Wangila drove his vehicle dangerously on the wrong side of the road, hence ,threatening the lives of other road users.The car collided with an oncoming vehicle registration number KBQ 315V Nissan March. This led to the death of Brian Kiambati. Wangila is out on a cash bail of Sh100,000 and the court will rule whether the case will proceed with the same charge sheet or have it amended.
