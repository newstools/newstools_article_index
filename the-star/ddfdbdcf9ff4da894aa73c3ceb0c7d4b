South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has instructed his justice and crime prevention ministries to deal with the violence during student protests over tuition fees at universities, a cabinet spokesman said on Thursday.At least six universities' classes have been disrupted and some suspended as police and private security companies have tried to quell student dissatisfaction at a fee increase announced by government earlier this month."President Jacob Zuma has instructed the justice crime prevention and security cluster to deal with the mayhem that is destroying our institutions of higher learning," Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe told a post-cabinet media briefing.In a separate statement Zuma's office rejected rumours on social media that the nation's cabinet has been reshuffled.
