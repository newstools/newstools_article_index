Watch: Sonko causes scene at funeral says he is acting presidentBut the senator said his utterances were edited adding &quot;a section of the press is&nbsp;out to tarnish my name.&quot; &quot;My utterances were altered in the edited clip to depict my social, political and influence based position as challenging&nbsp;the presidency,&quot; he said in a statement on Saturday. He said&nbsp;the footage were drawn to &quot;delineate&nbsp;his character&quot; and tarnish his name based on his political inclination. &quot;This was further&nbsp;fueled&nbsp;by the seemingly bitter rivalry between my party and the wrangling Cord detach which was ably represented,&quot; he said. Sonko&#39;s comments compelled DPP&nbsp; Keriako Tobiko to&nbsp;direct&nbsp;IG Joseph Boinnet to&nbsp;question&nbsp;his utterances.

He said it was&nbsp; a &quot;shame that the DPP would be influenced to act on such claims.&quot; &quot; It&#39;s an act of incompetence.&nbsp; We will release the acquired footage for national transparency,&quot; he said. Kenyans on Twitter and leaders alike accused the Senator of allegedly committing treason.
