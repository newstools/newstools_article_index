Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has asked discontented members to ditch the party and seek fresh elections on parties of their choice.Some leaders elected on Wiper tickets continue to castigate the party while they still hold posts they got through the party, he said in an apparent reference to Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua.Mutua has recently been quoted criticising the Wiper leadership. It is funny when a member in the position of a governor goes round castigating the party that brought him to where he is today. If you have any speck of integrity and you are self-respecting, then be man or woman enough and resign from the party, Kalonzo said. I forgive them but pity them for I can foresee that none of those going against the community s political stand will be voted back come 2017. Kalonzo spoke on Sunday in Machakos during Cord s prayer rally for the Pangani Six and Muthaiga Two.He urged the Kamba community to remain steadfast in Wiper.His sentiments were echoed by the Wiper party chairman David Musila, who urged the community to vote out all Jubilee sympathisers in 2017. My prayer to you is that come 2017 you will help us send home all those that have been pocketed by the Jubilee government so that the respect for the community is maintained, the Kitui senator said.Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama said Jubilee wants to silence him to destabilise Kalonzo s political command in Ukambani. They are very much aware that Muthama is a staunch supporter of Kalonzo and if they silence him they will have succeeded in weakening Kalonzo, he said.
