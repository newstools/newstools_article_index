A traffic police woman has told the vetting panel that a parliamentary aspirant was the one who made huge deposits in her M-Pesa account. Joy Gitonga, who is based at Gilgil Weighbridge said Haron Hassan who is vying for Mandela parliamentary seat was her boyfriend. He is a public figure and I don t want to disclose much about him. We are no longer in good terms, Gitonga said. Chairman of the panel Leonard Musengi, however, told her she needs to be open to avoid speculation. We have many ideas in mind of the reason why he sent you hundreds of thousands of shillings. We don t care about the rank he holds as long as you are here. We need nothing but the truth, Musengi said. Gitonga said Hassan used to send her money once in a while for personal use before the relationship went sour.
