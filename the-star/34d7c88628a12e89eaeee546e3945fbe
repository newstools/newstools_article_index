There are worrying reports of drought in Tana River and Garissa. And yet no one in the national government is talking about it. In Garissa the drought has worsened dramatically.Governor Nathif Jama has declared the drought a disaster and warned of imminent loss of lives of both human beings and livestock.In Tana River, as the Star reported on September 30, more than 100,000 people are starving, in a prolonged dry spell. Entire herds of livestock are also in dire need of water and pasture. This drought started three months ago.Last week the Meteorological Department issued an advisory warning of depressed rainfall over a 90-day period.Once again, it looks as if a gruesome annual ritual is about to repeat itself, with the central government waiting until people and animals in drought-stricken arid and semi-arid areas die in droves before Nairobi talks about it and takes effective action.
