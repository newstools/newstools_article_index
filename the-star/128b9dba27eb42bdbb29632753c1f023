Former Kenya Sitting Volleyball Federation president Duncan Karanja will be seeking re-election in October 7 polls in Nairobi.This is a by-election for the presidential position following the nullification of Joseph Ndung u s election in April by the Sports Dispute Tribunal. The rest of the positions were not affected, and the newly elected officials have continued to run the federation s affairs.Polycarp Mboya petitioned to the Ttribunal after he was barred from contesting for the presidency on the voting floor without being given a chance to defend himself. This, the Tribunal was told, was due to Mboya s connection to the Kenya Amputee Football Federation (as the treasurer) which was suspended by world body (IAFF) following a default in paying debts.The above named trio Karanja, crestfallen Ndung u and Mboya will face off in the the presidential election. Karanja has served the federation since April 2012 as the president, while Ndung u and Mboya are elected chairmen of Nakuru and Nairobi branches respectively. Karanja didn t contest in April elections due illness and after full recovery, he says he still feels there is much he can offer the sport. The elections come after the Sports Disputes Tribunal confirmed the federation s electoral rules ratification and compliance of other requirements.
