The Kisumu assembly yesterday passed a motion to have Lake Victoria restocked with fingerlings. North West Kisumu MCA Samuel Ombogo said it is important for the county to pass a law to allow the executive to buy and introduce 10 million tilapia or Nile perch fingerlings every year to the lake. He said fish is a major source of revenue for residents. It is shameful for our people consume fish from China, yet we have a fresh water lake, nominated MCA Aslam Khan said. Assembly chief whip Isaiah Onyango said, however, the MCAs should engage the Fisheries department before its implementation. The county has a deficit of 4,000 tonnes of fish.
