Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has said residents want his name on the ballot so rigging during primaries will not be accepted .He urged Wiper party officials to resign from their posts to ensure free and fair elections. Malombe will face off with Wiper national chairman and Senator David Musila for the top seat. He said Wiper should follow the example of the Jubilee Party and bar those seeking elective positions from holding positions in the party. I have said time and again that Musila and other partly leaders eyeing elective positions must quit their posts. I will continue making the demand until they quit, Malombe said on Wednesday in Kitui town after he signed an MoU with the Kenya Red Cross Society.
