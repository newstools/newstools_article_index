Despite our effort to solve the problem by combining several flights, we have made the difficult decision to cancel," it said.The airline said some of their outsourced staff including cabin crew stayed away from work from Friday and have not yet returned."We are working with their employer to resolve any issues they may have," the airline said.The airline apologised for the inconvenience caused and guests on cancelled flight adding "guests will be re-booked on later flights or alternative airlines."On Friday, Kenya Airways announced that its fleet is running a normal schedule including the sale of tickets at all purchase points.The airline threatened to stop selling tickets on its network if the pilots union does not retract a strike notice issued after another flight delay.Sources also told the Star the cabin crew downed their tools citing poor relations with management and poor medical benefits.But in a statement on Friday, KQ said: "All flights scheduled for today were crewed and on schedule." The airline noted it operates up to 160 flights a day in its network.Read: State asks pilots to call off planned strike, warns of serious consequencesRead: The challenge of turning around Kenya AirwaysAlso read: Kenya Airways bosses cannot end loss-making streak, says pilots union
