Five politicians have declared interest in Junet Mohamed's Suna East MP seat in the next election, in what will test ODM's pledge for free and fair nominations.Junet, who is the party's elections director, is considered party leader Raila Odinga's 'blue-eyed boy' and major defender.With just 10 months left to the August polls, he has been concentrating on consolidating ground support for what could end up being a three-horse race.Migori and Nairobi businessman Patrick 'Jawaswetta' Odipo and immediate former Migori MP John Pesa have been seen as leading the pack.Read: Raila warns ODM elections board against bribery in run-up to 2017 pollJunet attended several functions in the constituency over the last two weekends, including burials and a funds drive in Migori town. I have not seen any worthy contestor. Odipo can do well as Suna Central MCA while Pesa has never boosted the image of Suna East nationally the way I have," he said.He added he was too busy assisting Raila to win the presidential race, to concentrate on constituency politics.Read: Eyes set on governor Obado as Raila leads Junet thanksgiving rally in MigoriBut Odipo told the Star by phone on Monday that the Wasweta and Kakrao clans, where he hails from, form the bulk of voters and that campaigns have been aimed at selling individuals and not the party.He said he has directly approached voters with the development agenda to ensure he gets to the ballot, regardless of the number of nominations that will be carried out.He added: Junet has been on the record saying Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero will not be given the ODM ticket, which makes Suna East elections an acid taste on free and fair elections."Pesa said the constituency's politics will be shaped by a leader who sits with the people as opposed to having a primary national focus.The politician, who spoke during a burial in Nyabisawa area on Sunday, enjoys massive support in Nyarongi area. His record in the education sector while he was MP has also helped.Among those who have declared interest in the seat is Nairobi majority leader Elias Otieno (Kileleshwa) who may rival Junet in popularity.Others are immigration officer Tom Hillary and local businessman Hezron Onyango.Migori county ODM organising secretary Joseph Nyambori said the nominations will be free and fair, despite Junet's closeness to Raila. Aspirants should not be afraid of taking a stab at the seat because party positions will not determine the nomination process, he said.But Nyambori said Junet closeness to Raila might have caused four aspirants who vied with him in the last election to change their minds.They are Peter Jobando, Owino Likowa, Ogolla Ogolla and immediate former speaker Gordon Ogolla.
