An NGO has warned the IEBC against leading the country to the elections when it is ill-prepared.The Inter-Regional Peace Network raised concerns yesterday after the IEBC last week protested against the new electoral law, which has hurt electoral timelines.Executive director Fredrick Ogweno said the commission should table its grievances for discussion, instead of plunging the country into anarchy .Ogweno spoke during the launch of the Beyond Tribe programme, which aims to prevent election violence.The programme involves raising awareness on the dangers of violence by taking a holistic approach to youth unemployment, drug and alcohol addiction. The commission should not accept to take Kenyans to the polls if it indeed knows it is unprepared. The commission has lately complained that the new electoral laws have messed up its electoral timelines.These are issues we as a country must confront and candidly address, Ogweno said.
