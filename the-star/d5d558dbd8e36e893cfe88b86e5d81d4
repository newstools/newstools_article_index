Given the chaos that descended on the 2013 election from the total collapse of the IEBC s very expensive (and supposedly infallible) ICT system, to the inordinate delay in the release of some of the election results it has been easy for the partisans in Cord zones to insist that the election was not won fair and square by the Jubilee Alliance.The historical experience of Kenyans has been that if there is a great deal of unexpected chaos around any election, that is all the proof needed that government-sponsored rigging is underway.So the legitimacy of the current government led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto rests primarily on the Supreme Court decision that declared them to be properly elected, rather than on any national consensus that Uhuru won a clean victory .This failure to arrive at this national consensus shown most conspicuously in the continuing deep division between Cord zones and Jubilee zones carried on from the 2013 election is largely due to the conviction among hardcore Cord supporters that Raila went into that election with too great a support base to lose in a free and fair election.In crude tribal terms, Raila's supporters remained convinced that a two-tribe alliance of Kalenjin and Gikuyu/Embu/Meru voters, could not possibly come up with a greater tally at the elections than Cord, given that these communities add up to barely 45% of the Kenyan population.Of course Uhuru and Ruto only enhanced this perception in the heady days immediately after their victory, by speaking openly of the presidency being exchanged between these two tribes for the next few decades, if not indefinitely.Well, they seem to have learned from their mistake. Going into the 2017 general election, a narrative is building up which will make it very difficult to delegitimize an Uhuru Kenyatta presidency, if indeed he does win reelection.The president and his deputy have taken pains to systematically woo the voters of the regions that rejected them in 2013, which can reasonably be argued to be swing vote areas the Kisii counties; Western Kenya; and the Coast.Cord has had its way in getting the IEBC commissioners kicked out of office and has some say in who gets to serve in the next commission.All this culminates in the launch this weekend of a single giant political party the Jubilee Party which cannot be said to be dominated by just two regions, putting to rest any replay of the 41-against-1 political formula so dreaded in Central Kenya.
