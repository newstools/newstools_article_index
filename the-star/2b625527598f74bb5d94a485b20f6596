A businessman has accused two police officers based at the Kasarani police station of allegedly harassing and threatening to shoot him at his business premises on Sunday.Samuel Nguyo, a bar and restaurant owner in Roysambu, said the officers had taken beer worth Sh400 but declined to clear the bill. They were three people, two police officers and a civilian. When the waiter asked for money, they became violent, he said.Nguyo said the officers removed their pistols and threatened to shoot him when he intervened.He said he reported the matter to the same police station but was told senior officers, to whom he could report the case were away.Kasarani police boss Robinson Mboloi said he had not received the complaint but pledged to investigate and take action against the officers, if they are found blameworthy.Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome did not comment on the issue. He said he was in a meeting.Police spokesman Charles Owino (pictured) urged Nguyo to report the matter to the Police Internal Affairs Unit for immediate action. If this is true, he better report to the internal unit because the officers went overboard. But again, we must ascertain the claims, he said.
