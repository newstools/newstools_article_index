Taita Taveta residents have criticised Cord leader Raila Odinga, who blamed the Jubilee government for corruption and excluding county governments.In social media comments, the residents said corruption is rife in Taita Taveta county, but Raila did not say anything about it in his three-day tour of the county.Stephen Saleka said the opposition leader should not apply double standards in the war on corruption. Corruption has denied Kenyans opportunities to grow economically. Raila should also take to task governors and MCAs from his political side. They have been mentioned in auditor reports for failing to account for public funds. This is hypocrisy and undermines the spirit of devolution, he said on Facebok.On the Taita Taveta Citizenry Forum Facebook page, Alfred Kasenge posted, It s a visit that seems to have no impact on the residents of Taita Taveta since Raila couldn t address the highest level corruption surrounding our county government. He went ahead to sell the ODM party, which is becoming difficult to buy. Corruption was also the topic in several WhatsApp groups. Raila accused the Jubilee government of propagating corruption through the standard gauge railway and the Eurobond.Raila said if Cord forms the next government, it will ensure the counties get 45 per cent of the national government revenue share, not the current 15 per cent.
