The controversial Yala Swamp project might just be Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga s undoing in next year s general election, if not handled with care. Rasanga, who has supported the development of the swamp, changed his stand after Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo alleged he pocketed Sh70 million.Midiwo alleges Rasanga and two MCAs misappropriated the money after they sold 6,000 hectares ( 14,826 acres) of the swamp to Godavari, an Indian company, without the public s knowledge. But Rasanga and MCAs Leonard Oriaro and Silvester Madialo say the allegation is baseless. They have asked Midiwo to file a case in court.Wrote to NLCThe swamp is Kenya s largest freshwater wetland. It is occupied by Dominion Farm, which had Rasanga s complete support before the controversy broke out and the governor issued fresh conditions. If Dominion will not adhere to lease terms, including giving back to the community, ending release of hazardous chemicals and opening the closed channel to Lake Kanyaboli, I will mobilise residents, Rasanga said.He has written to the National Land Commission to stop leasing land in the swamp until the survey is carried out and a land use plan is established. Despite the governor s clarification, his rivals insist he is working with the investors to shortchange residents.Midiwo has reached out to all governor contenders to form a political alliance with a leader popular enough to dislodge Rasanga. He doesn t mean well for our people, especially those whose land was taken over by Dominion, he said.In 2013, Madialo was elected unopposed while Oriaro defeated his opponents by a landslide because of their strong defence of those living on the Yala Swamp. Midiwo has hinted he will fight for the swamp s residents, even if it does not fall in his constituency.
