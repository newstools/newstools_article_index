Two Rift Valley legislators have asked women to come out and seek elective posts rather than relying on nominated positions.Baringo Central MP Sammy Mwaita and his Barwesa counterpart Joseph Makilap said that it is only through this that the country will be able to cut cost on legislative representation wage bill. Women should fight for their place in parliament and stop relying on nominated positions so as to cut the amount spent on nominated positions. They are equally fit to be elected and giving them nominated seats only makes them seem inferior which is not the case, Mwaita said.He pointed out the Senatorial, Women Representatives and nominated MPs and MCAs seats among positions that needed to be cut out of the Constitution.His Barwesa counterpart, Makilap also proposed to cut the number of representation in Parliament.Read: Audit calls for reduction of MPs, MCAsThis follows an audit committee that looked into implementation of 2010 Constitution of Kenya that recommended a reduction in the number of legislators to reduce the wage bill.According to Auditor General, report presented to Parliament last week Kenyans are spending far too much on MPs and MCAs in 47 counties.The report that was presented to Parliament is yet to be debated on whether lucrative positions should be abolished or their number reduced, and whether their salaries and benefits should be reduced for the public good.The report reveals, Kenya spends Sh20.6 million annually on a single MP.The audit also found that the percentage growth of the public wage bill has been rising dramatically by 15.42 per cent in 2012 and by 16.75 per cent in 2013."Between 2012 and 2014, the economy grew by an average of 5.2 per cent thus the public wage bill, therefore, grew at a faster rate than the economy,The report was prepared by the Working Group on the Socio-Economic Audit of the 2010 Constitution, chaired by Auditor General Edward Ouko.Also read: Kuria wants Senate scrapped, governors cut to 16 to reduce wage
