Thika United FC head coach James Nandwa expressed his disappointment on the matter. I am very upset and I feel let down by Luvutsi. Seeing that he is a senior player and exhibiting bad behaviour in my presence and the technical bench, is sheer disrespect of me and those who have employed me, regretted Nandwa. If a player wants to leave any club not only Thika United, it s always prudent to leave with blessings. I cannot work with a player who doesn t respect me as his coach, finished the coach. Luvutsi, the club further revealed has already been issued his termination letter and the club wishes him all the best in his endeavours.Thika, who look to have exorcised the ghost of relegation that haunted them for much of the current campaign face Nairobi City Stars this Saturday knowing that victory over the relegation-threatened outfit will mathematically assure them of a place in the SportPesa Premier League for another year. As it stands with five matches left to play, Thika have 25 points while City Stars have 17.
