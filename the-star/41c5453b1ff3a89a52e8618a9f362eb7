The new Jubilee Party was launched over the weekend promising a new era of unity in Kenya.It is true that 11 parties have collapsed themselves into Jubilee, which is now the largest political grouping with representation from most parts of the country.But that is not enough to build a long-lasting party, especially when the nomination process has proved inherently divisive for all parties in Kenya.Nor can Kenya be a single-party state. Unity cannot go that far. So Jubilee will have to compete for political power in future.And in the end, if Jubilee is to stand the test of time, it will have to compete on policies. Jubilee needs to spell out its policies on taxation, privatisation, agriculture, health, etc. It is not enough to just promise goodies such as roads, hospitals or laptops. That will not cut across ethnic boundaries in the long-term.So far both Cord and Jubilee have been more concerned with ethnic arithmetic than policies. And therefore both remain inherently fragile.
