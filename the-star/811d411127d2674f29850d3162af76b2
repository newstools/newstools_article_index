High flying Kenya Simbas devoured a hopeless Hong Kong Dragons 34-10 during the Tatu City international test series match played at the RFUEA grounds on Saturday.The win serves as a bitter sweet revenge given that the last time the two sides met, the Simbas were clawed 17- 44 back in 2011 in Dubai during an Emirates Airline Cup tie which also served as their only test then.The Simbas led by skipper Brian Nyikuli piled pressure on the visitors right from kick off resulting to a Hong Kong offside. Darwin Mukidza aka smiling assassin was quick to grab Kenya early three point lead in the game.Joseph Kangethe then added a try which was converted by Mukidza to put the Simbas at 10-0 lead taking charge of the game.Tony Owuor got a long pass from David Ambunya at the wing and the playmaker did not hesitate to cross Hong Kong s try line. Mukidza added the extras as the visitors were left pondering in shock after the quick 17 nil trail.Mukidza continued to show his kicking prowess by slotting in another penalty making things 20-0 for the Simbas. The visitors however managed a consolation penalty in the dying minutes of the first half but damage was already done as the scoreline remained at 20-3. Nato Simiyu started the action in the second half after a chip shot from Mukidza to score for the Simbas as the Dragons went for a short time out to put things in order. Mukidza drilled the ball between the posts to add the extras as Simbas extended their lead to a comfortable 27-3.Changes in the second half came with Samson Onsomu replacing Edwin Achayo shortly before Mukidza scored and converted his own try to widen the gap to 34-3. Dan Sikuta came in for Simon Muniafu after the later pulled a hand injury with Sammy Warui and Max Adaka replacing Peter Karia and Brian Nyikuli.Dragon s substitute Hugo Stiles scored their only try as Roslee made the successful conversion but that could not still untame them as the match finished 34-10.
