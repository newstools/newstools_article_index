Some 35 Bungoma MCAs have endorsed Alfred Khang ati for governor. The MCAs are from both Jubilee and Cord. Led by minority leader Ali Machani, they said the former Kanduyi MP is best-placed to replace Governor Kenneth Lusaka. Khanga ti lost to Lusaka in the March 4, 2013, general election. Khang ati initiated many projects in Kanduyi and we feel that he can use the same experience to initiate development projects in this county, Machani said. He spoke after they met Khang ati in Bungoma town on Tuesday evening. I really feel sorry for you because you are carrying blame, which is not for you but for Lusaka. It is good you have identified some leadership qualities in me. I will not let you down, Khang ati said. Ford Kenya s Wycliffe Wangamati has also expressed interest in the seat.
