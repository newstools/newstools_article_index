Ex-prisoners could begin getting clearance documents after completing their jail terms to show they have reformed. This will help them seek employment.The Power of Mercy Advisory Committee is proposing a recommendation letter for rehabilitated inmates or those pardoned by the President.Pomac CEO Michael Kagika said, however, the state will not acquit the convicts or clear them of past offences in the recommendations. This will be a letter to tell the prospective employer that although the person has been convicted and jailed, they petitioned the President and were pardoned, after they were vetted and found to have fully reformed, he said. It will tell the potential employer that this is a person we would vouch for to be hired after a successful petition and assessment to help them hasten integration back into the society. Assistant commissioner general of Prisons David Macharia supported the proposal, saying most prisoners acquire skills they can use to earn a living.
