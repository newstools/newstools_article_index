We must have credible nominations so losers can be content with the outcome, Wahome said.He warned Jubilee s elected leaders against assuming they have the mandate to allocate tickets for themselves. I have heard there are certain people who will get specific seats. There is no seat reserved for anybody, Wahome said. No one should wait to be given the ticket. There shall be no boardroom selection of candidates. I want to tell them we have the capability to send them home. Karanja said the IEBC must impartially oversee the elections. He said shambolic nominations could make the polls agency lose its credibility. We want to see the independence of the commission during the nominations so aspirants and the electorate can have trust in it, he said.Karanja echoed Wahome s words and warned incumbents against uniting to deny others the opportunity to challenge them. He said they must not share the elective seats among themselves.
