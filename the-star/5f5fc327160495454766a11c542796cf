Most parts of the country will be warm and dry, while a few will receive showers, Kenya Meteorological Services director J Gacheru has said.Currently, some parts of the Coast and Northeastern are experiencing drought, with 1.3 million Kenyans facing starvationThe Met Department says Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori, Kisii, Nyamira, Trans Nzoia, Baringo, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet and Nandi counties are expected to experience sunny intervals with some showers and thunderstorms in some places.Laikipia, Nakuru, Narok, Kajiado, Kericho, Bomet, Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma and Busia counties will also experience sunny intervals in the mornings, with showers and thunderstorms over few places.The week s forecast indicates that Turkana, West Pokot and Samburu counties will experience sunny intervals throughout.Nairobi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang a, Kiambu, Meru, Embu and Tharaka Nithi counties will experience sunny intervals with a likelihood of afternoon showers over few high-ground areas from tomorrow. Other counties like Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Isiolo, Kitui, Makueni, Machakos and Taita Taveta are expected to experience sunny intervals the whole day throughout the forecast period, Gacheru said.Mombasa, Tana River, Kilifi, Lamu and Kwale will receive occasional showers over few places in the morning, but afternoons are expected to be mainly sunny.Drought warningAccording to the National Drought Management Authority, most arid and semi-arid counties are experiencing some degree of drought stress as the dry season draws to a close.Kilifi county is in the alarm drought phase, while all others are in alert or normal, with a generally worsening trend.In parts of Kilifi, Garissa, Lamu, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Makueni, Kajiado, Narok and Marsabit there are now significant shortages of pasture and water, and in some cases livestock deaths.The early warning report says the food insecurity situation is exacerbating with conflict in some counties, especially along the borders of Isiolo and Garissa where pastoralists convergence is common. If the season is below average, as currently forecast, or its onset is late, then the drought situation will become significantly worse, with impacts on health and nutrition, household purchasing power, and security, the reports states. The implications of a poor season are particularly worrying for the marginal agricultural counties, which are short rains-dependent, it says.
