Mpeketoni police officers attempted to conceal the murder of a 22-year-old woman by their colleague, an investigations officer told a court on Wednesday.Constable Oliver Nabonwe is investigating the death of Margaret Njeri. He was testifying against Salim Mohamed, who is charged with murdering Margaret Njeri by hitting her on the head with a G3 rifle on January 17 last year. Njeri was riding on a boda boda from Mpeketoni Township to Usiwa. Boda boda operator George Wachira defied orders by two police officers to stop. When the accused [Mohamed] realised Wachira was defying his orders, he rushed to the road and extended his G3 riffle to stop him, Nabonwe said.Wachira ducked and Njeri was hit by the gun on the head and fell off the motorcycle onto the road. She was rushed to Mpeketoni Subcounty Hospital, transferred to the Coast General Hospital and later to Pandya Hospital, where she died on March 12.Nabonwe told Malindi resident judge Said Chitembwe records at the Occurrence Book in Mpeketoni indicated the death as self-involved serious accident at Sikomani.He said the OB report had eight names of police officers and the victim. Nabonwe said a fellow officer, Kelvin Sikolia, had not been included in the report, even though he was present at the crime scene. He said the scene was photographed.Nabonwe told the court he found out there was a cover-up in the OB. He said Mohamed and nine other police officers were on official patrol to enforce a curfew imposed by the government.Nabonwe said all the officers were armed. He said some stopped and arrested a motorist, Paul Maina, who was carrying two passengers, a mother and her daughter.
