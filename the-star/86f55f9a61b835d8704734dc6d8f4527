Opposition leader Raila Odinga has supported Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka's proposal to have parties affiliated to the Cord coalition hold joint nominations.The ODM leader said those who win the coalition's ticket will vie under the Cord coalition in the 2017 general elections.In a statement on Tuesday, Raila said the proposal which is similar to that of Narc in 2002 will help the coalition avoid competition between constituent parties that saw them split votes and lose seats in some areas."In this arrangement, all parties will present candidates for nomination and the overall winner will fly the coalition s ticket as Odm/ Cord, Wiper/ Cord or Ford Kenya/Cord," he said.On Monday, Kalonzo had proposed that the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) be registered as a political party.The former Vice President however stated that this would not mean the dissolution of affiliate parties like in the Jubilee coalition, but would reduce fallouts.Kalonzo further added that Wiper party will hold a National Executive Committee meeting on September 20, and among other issues deliberate on the proposal.This is as Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has opposed the move saying Cord "will not use the style of their enemy".He said that dissolving parties would take the country back to the one-party state era of former president Daniel Moi.Read: Kanu to reap big from Jubilee merger fallout, Raymond MoiKhalwale further said the constitution clearly states that Kenya is a multi-party state and that past leaders paid dearly to bring the country to where it is today.Also read: Ruto defends merger of parties under Jubilee, calls for unity in war on graft
