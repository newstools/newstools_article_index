Most Kenyans prefer three-star hotels for their leisure and business trips, a study by online hotel search firm Jumia Travel indicates.The Kenyan Domestic Tourism 2015-16 report released on Wednesday shows 50 per cent of bookings through Jumia travel are for three-star hotels.This is because they are affordable, have flexible rules and offer personalised services such as self catering in cottages, the report said. More customers are looking at cheaper accommodation. People want flexibility, moving away from strict rules at high-end facilities, Jumia Travel Kenya country manager Cyrus Onyiego said.Unlike two and one-star hotel which have limited amenities and services, a three-star hotel has lounges, bars, decently spaced rooms, high-class decorations and furnishings, and a TV in the room.The study covering 2,000 hotels, ranging from budget to five-star facilities, shows most of the bookings are for families and business travel. Nairobi is the most sought after destination in Kenya accounting for 29 per cent of bookings across the country between January 2015 and June 2016.It is followed by Mombasa which accounted for 15 per cent of bookings, and coming third was Naivasha-Nakuru region with 10 per cent. Jumia East and Southern Africa managing director Estelle Verdier attributed the high bookings in the city to an increase in meetings, conferences and exhibitions. Ninety per cent of these bookings are business especially in Nairobi, which has gained pace as a MICE destination, Verdier said.
