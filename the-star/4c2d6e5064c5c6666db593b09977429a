A 'pregnant man' gut, is hardly unique with many women having their very own 'pregnant man' at home. And whether it's a look they find attractive, the worry is that a fat gut is potentially a ticking health time bomb. Fat around the middle is particularly harmful to health, raising the risk of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. In fact a major study from the U.S. recently found having a fat tummy was more deadly than being obese all over.So here are a few simple cruel but kind pointers to help you get your man back in shape. Position a full-length mirror where he gets dressed and undressed every day. A man can only suck in his belly for only so long before he has to breathe (or diet). Find an unflattering picture of the two of you on a recent holiday and stick it on the fridge door next to a romantic (considerably slimmer) picture from when you first met - it works well as an appetite suppressant. Be absent-minded when you shop: 'forget' to stock up on biscuits, cakes, sausage rolls and crisps, but ensure there are healthy snacks (fruit, hummus and yogurt) at eye-level in the fridge. Re-stock his underwear drawer with one size smaller shorts - remove the labels. The discomfort may lead to him trying to cut down.
