Eveready East Africa will sell its assets in Nakuru, including 18.5 acres of land, and relocate to Nairobi, the former giant battery maker's extraordinary general meeting resolved yesterday."This sale is also part of management's strategy to unlock funds for investment in more productive areas of the company," Eveready's managing director Jackson Mutua said in Nakuru. The firm, which closed its Nakuru-based dry cell manufacturing factory, has a debt of Sh509 million. The organisation now imports battery from Egypt's Energizer company. Eveready will spend an estimated Sh1.2 billion proceeds from the disposal of the assets to offset the debt. We will buy a one-acre land along Mombasa road, which is between Nakuru and Machakos county, to construct the company headquarters and also have a godown, the company's chairperson Lucy Waithaka said. The board of directors sought an approval to change the firm's name. It was agreed it will operate under a new name, Eveready Public Ltd Company.During the stormy meeting, some stakeholders walked out after a section of shareholders proposed the land in Nakuru be sold. I and my fellow stakeholders will not allow the Nakuru property to be sold. You can take a loan and offset the loan. It's not advisable to sell the land we have had for more than 50 years. How sure are you all the debts will be settled after you sell the asset? said Daniel Gathogo, a stakeholder.Waithaka, however, reassured them that all debts will be paid after the sale.The Nakuru property has been largely idle since the company closed its manufacturing facility in 2014."The company's levels of borrowing are unsustainable and the persistent high interest rate regime continues to hurt our business and erode shareholder value," the MD said.
