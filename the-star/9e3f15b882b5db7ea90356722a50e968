Event organiser Akinyi Adongo came up with a fundraising concept themed Africans For Elephants to raise money towards elephant conservation projects in the continent. It is to achieve this by hosting a series of fully sponsored events throughout Africa, with the support of likeminded individuals and companies to ensure that all ticket sales and any other funds raised at the events went to the cause. The inaugural event was a formal fundraising ball which was held on Saturday evening at the Village Market rooftop. Sponsored by Crown Paints, the proceeds from ticket sales, raffles and paintings sold went to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and The Walk With Rangers Initiative.Among those in attendance were Crown Paints marketing manager Gurdeep Kaur, Chandaria Industries group CEO Darshan Chandaria, British Peace Support team commander Dennis Ryan and US diplomat Charlee Doom.
