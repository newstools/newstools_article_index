Nairobi woman representative aspirant Millicent Omanga wants the Micro-finance Act amended so interest rates can come down.Speaking to the Star on the phone, she said despite bank interest rates reducing, interest rates for micro-finance loans have not reduced.She said the Banking Act that lowere interest rates only serves well-off people, not common wananchi."Majority of women and youth cannot afford bank loans because they do not have salaries. They are forced to go to micro-finance institutions, where interest rates are still high. We have to amend the Act to help low-income earners," Omanga said.She said Nairobi women suffer because of poor leadership from legislators who do not have their interests at heart.Omanga said most women leaders wait for men to endorse them, instead of fighting for the positions.She said if elected, she will work hard to ensure boys are not neglected.
