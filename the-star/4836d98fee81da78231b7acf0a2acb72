Artistes and film producers yesterday rejected wholesome proposed laws that would require anyone posting videos on the internet and social media obtain a licence from the Kenya Film Classification Board.They said at a public forum that the proposed amendments will curtain freedoms and prevent the growth of the film industry. This document says that anyone making any material, regardless of the media is a broadcaster. This means, KFCB can regulate anyone with a mobile phone that can take videos, Nest Arts director George Gachara said. If the producer and the contractor are meant to be fined Sh5 million or sent to jail for four years, (then) this will keep upcoming producers and filmmakers away from the industry that we are trying to grow. KFCB chief executive Ezekiel Mutua said his organisation, which proposed the changes to the Films, Stage Plays and Publications 2016, would reconsider its next move. Since they have said they do not want those proposals, we will go back to the drawing board, he said.The proposal authorised police to be present during the shooting of a broadcast film and to stop any scene an officer felt in his or her opinion is unlawful.It also exposed internet service providers to fines of Sh2 million or imprisonment of two years, if they failed to review all the videos exhibited and distributed through their platforms.
