Chase Bank, the mid-tier lender placed under receivership last April, is repositioning itself to reclaim the women and youth-run enterprises businesses it lost during receivership to ahead of full recovery. Central Bank governor Patrick Njoroge on September 21 said the bank is a bright spot in the ongoing due diligence to lift its receivership status. Youth banking has always been a core pillar for Chase Bank, and therefore we are always keen to take part in initiatives that support the growth of young entrepreneurs as the youth are the future of this country, Chase s youth banking manager Lonina Leteipan said at the Young Entrepreneurs Dinner in Nairobi.
