The Kenya Pharmaceuticals Distributors Association wants the Health ministry to reduce the cost of essential medicines. Chairman Kamamia Murichu said many Kenyans die daily because multinational drug companies deliberately keep the cost of medicines high, making the life-saving drugs unaffordable to many. The cost of the Augmentin drug in Kenya ranges between Sh1,200 and Sh1,300. The same drug costs the equivalent of Sh300 in Turkey. This is unacceptable, Murichu said.He said multinationals have deliberately ensured antibiotics and cancer drugs are overpriced, thereby denying Kenyans a chance for quality medical care. Murichu spoke in an interview with the Star. He said his association campaigns for an enabling legal environment to allow cheap drugs to be made widely available.He said parallel importation in which traders compete with commissioned dealers will reduce prices by more than half.
