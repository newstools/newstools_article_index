The Murang a government has started sinking 30 boreholes as the debate on the Northern Collector Tunnel continues.Governor Mwangi Wairia said the county will also rehabilitate 30 abandoned boreholes.He said the project aims to provide water for more than 300,000 residents in Makuyu, Ithanga, Kakuzi, Kambiti, Kimorori Wempa, Kamahuha, Kambirwa and Gaturi.Wairia said the county has set aside Sh500,000 for water this financial year. He said the project and others already implemented will complement the national government s efforts to provide water.Wairia said the majority of the eight water projects, which the Athi Water Services Board has pledged as compensation for drawing water from the county, have already started. The projects will cost Sh4.4 billion. The Gatanga water project has already started. Another project has started to provide water for Murang a and Kenol towns and a major Sh2 billion irrigation project in Ithanga is at the tendering stage, Wairia said.He said the county will push the national government to fast-track the construction of the tunnel to ensure the eight projects are completed as soon as possible.Speaking when he toured a borehole being dug at Mithini in Makuyu on Sunday, Wairia said residents do not want empty promises. This is the reason we have made our stand very clear, that anybody fighting the Northern Collector Tunnel is fighting provision of water to the people, he said.
