The Central Bank is to be commended for its Banking Circular No 6 of 2016 issued yesterday. The CBK notifies the banks all new products or charges must first be approved by the Bank (see story page 18).The banks are going into all sorts of contortions and arbitrary measures to try and circumvent the recent capping of interest rates at 14 per cent, which is still high by world standards.The circular says the CBK Act outlaws charges on savings, seven-day, call and fixed deposit accounts.And it also warns that any change not approved by the CBK is illegal.For instance, Gulf African Bank has sent an SMS to its savings account customers saying it takes this opportunity to inform you that your account has been changed to a current account to enable you [sic] manage your day to day transactions with ease at no extra cost .This was done without prior consultation or notice.The CBK moved just in the nick of time.
