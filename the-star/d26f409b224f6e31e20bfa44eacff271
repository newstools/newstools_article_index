A plan by Kakamega assembly chief whip Loi Maviala to remove majority leader Robert Makhanu backfired on Wednesday when she was instead replaced.Maviala accused Makhanu of not paying the allowances of the Cord MCAs who attended the ODM 10th anniversary in Mombasa. She said Makhanu mobilised members to attend the event and only paid them Sh5,000 each.Maviala accused Makhanu of being involved in irregular use of funds meant for MCAs retreats and looking down on the ward representatives.The assembly chief whip said Makhanu allowed the construction of the new assembly chambers on disputed land.Maviala s plot started crambling during a Cord MCAs meeting at Ampel Hotel in Kakamega on Tuesday.Marama South MCA Willis Opuka said he is friends with Makhanu and Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and removing the majority leader would amount to betraying the governor.Makhanu then called a meeting for ODM representatives at the assembly on Wednesday. Members unanimously resolved to replace Maviala with Shirere MCA Joe Serenge. Mahiakalo MCA Cleophas Malala said some of the accusations against Makhanu were decisions made by the assembly service board and he should not be held solely accountable. If they have to remove Makhanu then it must be the entire board, he said.Isukha West MCA Edward Shivembe said the shenanigans over the assembly leadership are part of a wider scheme by Oparanya to control the executive and assembly. Oparanya is currently in Britain.Shivembe said Maviala was sent by Oparanya to push for Makhanu s removal because the executive wants to sack assembly clerk Patrick Kamwesa. They know the only way to fire the clerk is to start with Makhanu so that investigations can net him, he said. But county head of communication Sumba Juma said Oparanya does not interfere with assembly operations. The governor s work is to implement what the assembly passes, he said.
