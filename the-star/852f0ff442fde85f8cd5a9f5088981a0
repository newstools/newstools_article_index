Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has condemned the public spat between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Cord leader Raila Odinga at the funeral of late former minister William Ntimama on Wednesday.In a statement issued yesterday, he termed as despicable the altercation between Uhuru and Raila on who owned Ntimama politically. Every leader must exercise restraint. There was no need for the juvenile exchange at such a solemn occasion. I was both ashamed and embarrassed these are the people Kenyans vote for, Mudavadi said. Why would you want to claim closeness? Only the dead can be witness, he said.Mudavadi took a swipe at the Jubilee administration, saying corruption and mockery are its watermark. He said Kenyans are impatient with its trickery. It was horrible to hear the President own up to corruption and chide those who aren t partaking of it. The sisi tunakula nyama na nyinyi harurufu wasn t just in bad taste, he said. The president was justifying the it s our time to eat , a crude reminder of what Mzee Jomo Kenyatta told Bildad Kaggia. Uhuru s was an invitation for all of us to join thieving as a national pastime. Mudavadi said Jubilee plots to sabotage IEBC reform and is deceiving Kenyans. The delay in signing the IEBC bills is part of Jubilee s belief that success in governance is through treachery.The sooner Kenyans realise this, the easier it will be to trim its excesses, he said. It is evident the whole exercise was designed to fail. Jubilee is bent on scuttling IEBC reforms.
