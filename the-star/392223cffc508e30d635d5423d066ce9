The JSC is likely to dismiss a petition filed against Chief Registrar of Judiciary Anne Amadi after the petitioner failed to produce the required information.Joseph Njuguna who accuses Amadi of misconduct was required by the JSC to provide more information to the commission close to a month ago but has gone under. Kindly supply us with the copies of the letters referred to in your affidavit....we shall appreciate if we could have the said letters by September 19, 2016, the letter addressed to Njuguna and signed by Fridah Mokaya, the registrar of JSC reads in part.Read: JSC asked to remove Chief Registrar Amadi for incompetenceNjuguna filed the petition with the JSC last month but the commission has not been able to proceed because he has not provided the required evidence to support his claims.In the petition, Njuguna wants the CRJ removed from office for allegedly abusing her powers by issuing a directive to the government printer to publish notices announcing vacancies for the positions of Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice and Supreme court judge.He argued that the affidavit sworn by the CRJ was not in order as the Supreme Court had not delivered its ruling on the retirement case against the Deputy Chief Justice Kalpana Rawal and Supreme Court judge Philip Tunoi.He wants the JSC to determine whether it is in order to have a CRJ who is impartial on matters that affect the commission, whether she falsely swore an affidavit and whether she abused her authority to meddle with the JSC process in the Supreme Court case.Although the JSC can actually go ahead and investigate the matter, city lawyer Edwin Sifuna said that it will be difficult to proceed if the information sought by the commission is crucial to the allegations made against the CRJ. The commission will have no option but to dismiss the petition unless the material they have is enough to prosecute the allegations against the Chief Registrar of Judiciary, Sifuna said. When you allege something, you must be able to demonstrate by cooperating and assisting the commission in its work.
