Traders on the Outer Ring Road have made it almost impossible for the contractor to complete the job on time.Completion of the road had been set for the end of next year. But Transport CS James Macharia said there are delays in relocating infrastructure . He also blamed lack of political goodwill from MCAs. The project is 35 per cent complete, which is lower than previously planned, Macharia said last week. He said the main problem is that this is an urban road, coupled with the slow pace of relocating already existing infrastructure like power, drainage, water and communication line.Traders and residents complain the works have made life hard, because the builders have opened pools of water and traffic pile-ups.The road, from Thika Road to the JKIA will eradicate traffic jams and improve the appeal of real estate and general trade. It will have eight lanes, a lane for the Nairobi Rapid Transit System, 10 footbridges, six underpasses and two interchanges.
