Counties will have to rely more on the national government for development projects because billions of shillings of their allocations is spent on salaries, allowances and administrative costs.According to the Kenya Economic Report 2016, only 10 counties out of 47 have reached the targeted 30 per cent threshold of development spending.It says the approved county allocation for recurrent expenditure was 62 per cent and development was 38 per cent in 2014-15 financial years. However, only 22 per cent was spent on development by the end of last year. Development spending is, therefore, low and counties will largely depend on the national government to initiate development activities, the report reads.Wajir, Turkana, Bomet, Machakos, Murang a, Homa Bay, West Pokot, Tans Nzoia, Kisii and Nyamira are 10 counties that reached the 30 per cent spending threshold on development.According to the report, half of the counties spend less than the average 22 per cent on development. This raises fears it might seriously undermine crucial services.It says huge sums are used on salaries, operations, employee emoluments, goods and services, non-financial and financial assets for county executives and assemblies administrative needs. The low development expenditure is of great concern given the need to enhance provision of basic services to citizens in most counties, the report says.President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Mohamed Mukras, a renowned economic scholar, in 2014 to lead the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis board in conducting the survey.It involved an in-depth assessment of various economic sectors and provides medium-term economic prospects.
