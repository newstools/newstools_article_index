Brookside Dairy is going green after installing solar powered water heating systems at its milk cooling stations to save energy.The systems currently running in Kitale and Sotik raw milk bulk stations and at the Sabatia cooling centre in Eldama Ravine will eventually be adopted across the dairy company's 55 cooling stations, the company said in a statement. We are keen to rationalise our power costs through adoption of clean energy systems in all spheres of our operations," said Brookside director of milk procurement, John Gethi.The milk processor is also advocating for the adoption of biogas by its 145,000 farmers in the contracted country.
