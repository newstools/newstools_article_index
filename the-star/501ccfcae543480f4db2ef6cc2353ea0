A multibillion oil and gas exploration project in Lamu county will begin by March next year.This follows a series of successful seismic surveys conducted in 2012-13 in Pate Island, Lamu East. They confirmed the existence of large quantities of oil and gas deposits.The surveys were conducted by Zarara Oil and Gas Company, a subsidiary of Midway Resources International. The company said it will drill about 102 wells.Manager Peter Nduru said on Sunday in Faza town they have spent Sh1.1 billion on the surveys. He said the second phase will involve sinking wells and it will be more expensive. If a well is to be drilled and completed, the process takes three phases for Sh3 billion. In 2013-14, we dealt with data processing and data interpretation. Indications are that there could be gas. Until drilling is done, we cannot prove the quantity, Nduru said.He said an environmental impact assessment had been conducted and the report handed over to the National Environment and Management Authority.County leaders have welcomed the project. Governor Issa Timamy urged investors to sign an MoU with the county for transparency and accountability. We want proper and constructive engagement. Lamu county will need to be fully involved, he said. Timamy urged the investor to allocate a percentage of revenue to Lamu.
