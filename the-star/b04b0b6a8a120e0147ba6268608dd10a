Jonathan Mueke has threatened to resign as Nairobi Deputy Governor should Evans Kidero be impeached.A motion to impeach Governor Kidero was tabled at the assembly by Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang'wara on Tuesday.Speaker Alex Magelo committed it to the House Business Committee that will allocate it time for debate. In the unlikely event of forcing the Governor from office on grounds of the flawed allegations, we will resign from our offices in the spirit of collective responsibility, Mueke said.Kidero was accused of violating the constitution and misappropriating funds. Nyang'wara said no projects have come to fruition despite the passing of budgets.The deputy defended Kidero as innocent, saying the allegations were false and that some ward representatives quickly condemned him for selfish reasons.Mueke accused the Jubilee government of being behind the motion to impeach Kidero, who is a member of ODM.He claimed the ruling coalition was trying to shake Nairobi politics after failing to find a favourable candidate to get Kidero out of power."Jubilee has proved to be unstable in politics. They are trying to destroy Cord in a very barbaric way. They have presented more than eight candidates so far and yet they have not found a preferred candidate to take down Kidero," he said.He added that the government was bitter because Kidero demanded the billions of shillings it owes the county.Kidero said on September 13 that the national government owes City Hall Sh62 billion from land rates, parking fees and operating licences. The national government doesn t pay for revenues, hasn't been and will not pay. They don t pay for car parking and land they have grabbed from us, he said.He said City Hall will not beg for the money, contrary to a proposal by a member for the government to be petitioned.More on this: State owes city Sh62 billion, Kidero demands paymentKidero's motion was tabled after two episodes of chaos at the assembly - last Thursday and yesterday.Deputy minority leader Ngaruiya Chege, who is Kahawa West MCA, claimed Kidero paid Cord MCAs to disrupt the proceedings last week because he fears the grounds for his removal are genuine.He noted the county's debt has increased from Sh12 billion to Sh42 billion since Kidero's election on March 4, 2013."We shall ensure the motion sails through at all costs," he said.The EACC summoned Magelo and county clerk Jacob Ngwele to shed more light on what caused MCAs to exchange blows at the assembly.More on this: Kidero impeachment motion tabled despite fracas at Nairobi assembly[VIDEO] Nairobi MCAs throw punches as Kidero impeachment motion tabled
