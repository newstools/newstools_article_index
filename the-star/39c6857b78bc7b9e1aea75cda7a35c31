Baringo county commissioner Peter Okwanyo (pictured) on Thursday threatened to resign over what he saw as mockery by residents due to rising crime in Kabarnet town.On Wednesday, residents marched to his office and accused him and his security team of laxity. We ll resign if that will end the biting insecurity, Okwanyo said. He said he had just arrived from visiting victims of banditry in Loruk on the border of Baringo North and Tiaty subcounties.The protesters demanded his immediate transfer or resignation, together with county police commander Peter Ndung u and Kabarnet OCS Sebastian Mulili. They accused the security team of aiding criminals. The protest was sparked by the death of a nine-month-old child, after burglars sprayed chloroform into its parents house before breaking in on Sunday. Residents accused the security team of releasing suspects who had been terrorising them for a month. Civil society crusader Isaiah Biwott said wananchi intercepted the culprits as they transported stolen goods to Nakuru town. We later learnt police released them and offered them protection after they gave Sh2,000 bond each, he said.
