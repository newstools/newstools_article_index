Factions of the Jubilee Party will cause disharmony in the region, the Nakuru Aspirants Caucus has said.CEO Simon ole Nasieku yesterday said the faction of Jubilee led by James Karimi is planning a meeting tomorrow with an agenda to launch the party and rebrand the office in Nakuru.No official of the new JP is in office and communication over leadership is yet to come from the head office in Nairobi, Nasieku said. The members of the caucus urged security agents be on alert and manage factions that might cause disharmony, as witnessed in the former TNA party leadership wrangles. Nasieku added that the Jubilee Party still has no officials at the national level and so no one should rebrand the office in Nakuru.Karimi said the Saturday meeting is official and he has invited all factions. He also wants issues on JP leadership addressed.
