Nairobi MCAs caused drama at the assembly, despite a warning by the speaker, during the tabling of a motion to impeach Governor Evans Kidero.ODM ward representatives earlier tried to block the reading of the motion by Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang'wara, who is a member of the party.They resorted to protests following speaker Alex Magelo's move to suspend Eastleigh South MCA Nelson Masiga for 30 days.Masiga and others in ODM had protested against "tough rules" by the speaker, who prohibited all representatives from booing and shouting at Nyang'wara.He refused to walk out forcing the Sergent-at-Arms to try carrying him to the exit.But his supporters then started chanting "Magelo must go", bringing House business to a standstill.After minutes of a push and pull between the MCAs and the Sergent-at-Arms, Masiga was forced to walk out giving room for the motion to sail through.The Speaker committed the motion to the House Business Committee that will allocate it time for debate.The committee chaired by the speaker has seven days, according to Standing Orders (House Rules), to allocate time for the motion to be debated.The motion requires the support of a third of all members to be tabled. Nairobi county has 127 MCAs so it would take 87 MCAs to impeach Kidero.At least 56 Cord and Jubilee MCAs signed the petition to remove the city boss from officeMCAs affiliated to Jubilee Party earlier asked IG Joseph Boinnet to provide them with maximum security when they table the motion.Minority leader Abdi Guyo, deputy minority leader Ngaruiya Chege and minority whip Hashim Kamau said Kidero might hire goons to attack them during the Tuesday afternoon session."Cord MCA's are currently in a Kamukunji, they are planning to boycott the session. Due to this we fear that goons will be hired to attack us, we ask the IG to ensure that we are protected," said Chege.He said Nyang'wara will sit on the minority side in the chamber for protection.The MCAs request for security follows a fight at the assembly last Thursday when ODM's Viwandani MCA Samson Nyang'wara stood to table the motion.More on this: [VIDEO] Nairobi MCAs throw punches as Kidero impeachment motion tabledChege, who is Kahawa West MCA, claimed Kidero paid Cord MCAs to disrupt the proceedings last week because he fears the grounds for his removal are genuine.He noted the county's debt has increased from Sh12 billion to Sh42 billion since Kidero's election on March 4, 2013."We shall ensure the motion sails through at all costs," he said.Nairobi county assembly speaker Alex Magelo approved the impeachment motion last Thursday.
