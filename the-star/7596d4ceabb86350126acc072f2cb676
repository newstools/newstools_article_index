Later in the morning, he will bring his 1966 Austin Princess limousine to the judging line. Talking about his five car entries, Magdi Riad said: I am preparing these machines for my daughter, Mikaella, because of my deep enthusiasm for cars which appeal to me. This fits the theme of the Concours which is the Spirit of the Machine . The five cars have been restored for the first time for the competition. They will be a credit to the Concours and next year, I will bring them to a higher level. For the 2018 event they will be top flight entries going for major prizes, Magdi declared.Spectators at the Concours will be able to compare the 1966 Austin Princess limousine of Magdi Riad with the 1968 model entered by Nairobi City County which in the past was the official car of the Mayor of the city. They will also be able to watch the judging of a pair of Volkswagen Karmann Ghia coupes.Paul Chemngorem s 1962 VW Karmann Ghia will be up against DJ Adrian s recently restored example made a year earlier.
