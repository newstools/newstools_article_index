Former presidential candidate Jaffer Isaak yesterday said he will run again in 2017 if his supporters agree.He said he will tackle matters that affect Kenyans directly. Jaffer spoke during the launch of his Diligence Development Alliance party in New Muthaiga.He said the previous regimes got their priorities wrong by concentrating on mega projects such as the super highway and the standard gauge railway, while neglecting the main agenda affecting the people. I want to find out what really affects Kenyans. I will do this by visiting all the 47 counties and talk to the low-income earners, he said. He said he has visited 16 counties and will continue to do so before the end of October. Jaffer, is a trained soldier, had run in 2013, but bowed out of the race.He said the party will work with like-minded parties after elections.Jaffer said the party will welcome people who are ready to make hard decisions.He also disapproved of disbanding the IEBC, saying only the head commissioners should be changed, not the commissioners. What guarantee do we have that the new commissioners will get it right? They came in to replace those commissioners, who failed and so did they, Jaffer said.He also criticised the exit package the state plans to pay the IEBC commissioners. Why should you be given a send-off package after failing in your job? We have an attitude problem, Jaffer said. He is set to launch a nationwide campaign to publicise his party.
