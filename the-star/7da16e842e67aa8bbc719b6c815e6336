Teachers this week expect a quicker ruling on an appeal case filed by Clarkson Insurance Brokers concerning the teachers medical cover tender to allow a flawless provision of medical care.Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion (pictured) said teachers should not suffer because of the tender wars. We expect a quicker decision and to get the winner of the tender to sign another contract for teachers, he said. Sossion said he believes the tender was done aboveboard.TSC has one week to sign the medical cover contract.The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority is expected to look into Clarkson s complaint of not having been evaluated after being knocked out on technical grounds. Clarkson quoted the lowest bid of Sh14.7 billion, but was not evaluated after its bid was found to be non-responsive, given that they did not meet a number of mandatory requirements .AON s quotation was Sh15.3 billion for Option 1 and Sh27.3 billion for Option 2, while Liaison quoted Sh16.5 billion for Option 1 and Sh53.8 billion for Option 2.The Star s investigations have established that Clarkson was supposed to provide a bid bond of Sh145 million, but only presented a Sh130 million bond.On the other hand, AoN was required to put up a bid bond of Sh153 million, but managed to present a total Sh280 million, divided as Sh180 million and an extra one of Sh100 million, well above the tender requirements .On September 8, TSC awarded the tender to AoN based on its first year quotation of Sh4.54 billion. Clarkson quoted Sh4.96 billion.TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia said, The one-year tender is subject to renewal for the second and third year upon satisfactory performance and availability of the funds.
