Garissa police have unearthed a crime syndicate that facilitates acquisition of birth certificates, ID cards and passports by non-citizens.Those involved include government officials, businesspeople and brokers. OCPD Aron Moriasi said the mission to unearth the syndicate was made possible with the help of officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations.He termed the development a breakthrough, as it will improve security. Moriasi addressed the press at his office yesterday. We already have three key suspects, whom we are holding for further interrogation. They will help us nab more suspects and get to the bottom of the matter, he said.Moriasi said police carried out investigations before they arrested those involved. The three were arrested separately in Garissa town. Police also raided a business premises within the town and found completed birth and death certificate forms, original ID cards and uncompleted forms signed by different chiefs from Garissa.It is not clear how the documents ended up in the room, but a senior police officer involved in the investigations and who wished not to be identified said it is likely some officials at the registration department and some chiefs are involved in the racket. Sources told the Star those lined up for interrogation include chiefs and registration department staff.Moriasi said those found culpable will be answerable. He termed unfortunate the involvement of government officials. The police boss said the security implications of giving such vital documents to non-Kenyans are dire.
