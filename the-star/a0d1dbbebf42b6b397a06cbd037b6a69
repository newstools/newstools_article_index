Heroic closing over sees Alex bat Kenya to one wicket winAlex Obanda produced a heroic closing over to bat Kenya to a one-wicket victory over Canon South Western Districts (SWD) in the Pool B match of the Africa T20 Cup at the Oudtshoorn Recreation Ground in South Africa.Chasing 152, Kenya needed 18 runs to win off the final six balls after Dane Paterson had bowled a fine penultimate over for the hosts that had seen him take two wickets for two runs.But Obanda, who is making a comeback after being ignored several times by selectors, proved more than equal to the task as he finished the match with a ball to spare, smashing two sixes in addition to three hard-run twos which bordered on the suicidal to finish unbeaten on 89.The opening batsman got four from the first two balls before he set Nelson Setimani, who was trusted for the over, was sent over the ropes to reduce the target to eight in three balls.He got another double on the third ball before securing the match with his sixth six of the match.Kenya got into the situation of needing 18 off six balls when Paterson had reduced Kenya to 134 for 9 with two wickets (Nehemiah Odhiambo and Lucas Oluoch) in three balls.Elijah Otieno added more worry in Kenya s dug out with three consecutive balls to leave Kenya needing 18 off the last over before Obanda took charge.SWD lost the match in the middle overs of their innings when they lost too many wickets and lacked a power hitter to boost their total in the closing overs.Kenya bowlers picked wickets at regular intervals to tame the hosts who had recovered from 8 for one in one over to 47 for 2. Rakep Patel was the toast of Kenya s bowling with 3 for 17.The home side also made too many errors in the field that saw catches put down in addition to conceding too many two s that should have been cut down to singles.The result means that Northern Cape top the pool log with six points followed by defending champions Northerns and Kenya both on 4 and SWD on 2.
