CBA is targeting suppliers and distributors of its corporate customers, traders, manufacturers and entrepreneurs in the growing real estate sector, with a range of differentiated services that suit the dynamic SME customer needs, it said yesterday. We are leveraging on the success in these categories to introduce discernible customer value propositions that will help SME s with easily accessible, affordable and relevant services, CEOJeremy Ngunze said.The bank has also introduced a real-data credit appraisal methodology that reduces the loan processing period to two days. The SME business as we know is very critical to this country in terms of creation of employment and contribution to the country s Gross Domestic Product .The SME business is one area that is specifically showing a lot of potential for growth, Ngunze said.Banks are rushing to tap into the fast growing SME sector which has positively impacted on financial institutions loan books, as they seek to grow their businesses. As an industry we were to commit a certain percentage of our total balance sheet at a minimal as banks, particularly to support youth and SMEs in the sector. As CBA we have committed 10 per cent of our balance sheet, said Ngunze.This is a reflex of the Sh30 billion Inuka programme, ae Kenya Bankers Association s initiative to support small enterprises across the county.The programme was part of the bank s bargaining point to deter the signing of the Banking (Amendment) Bill 2015, which was signed into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 24.It caps interest rates at four per cent above the Central Bank benchmark rate, currently at 10 per cent, a move meant to increase access to credit.The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data shows there are more than 17 million Small Enterprises registered in Kenya, with 98 per cent of the enterprises contributing to 25per cent of the country s GDP and employing up to 50 per cent of the workforce.The Sh807 trillion SME market has been lenders most recent target as they seek to increase credit availability, tailored in products designed for small businesses. We feel we have a role to play in terms of structuring facilities to the businesses that are in this sector, to do their businesses and to grow, Ngunze said.
