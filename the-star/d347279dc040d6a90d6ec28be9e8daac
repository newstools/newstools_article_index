The Amani National Congress is forming a super alliance with Cord and other opposition parties with a view to defeating Jubilee Party next year.Party leader Musalia Mudavadi made the announcement in Langobaya during the second day of his tour of the Coast. He said negotiations are in top gear to get one strong alliance.Mudavadi spoke at Langobaya PEFA Church on Sunday.He said for the opposition to win without any complaints, there has to be a &ldquo;super strong alliance&rdquo; that will win Kenyans&rsquo; support.ANC has always been ready to join other parties and work as an alliance that would emerge victorious, Mudavadi said.&ldquo;We are still in dialogue to come up with a super alliance to win the votes,&rdquo; he said.Mudavadi spoke after Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, who was in the ANC delegation, told Cord leaders to join hands with Amani to form the super alliance if they want to win the general election.He said Cord co-principals Raila Odinga (ODM), Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford Kenya) and Kalonzo Musyoka of Wiper have had many wrangles and infighting which do not place them as the right candidates to challenge President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.&ldquo;Cord should form a super alliance with the Amani National Congress and allow Mudavadi to be the flagbearer since he is the only one who can challenge the Jubilee Party,&rdquo; Agoi said.He said it would be difficult to defeat JP without teaming up against it.&ldquo;Kenyans are beginning to lose faith in Cord. Already more than 40 MPs ditched the coalition. This is a sign that things are not good,&rdquo; the legislator said.His statements come at a time Cord co-principals are fighting over who will be the coalition flagbearer.Each of the three claims he is the best-suited to be the Cord presidential candidate.They are campaigning independently through their parties, while the Jubilee team is intact and ready for the elections.
