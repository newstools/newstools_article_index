Kenya s Harambee Starlet will face Ethiopia in their Cecafa women s championship semi-final on Sunday at the Technical Institute Njeru in Jinja, Uganda.This is after Tanzania won the toss of coin after having settled for goalless draw with Ethiopia. The teams had tied on three points each in pool B prior to yesterday s clash.The other semi-final will thus pit hosts Uganda against Tanzania.Uganda finished second in Pool A with three points thanks to a lone goal by Laki Otandeka in the Thursday clash against Burundi.The Starlets go into their semi-final buoyed by their 100 per cent record having scored 19 goals while picking up the six points from the three matches and are currently favourites for the overall title.However current top scorer Esse Akida anticipates a tough tie against Ethiopia.She said they will give the semi-final match the seriousness it deserves as they court a final position set for Tuesday.Akida has scored five goals in three matches. She was on target twice as Kenya routed Uganda 4-0 last Sunday She scored again on Tuesday as Starlets defeated Burundi 4-0 before scoring a brace on Thursday as the David Ouma coached side whitewashed Zanzibar 11-0 in their last group match. Our 100 per cent performance speaks for itself but we will not be overconfident. Ours has been to take one match at time and we are glad all things are falling in place, said Akida who plays for Spedag women s club in the Kenya Women s Premier league.She added: Ethiopia are a tough side. They beat Rwanda 3-2 in their opening match and they remain unbeaten on paper just as us. The only difference is that, we didn t concede in our preliminary group matches and we hope to extend the good form in the semis. Our objective is to seal a final slot and plan from there. Today is a rest day for the semi-finalists.
