Murang'a residents are split over the construction of the controversial Northern Collector Tunnel project that will drain water from the Aberdare ranges.While a section of the population supported Cord leader Raila Odinga's assertions that the project stops, others said they had no problem with the venture.Those in support of Raila said the silence of the area's seven MPs was alarming. They want the legislators to lobby against the project funded by the World Bank.The group said they were confused on why it seems only Murang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria and a handful of MCAs are supporting the project.Senator Kembi Gitura, who has made public his opposition to the Sh6.8 billion project, is said to be out of the country.Read: Athi Water Board breached court order, says GituraThe residents have taken the campaign against the project to social media, threatening to vote against any leader who does not help in the fight.The 11.8 km tunnel is meant to convey 142,000 cubic metres of water into Ndakaini river for use in Nairobi county.Wairia said on Tuesday that his government fully supports the project, adding the only issue that had cropped up at its start was how locals would benefit.He also accused former Prime Minister Raila Odinga of using the project to earn political points for the opposition in Central.Read: Jubilee's Sh6.8bn secret water project will turn counties to deserts - RailaThe Governor said Raila used reports from local leaders in his statement, and challenged them to come out openly and declare their stand on the project.Also read: Raila using water project to gain political points, Wairia says, defends JubileeMajority leader Peter Kihungi also castigated Raila for claiming the assembly had blocked the construction of the tunnel.Kihungi added that it was wrong for the Cord leader to drag the late environment minister John Michuki's name into the issue.The MCA claimed Michuki fully supported the project and even proposed the construction of a major road passing through the constituencies as compensation.Joseph Kamau, Kigumo MP aspirant, asked the state to explain issues raised to end fears among Kenyans and residents."Proper communication about the project is needed to end the anxiety among the people," he said.Peter Ngugi, a resident living next to the construction site, said the only problem they have with the government is poor compensation.Ngugi said only those whose land is being used for the project have been compensated while many others affected by the tunnel hopelessly wait for the cash."We know plans to draw water from our rivers have been there for decades. We are okay with it because water is a gift from God and should be freely shared," Ngugi said.His sentiments were echoed by John Kuria, a resident from Kinyona village, who only wondered why the government started the works without compensating them first.He also noted that affected locals had agreed on a compensation rate of Sh1.2 million per acre of land but that Athi water Services Board later placed the value at Sh700,000 without consulting.
