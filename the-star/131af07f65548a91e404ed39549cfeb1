Former NYS Finance director Samwel Wachenje was yesterday taken to task to explain why he approved payment of Sh791 million to three contractors for fictitious supplies.Wachenje was at pains to convince MPs why he effected the payment to Form Home Builders, Reinforced Concrete Technology and Roof and All Trading for the purported supply of construction materials.The National Assembly Public Accounts Committee is probing the Sh1.9 billion National Youth Service scandal. Members were told the companies were paid the amount for supplying materials for the construction of a 3.5km road in Kibera.Wachenje told the session led by vice chairman Jackson Rop (Kepkelion West) that he made the payments following orders from his former bosses, including Devolution CS Anne Waiguru, PS Peter Mangiti, NYS director general Nelson Githinji and his deputy Adan Harakhe.He said the three companies allegedly owned by NYS suspect Josephine Kabura did not offer any services. You are telling this committee the contractors were paid millions of shillings for work they had not done and the personnel, machinery used to ferry construction materials and equipment were from NYS? Rop said. I confirm the slum upgrading project in Kibera was done by our officers, our vehicles and machines in collaboration with the Kenya Urban Roads Authority. It is important to establish where the supplied materials came from, Wachenje said.The committee questioned Wachenje s appointment and competence for the NYS job after it emerged he does not hold academic qualifications in Finance.
