Huawei plans to launch live video streaming services in frontier markets, including Kenya.It has vowed to become a significant player in the segment currently dominated by the social media giant Facebook.The Chinese technology company on Tuesday launched the Huawei Live Baze App in Kenya, saying it is targeting the upcoming technology hubs across the world which have not fully embraced live video streaming technology.Huawei Kenya chief executive officer Dean Yu said the live baze app is a live video interactive platform geared to offer live interactions to artists and game players, allowing them to engage and share sneak peak of their daily activities with fans. In the spirit of sharing experiences, Huawei is committed to seeking innovations that have impacted the Chinese markets, repackaging them and introducing them to frontier markets with the aim of creating success stories, Yu said during the launch of the app in Nairobi.The live baze app is almost similar to Facebook Live which was launched in August 2015 as a platform for public figures to broadcast live video to their fans.Facebook Live has since April been made available to all Facebook users.Yu said the Live Baze is available on Google Playstore and users who download it will be able to interact via public, private and voice chats.He said Kenya has eight million smartphones and competes well with other mobile driven markets, offering a good opportunity for business. Huawei sees an opportunity to impact Kenya's tourism, eduction, and entertainment sectors by creating video experiences that allow users to market the country globally, cascade information and learning to every corner of the country as well as creating an additional revenue line for the Kenyan youth, he said.
