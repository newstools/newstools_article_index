West Pokot governor Simon Kachapin has stepped campaigns against Kanu in the county, citing that the independence party has turned into a tribal outfit.He said that he ditched the outfit chaired by Baringo senator Gideon Moi because of dictatorship and frustrations from its leaders."Kanu doesn t listen to members' views. I will drum support for Jubilee Party and ensure that most seats are taken," he said.He accused Kanu officials of sidelining other leaders adding that they cannot represent community interests at the national level."Kanu doesn t support interest of Kenyans at large. The party has turned to be a tribal party that is only in one region," he said.Kachapin, the only governor elected under Kanu, said he is going to mobilise the community to support Jubilee in the 2017 general election."Kanu is small tribal party that cannot unite the Pokot community with the rest of Kenya," he said, adding that Jubilee has the national face the country needs.Read: Ruto will not force my people into one sack like potatoes - Gideon Moi He further said that the community has never benefited from the Kanu leadership since independence.Kachapin accused those imposing Kanu on residents of being ignorant of the county's history."As a community, we shall support the government of the day since many decades we have been left out," he said.Read: Ruto-Gideon Moi rivalry hots up as Kanu plans rallies in Rift "We shall not accept to be left out again during this era of devolution," Kachapin said.He accused area senator John Lonyangapuo of forcing the community to join Kanu for his personal gain.The development mirrors the political supremacy in West Pokot county as Kanu and Jubilee Party try to outdo each other in influencing the region's politics.Governor Kachapin who is also a close ally of Deputy President William Ruto.Also read: I am not Ruto's wife to be forced into Jubilee Party - Gideon Moi
