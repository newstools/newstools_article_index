It was recently reported that Cord plans to name its presidential candidate in January. It was thus an opportune moment for the Star columnist Wycliffe Muga to draw several useful contrasts between the current and previous constitutions about the calculations available to the president (whether a candidate or the incumbent) with regard to choosing a running-mate, whether (as previously) a vice president or (currently) a deputy president ( Cord is very prudent to delay naming flagbearer , says the Star edition of September 24-25 ).However, in his examination of the (more limited) options available to Cord, he ignores one (potentially, at least) crucial option: Collectively fielding multiple candidates, each one raising his appeal in both policy-issue and communal terms.For example, in the current situation, it is clear that most supporters (and thus potential voters) of ODM, Wiper and Ford Kenya are more energised by Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang ula, respectively, than they are by either of the other two.Of course, this reality would have to be at least tentatively verified through survey research. And without knowing, first, who the running mate will be, and, second, how much energy (and material resources) the two disappointed principals will contribute to the candidacy of the anointed one , it is impossible to even begin to determine the level of voter support he would receive.But these calculations rest within another provision of the Constitution that Muga fails to mention: The absolute majority that any candidate must win, failing which a run-off between the top two contenders (and their running mates) is held two months later. Indeed, this is what was avoided in 2013 by only the narrowest of margins: Prior to the Supreme Court s decision removing the invalid votes from the calculation, a mere 8,000 votes out of more than 12 million cast, thus producing an outright win of just 50.07 per cent (which rose to a still minimal 50.5 per cent after that decision).In other words, since every single vote NOT cast for the top finisher in Kenya s presidential elections will count AGAINST the 50%+1 required for such a first round, outright, win, the number of candidates is equally, if not even more, important than the timing issue that Muga highlights.Of course, how this potential strategy is packaged could make a great deal of difference. The presence of a gaggle of opposition candidates on the ballot as a consequence of an overt failure to agree on just one, followed by public recrimination, would likely be much less of a threat to the incumbent than would a cordial, mutually-agreed declaration followed by voter education that the main (and more realistic) goal of the campaign was NOT to achieve an outright, first round win, but to throw the election into a run-off. And beyond Cord, there is the possibility that additional, minor candidates will also come forward, with each vote that they attract serving the same purpose.The extent to which the pro-opposition electorate would accept this strategy is another matter. But without considering it, the factors Muga explores with regard to the timing of the opposition s announcement cannot be fully appreciated.
