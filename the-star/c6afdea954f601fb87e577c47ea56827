When a community allows elders to select leaders to run for election, it enhances unity and cohesion, Garre Council of Elders chairman Haji Ali Noor has said.In the community, the 21 subclans present a list of people they support and the elders then pick the leaders from the list. This fosters unity in Mandera county, he said.Speaking to the press in Mandera town yesterday, Noor said elders will seek to rally the community to support the selected candidates. The list was presented to us by the subclans in the county. What we did was only to pick the best from the group. We did not just wake up and come up with names because doing so would have backfired, he said.Governor hopeful Hassan Noor Hassan, a long-serving provincial administrator, said he would strictly abide by the treaty even if they state that I only run for one term . He spoke to the press separately. Hassan has been chosen by the elders to run for governor.Governor Ali Roba was recently quoted by the media saying that in 2013, they were not informed by the council that they would serve for only one term. Had this been made clear to us during that time, we would have made much more informed decisions since some of us were in the corporate world, he said.Meanwhile, Mandera politicians have been ordered to notify police before holding political meetings.This follows the Takaba meeting that turned into chaos when a new political lineup was read by the elders.County commissioner Fredrick Shisia told the press the law gives guidelines on holding political meetings. You need to notify police 24 hours prior to holding a political meeting so they can provide security, he said.Shisia said police in Takaba controlled the violence and only six people were injured. They are receiving treatment.
