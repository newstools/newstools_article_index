Nominated MP Zuleikha Juma has criticised mining CS Dan Kazungu and Governor Salim Mvurya for concluding a meeting on mining in Kwale before several people could speak. ODM-Jubilee politics played out at a Tuesday meeting. Juma s effort to convince Mvurya to let her speak were unsuccessful. The governor closed the meeting immediately after Kazungu spoke.He had assured residents the government has not issued exploration licence to the Base Titanium Company.Residents are worried about compensation, health risks and damage to the environment. Juma arrived late but said it was her right to ask about problems that have caused tension among residents.She said it was wrong to invite leaders and deny them a chance to speak. County assembly speaker Sammy Ruwa, who recently joined ODM, was also barred from talking. I told Mvurya I wanted to ask Kazungu questions, but he insisted on winding up the meeting, Juma said. Why did they invite me? It was wrong. We re people s representatives. Juma criticised MCAs Michael Mutua and Suleiman Nzala for backing Mvurya s action. How can they say since Mvurya and Kazungu have spoken, everything is okay? she said.Juma blamed the decision on politics, saying most leaders at the meeting were Jubilee-affiliated.She said it is wrong to bring politics into sensitive matters about residents lives.
