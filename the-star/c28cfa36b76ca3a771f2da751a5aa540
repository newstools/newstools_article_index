Setting up a business can be a daunting task. Finding the right location and setting up the working area or office is one of the most draining jobs - both physically and financially - for new entrepreneurs.However, a new idea taking shape in the country is set to ease things for start-ups and business travellers.Mooted by businesswoman Esther Muchemi, the new concept allows entrepreneurs to have fully equipped temporary offices as they start out, complete with a mailbox and support staff, such as cleaners and receptionists, to ease their work.Muchemi says the idea came about during one of her trips outside the country. &ldquo;Some time back I stayed in the UK. I was there for about six months for personal reasons, but I also needed to do some work.I discovered a convenient place where I could sleep on the upper floor and move downstairs to do my office work,&rdquo; says the businesswoman.During her stay, Muchemi was wowed by the fact she could conveniently work and be accomodated at the same venue at a reasonable price.&ldquo;When I came back to Kenya, I replicated the idea,&rdquo; she says.In 2005, Muchemi founded Space International, a mixed-use facility along Tom Mboya Street, Nairobi with five studio rooms, 13 virtual offices, 15 single offices, a few meeting rooms and one large boardroom &mdash; all for rent on a short-term basis.The virtual office has a cyber-style set-up, only that each workstation is a little bit more spacious than at a cyber and other than a desktop, it has a printer and a phone handset.&ldquo;Each of these phones has its own extension number, such that our receptionist will answer the call on a client&rsquo;s behalf and, depending on which company the caller asks for, the call is then transferred to the workstation of the exact business owner,&rdquo; explains Muchemi.For a one-man office, clients are charged Sh35,000 a month for the space, which includes a desk, two visitor chairs, a phone line and secretarial services. In addition, hiring of a meeting room goes for Sh1,500 per hour.&ldquo;We have people who have been here for a few years as they scout for a better location for their grown businesses, because relocating a business requires a lot of planning and you need to take a lot of things into consideration, such as convenience of access to your key clients,&rdquo; Muchemi says.The premises have free WiFi, a key component for any business.The biggest challenge the new business concept faces, according to Muchemi, is the task to weed out briefcase companies that can abuse the system.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get into a situation where someone puts up a temporary business to con people and then leave. That is why we have very strict rules for tenants, and we do due diligence and KYC [Know-Your-Customer],&rdquo; she adds.For an entrepreneur to be given office space at the premises, the business has to be duly registered with all authorities and provide us with a Kenya Revenue Authority PIN.&ldquo;This has been an incubator for so many big businesses in Kenya today. One former tenant is still my friend until today, and when we meet, he always tells people it is because of me that he has made it that far,&rdquo; recounts Muchemi.&ldquo;He is doing serious real estate business and I&rsquo;m proud. Such success stories make this business so worth it,&rdquo; she adds.
