High Court judge Isaac Lenaola has said he will bring back the glory of the Supreme Court if nominated.Lenaola said the court needs somebody Kenyans can trust and not question to run the country's affairs."I will come out strongly if I am picked for the position," he told the JSC vetting panel on Wednesday."The Supreme Court should be held with high regard ... when the Supreme Court speaks, Kenyans should listen."The judge characterised himself as "liberal and pragmatic" and said he wants to be analytical about issues.He noted ICT is an important tool in the fight against corruption and in clearing the backlog of cases in courts. Asked what he will do when he is nominated or when he loses, Lenaola said he will be happy either way."I will be excited when I get the position. Should I not get it, I will be happy that I got the opportunity to be here and I will be comfortable and go back home," he said.Lenaola was interviewed after former CIC commissioner Imaana Laibuta, who said court orders should be obeyed.Laibuta also said the judiciary needs to be independent from the other two arms of the government.He said it should be able to do its work without interference from the executive and the legislature."The judiciary needs to be independent as far as finances and human resources are concerned," he said.But he said the judiciary must remain accountable to Kenyans and Parliament, which is an oversight body.Laibuta gave former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga a seven out of 10 performance rating."The performance was colossal considering he was there for only five years," he said.Asked what animal he would want to be given a chance, he chose the cat saying they are loving and enjoy the warmth of everyone in a home.Laibuta, who is physically challenged, said the judiciary has achieved a lot, especially under the current constitution.He said from evaluations as a CIC member, convoys hailed former CJ Willy Mutunga for achieving a lot in a short period.The Judicial Service Commission is seeking to replace retired judge Philip Tunoi.Tunoi retired in June after a five-judge bench declined to listen to an appeal challenging his retirement. Tunoi had been suspended following allegations that he took a Sh200 million bribe from Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero in an election petition. Other candidates who have been interviewed and considered for the position are Appellate judge Alnashir Visram and High Court judge Mbogholi Msagha.More on this: Supreme Court judge interviews: Visram wants team work, independenceAlso read: Longest serving judge Mbogholi promises to clear backlog of cases
