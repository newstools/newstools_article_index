It s now official that next year s East Africa Secondary School Games will be held in Gulu Uganda and not Tanzania as had been earlier announced.Federation of East Africa Secondary School Sport Association (FEASSA) secretary general David Ngugi said they had settled on Uganda to give Tanzania schools sports body more time to put their house in order.Ngugi, who was speaking in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania over the weekend, where he was on a fact finding mission, said he had successful meeting with the Tanzania counterparts and had settled on 2018 for Tanzania to play hosts. Uganda is definitely our next destination because they seem to be very ready and have organised several successful events in the past, Ngugi said, saying that most countries had problems at the Tanzania borders and would give the Tanzania authorities time to sort out the issues. According to Ngugi, Gulu in Uganda will host the games to allow the students of the regions to sample different towns of the regions.Other Uganda towns which have hosted the games in the past include Kampala, Mbarara, Fort Portal and Lira while Rwanda have hosted the games in Huye and Kigali.Kenya has hosted the regional games in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Kisumu and recently Eldoret while Burundi and Tanzania have hosted the games in Bujumbura and Dar-es-salaam respectively. According to Ngugi, the 2018 edition of the games in Tanzania will not be in Dar and has asked the country s schools sports committee to identify another town in an effort to allow visiting nations to sample other towns of the country.During this year s edition of the games in Eldoret in August, Kenya dominated the events, winning the overall title after accumulating a total 15 gold medals, the highest ever the country has reaped in the past.
