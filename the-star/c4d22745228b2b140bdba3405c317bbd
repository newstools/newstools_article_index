Who is out to embarrass Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu? A signboard (pictured) announcing the construction of the Kirutai-Makutano drift in Taita is doing exactly that. The signboard indicates that the overall supervisor of the project is THIEF OFFICERS WORKS AND INFRAS-RUCTURE . Those who have seen it have been wondering whether it was done in malice or how careless can the person in charge be to make such an error. ***********Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko s activities in Machakos have tongues wagging, with some saying he has changed base from Nairobi for the 2017 elections. Sonko has insisted he will not run for governor in Machakos but in Nairobi. He will face-off with Johnson Sakaja, Margaret Wanjiru and Dennis Waweru for the Jubilee Party ticket. Insiders within Jubilee say Sonko appears to be making a tactical move to Machakos, where he has not only built a home but has spent the last two months doing various activities. He has been meeting local leaders, including MCAs, and participating in fundraisers around the county. Some Ukambani MPs are convinced he may have been talking with former VP Kalonzo Musyoka to get the Wiper ticket as Governor Alfred Mutua has already bolted and formed his own party.***********Leading by bad example? Well, former Internal Security Minister and now Kajiado South MP Katoo ole Metito was seen alighting from a Toyota Prado GKB 588F near County Hall whose windscreen had numerous and glaring cracks. Ordinarily, and as per the traffic rules, the vehicle would not pass a police roadblock. So what happened? Or did Metito use his clout to pass the many police roadblocks? Or is it that police hardly inspect the condition of GK vehicles on the roads? Metito is the Jubilee Coalition s Chief Whip in the National Assembly, with considerable influence.***********An MP from Vihiga county, Western Kenya, was forced to take to his heels as fast as he could after a meeting he was addressing backfired. Corridors has it that the first-term MP, who is well-built, feared being roughed up by the supporters of his rival after initially overruling his handlers that he reschedules the meeting for another day. Those who witnessed the drama now wonder why a man who has been chest-thumping about his grassroots connections would be silenced and forced to flee from a function he had organized. The man, who rarely makes contributions to business in the House, is also known to frequently brandish his firearm recklessly.
