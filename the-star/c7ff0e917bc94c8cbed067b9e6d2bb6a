NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo has defended the commission against claims of ineptitude and accused Kenyans of fueling tribalism.In its latest survey, the commission reported that the JSChd not adhered to directions on employment, stipulated in section 7(2) of the National Cohesion and Integration Act."I am very discouraged by Kenyans. I think they fan ethnicity... I am creating an opportunity for people to be ashamed of tribalism," Kaparo said during a Citizen TV interview on Wednesday.Kaparo said leaders should dispense of tribalism as soon as possible, with the public's help."If they do this it will be better for the country," he said. "Interesting is that there is no county in Kenya that has only one ethnic group. I urge every leader to look for the marginalised communities; they too have something to contribute to the nation."Read: Kenya will commit suicide if it creates ethnic statesThe chairman said Kenyans should shy away from tribalism for peace to prevail.He cited Kenya Scouts, with whom he said they signed a memorandum of understanding for the Messengers of Peace programme.
