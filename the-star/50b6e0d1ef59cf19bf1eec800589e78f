Some 100 pastors from Gatundu subcounty on Saturday held prayers for peace as the country heads to the general election. The On our knees for our country event was organised by the Gatundu Pastors Forum and Kiambu Peace campaigners. No investor will put his or her money in a place where peace is elusive and as the church we have a role in rallying Kenyans to cry to God to grant us peace, Forum chairman Pastor Peter Kamau of Emmanuel Worship Centre said. We are comforted by the words of our President and Deputy President, who have vowed that the next elections will be held in a peaceful environment. All we are doing is echoing the voice of our President. He called on the clergy throughout the country to hold similar prayers and erect altars of peace in every subcounty. Hadija Wangari of Jamia Mosque, Nairobi, urged Kenyans to refuse to be divided across religious lines and unite in defence of their Motherland. The pastors later erected a peace pillar in the Gatundu deputy county commissioner s compound.
