Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday said he does not regret his confrontation with President Uhuru Kenyatta during former Heritage minister William ole Ntimama s funeral.He said the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Committee report detailing historical land injustices should be implemented in Ntimama s honour.Raila said Ntimama championed social justice, national reconciliation and cohesion. He said the TJRC report will bring justice to Kenyans hurt by land grabbing, massacres, disappearances and marginalisation. I raised the TJRC issue as a matter of conscience. I did it as a duty to my country and as part of my deep belief that historical injustices have occurred in Kenya and they need to be addressed as recommended in the original TJRC report, Raila said from Germany in a statement to media houses. I have no apologies on this matter and I promise to continue raising it. It was important that as we buried Ntimama, we remind the national leadership of its unfinished agenda that must be acted on, he said.Uhuru told off Raila during Ntimama s burial. He told the Cord leader to keep off Jubilee s affairs. Raila had said Ntimama had not defected to Jubilee. He said the report s recommendations legal and institutional land reforms, tackling poverty, unemployment among youths, inequality, accountability, impunity, achieving national cohesion and unity - are critical for a better nation. This report has always been shrouded in controversy. Foreign members of TJRC committee refused to sign it when some sections were expunged on instructions of some influential figures in government, Raila said.
