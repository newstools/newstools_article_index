ODM filed a suit on Tuesday in a bid to compel the registrar of political parties to disburse Sh 5.1 billion due to it ahead of 2017 general election.Under a certificate of urgency filed at the Milimani High court, ODM said the failure by the registrar to release the Sh 5,109,564,700.53 has crippled its preparation for the scheduled polls.The party said that the action of the registrar withholding the funds, lawfully due to it under the Political Parties Fund, is illegal.ODM has accused the registrar of high-handedness and not following procedures by failing to consult, inform and give reasons for not disbursing the monies.Through lawyers Julie Soweto and James Orengo, the party said its capacity to prepare, participate meaningfully and effectively in campaigns has been greatly affected.The lawyers said the registrar has released only an estimated 0.03 per cent of the National Revenue collected towards the fund. "ODM has a right and is entitled under section 25 of the Political Parties Act, to receive funds from the PPF. A decision whether jointly or severally to disburse funds less than what the law stipulates is illegal, ultra vires and unconstitutional," Orengo said.The party has also listed Jubilee Party, The National Alliance Party and the United Republican Party as interested parties in the suit.According to the party, there is no basis, lawful authority, rationale or reasonable justification as to how the registrar chose or decided to distribute only 0.03 per cent or an amount less than the total amount stipulated by law. The lack of such rationale evidences the absence of any or any valid reasons"The amount being not less than 40 per cent of 95 per cent of not less than 0.3 per cent of the total revenue collected by the national government during the period between 2011 and 2016 less the sum of Sh501,575,919.00 which has been received by ODM during the same period," the party said. In addition, ODM says because of underfunding, it has been unable to undertake its core mandate and to utilise the funds to which it is entitled by law."The failure to release the monies undermines democracy, the rule of law, and the objectives for which the fund was established," the party adds.ODM argues that Kenya is a multi-party democratic state therefore the failure and refusal to disburse all the funds due to it and other political parties undermines the constitution.They cited sovereign power of the people and democratic governance as some of the principles that the registrar should be surcharged for not adhering to."Furthermore, the right of citizens to make political choices guaranteed under Article 38 of the constitution are also contravened and undermined," the Orengo and Soweto suit says.Read: Cash-starved ODM seeks to raise funds from its supporters and aspirantsAlso read: ODM claims Jubilee prints cash, steals funds for party launch
