He said sheikhs and imams will benefit more after the registration is completed. The process will generally help the government, the Islamic leaders council, the sheikhs and imams themselves, Bajaber said.Easy identificationHe said after the registration, the government will identify leaders at the mosques. He said this will end cases of mosques being used as recruiting and radicalisation grounds by terror cells.In 2013, police raided mosques following information that youths were being recruited. Weapons and al Shabaab flag were recovered.Early this year, a madrassa in Likoni was closed after police suspected the teacher of radicalising the children.Held responsibleAnother madrassa teacher was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a Mombasa court for radicalising children at a mosque in Kilifi county.
