Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa yesterday urged the multi-agency team investigating a syndicate of container theft at the Mombasa port to conclude its job.The multi-agency team comprises officials from Kenya Revenue Authority, Kenya Ports Authority, Directorate of Criminal Investigation and National Security Intelligence officers. It is investigating the alleged disappearance of containers. Marwa spoke during the official launch of the 2016 Taxpayers Month at Forodha House, Mombasa. He said provisional reports indicate more than 120 containers went missing. The battle is not yet over. I m concerned if not disturbed by the recent events at the port, Marwa said in a speech read on his behalf by Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki. He said the report will help bring culprits to book. I wish to direct all agencies represented at the port to intensify their collaboration. This is the only way to win the war against supply chain security challenges, Marwa said.In August, the Kenya Revenue Authority unearthed a tax evasion scam at the port, involving fraudulent clearance of cargo that leads to revenue losses. Several KRA and KPA officials have been arrested and charged in court with conspiracy to evade tax through irregular clearance of containers. Police officers have been found to be part of the cartel. KRA Commissioner-General John Njiraini said the scheme was discovered when Customs officials were reconciling containers meant for auction.
