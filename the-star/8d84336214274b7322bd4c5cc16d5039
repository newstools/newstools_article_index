Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has been asked to step down from the 2017 race over his "poor development record".Aspirant Eric Rabuogi said Midiwo has done nothing tangible for the last 15 years he has held the seat."You have failed the people of Gem and the honourable thing to do for them is to step down for young, visionary leaders," Rabuogi said on Tuesday.He accused the MP of unfair distribution of CDF money and challenged him to show residents what projects he has implemented during his tenure.Rabuogi, a businessman, noted that many residents were still living in poverty due to the MP's constant politicking.He asked residents to send Midiwo home and vote for leaders who can change their lives.Read: Irate Siaya youths attack Midiwo, smash car windows in Rasanga defenceThe politician who defected from Jubilee to ODM expressed confidence that he will defeat Midiwo in the nominations.He said he is assured the exercise will be free and fair as stated by party leader Raila Odinga."The 2017 election will not be about who is close to the party leader but who has and can deliver to the people," he said.Rabuogi also asked leaders from Nyanza to focus on issue-based politics that can spur development and economic growth in the region.Midiwo, who is a cousin to Raila, has in the past come out strongly to defend his development record.He has been Gem MP since 2002.
