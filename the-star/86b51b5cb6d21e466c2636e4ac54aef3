Nangina ward representative John Obwogo has accused police of abetting crime. He said crime is on the rise because officers who have been posted at Nangina police station for so many years are colluding with criminals. Whenever hardcore criminals are arrested and arraigned before court, they are later set free, Obwogo said. Some of the security officers at Nangina police station have stayed here for many years. I want to urge the county police boss to move with speed and transfer the officers to other stations. He was addressing the press at Funyula on Wednesday. Obwogo said the officers have sired illegitimate children with local women. The police officers at Nangina police station also claim they do not have fuel for their vehicles, he said. Obwogo said crime has reached alarming levels and is out of control.
