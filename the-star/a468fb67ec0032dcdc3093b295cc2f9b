Lowasa (pictured) will battle it out with incumbent Mathew Lempurkel of ODM and nominated MP Sarah Lekorere of URP.Edung will defend the seat for the third time. Both leaders will run on the Jubilee Party ticket. Lowasa said his agenda is to stop the vetting Turkanas are subjected to on suspicion some of them are involved with terror groups.
