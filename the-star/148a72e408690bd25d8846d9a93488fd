The estranged wife of a KAA employee and three others who were charged with attempting to kill him have been granted bail.Bilha Njoki (wife), Lucy Njeri, Peter Kakungi and Jimmy Waititu appeared at Makadara law courts on Tuesday.Chief magistrate Heston Nyaga released them on Sh500,000 cash bail or Sh1 million bond each.The four denied the charge of jointly hiring hitmen to kill Joseph Muraya at Mowlem estate in Embakasi on June 22.They are facing another charge of conspiring to kill Muraya on the same date.The suspects had been detained after the prosecution objected to their release on bond saying they would abscond."The life of the complainant is in danger as the first accused is his wife. He fears that if released she might complete her mission," the prosecution had added.The team had also said the four needed to remain in custody to serve as a lesson to others as the crime has become rampant.Defence lawyers asked the court to release the suspects saying the case is a family matter. They also said witness protection programmes are available.Police said Njoki hired hitmen to kill her husband but that police laid a trap and made arrests after gathering sufficient evidence.The hitman was to be paid Sh500,000 but the woman had given a Sh100,000 down payment.The remaining Sh400,000 was found in a car she was in with her sister before she was arrested. It was to be paid after confirmation that her husband was dead.More on this: KAA worker's wife charged with conspiring to kill himThe case will be mentioned on July 15.
