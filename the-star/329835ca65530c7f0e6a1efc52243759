The EACC has urged MPs to regulate M-Pesa money transfer services to help fight corruption.CEO Halakhe Waqo on Thursday said public servants, particularly police officers, are enriching themselves from bribery through unregulated mobile phone money transfer services . M-Pesa and other mobile phone money transfer services need to be looked into in terms of legislation that does not hurt users to help curb corruption, Waqo told a parliamentary committee. He said the EACC three-month survey into questionable M-Pesa transactions early this year among traffic police officers revealed the highest received Sh7.7 million while the lowest officer had Sh129,000.
