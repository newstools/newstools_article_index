A woman has said she wants to run for Kiambu governor governor, a post that has previously attracted just men.Aquiline Gathendu, an IT specialist, announced her candidature at Ruiru town on Saturday.She said she will be locking horns with incumbent William Kabogo and Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu next year.Gathendu said she will run on a Jubilee ticket, the same party Kabogo and Waititu want to use to run for governor. I will give them a run for their money because I m confident that I will beat them, she said.Gathendu said that her bold move to face the "two political giants" in the competition was triggered by the urge of bringing "real change" in governorship and administration in Kiambu. We have a lot of resources in our county, but still we are lagging behind in development because of poor leadership, she said.Gathendu said she wants to improve agriculture and upgrade dilapidated roads, and grow the county's economy."I will also create a conducive environment for investors and traders, which is currently lacking," she said.
