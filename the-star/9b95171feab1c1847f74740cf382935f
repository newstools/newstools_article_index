Residents of several Nairobi estates have threatened to march to the water company's offices in protest against continued water shortage despite maintenance work.Among those who lack water despite two-day repairs last week are residents of Umoja 1 and 2, Dandora Phase 1, Donholm, Buru Buru Phase 4, South B and other areas of Eastlands.The repairs covered the Gigiri reservoir outlet valve, which was to be reinstalled, the Ngethu treatment plant and the transmission pipeline between Ngethu and Gigiri reservoirs.Supply was cut off at 6am on Thursday and restored on Saturday but residents still experiencing shortage said they have had to buy water from vendors. We expected water to have been restored by Saturday morning but our taps are still dry," said one living in Umoja."We do not know whether to buy water or food. It is even worse for us because vendors have increased the price of water, which makes it hard for poor families."Another said: I am unable to operate my small hotel because I don't have water to prepare food, wash utensils or offer my customers to drink after meals. This has led to huge losses yet this is my main source of income. The people urged the county government to intervene saying Eastlands residents always receive water last after repairs by the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company.NCWSC corporate affairs manager Mbaruku Vyakweli asked those lacking water to contact the company."After maintenance thereare airlocks in pipes but these clear in less than a day," he told the Star by phone on Monday.
