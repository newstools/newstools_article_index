Juja MP Francis Waititu wants a Ruiru land agent arrested for allegedly illegally selling 20 acres belonging to a widow.The MPs said despite the woman reporting the matter to the police, the agent is still ignoring summons to record a statement at Juja DCI headquarters. I wonder whether the DCIO, who was recently posted to Juja from Ruiru, has been compromised. Otherwise, how can anyone disobey police summons? he said.Waititu gave the police 14 days to arrest the agent or he said he will petition Parliament. He spoke after addressing members of the Uhuru Welfare Association at Juja Deliverance Church Hall on Saturday. Waititu issued 100 title deeds. Association secretary general Bishop Benson Karanja urged members to pay for their land to be surveyed.
