The family of the Malindi doctor who was arrested at dawn on Friday for allegedly having links with ISIS terrorism gang has dismissed the claims.Maimuna Fazini, wife of Alin Abdigan, 35, condemned the security officers for raiding their home with the brutality that they experienced on the said night.She said Abdigan is a government official working at the Malindi hospital and has never shown signs of working with terrorists, leave alone being one.Family members said he has been present all through and on Thursday came home at 10.30pm from work.His wife said that the officers did not find any weapon and took away phones, an iPad, passports, a laptop, memory cards, and SIM cards.Fazini told journalists at their home that they thought thugs had invaded their house, only to come face to face with the heavily armed security officers.She said the more than 40 officers in military uniform, reportedly in the company of FBI officers, broke doors of three rooms in the 6-bedroom block."We appeal to the government even if they suspect someone they should not destroy property," she said.Members of the family, who live directly opposite the Malindi sub-county hospital mortuary, said they are still in shock from the way police treated them during their kin's arrest."They found us standing by the door of one of the rooms and ordered as to kneel down which we did and they handcuffed us," she said.Abdiqan lived with his mother-in-law, as well as his sisters-in-law who were at the house at the time of his arrest.Read: Former Malindi hospital doctor arrested for suspected links to ISIS
