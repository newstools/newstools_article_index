Throughout this time, Kenya has stood with Somalia, provided a safe haven for refugees, joined peacekeeping missions and invested resources in combating al Shabaab and its affiliates, he said. It is in this context that the government of Somalia has strongly expressed willingness to receive its citizens. Kenya has committed $10 million (Sh1 billion) in new money to support the safe, dignified and orderly repatriation of more that 400,000 Somali refugees in Kenya. But Ruto complained that the international community has not matched these efforts; he noted the European Union cut support to Amisom by 20 per cent this year. He further pointed out that in the case of repatriation since 2012, the international community pledged $500 million (Sh50.6 billion) but that only two per cent of the money has been received. The failure of the solidarity has placed a disproportionate burden on Somalia s neighbours and risks undermining the credibility of international institutions," he said.Ruto also spoke on South Sudan, noting with concern that recent developments threatened to plunge the country and the region into a security and humanitarian crisis.He called upon parties that signed the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict to honour their commitments and work towards its full implementation.The DP said the history of conflict resolution demonstrates that regional mechanisms are the best for sustainable outcomes.He added that it is imperative for the international community to channels its efforts and support through Igad. This is the only basis for durable peace and reconciliation in that beleaguered country, he said.Read: Closing down Dadaab won't make Kenya safeThe Deputy President also noted that Kenya has continued to play an active part in leading international efforts for sustainable solutions to global challenges.He noted the country has hosted three important international conferences to this effect. These include the United Nations Environmental Assembly in May, that discussed current challenges to global environment.In July, Kenya hosted the 14th session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Tokyo International Conference on African Development in August, alongside Japan and other stakeholders. The conference addressed specific concerns on how to speed up economic growth, investment and development in Africa in order to help eradicate poverty and promote shared prosperity," he sadid. We forged good outcomes from all the conferences and I have no doubt that if implemented fully, each of the recommendations made would go along way in transforming our world."He spoke during a reflection session on the United Nations' 71 years of existence in New York, USA.Ruto expressed confidence that the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will transform societies, improve environmental and climatic conditions and sustain global economic growth. He observed that remarkable achievements have been made by the Global Fund in tackling Malaria, HIV/Aids and tuberculosis adding it was for this reason that Kenya pledged $5 million (Sh506 million) towards the 5th Global Fund Replenishment. On regional matters, the DP expressed concern that security threats, including terrorism and radicalisation threaten to roll back gains.He added that in the horn of Africa, these factors along with ecological fragility and natural disasters in the face of scarce resources, have complicated the pursuit of development.
