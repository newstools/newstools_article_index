ODM leader Raila Odinga has scheduled a series of activities with youths in what appears to be an elaborate strategy to win their support for his 2017 presidential bid.The activities, according to the organisers, will also provide a platform to register new voters.On Friday, the ODM leader is scheduled to address more than 20,000 youths at a party dinner in a Nairobi hotel."Already 9,000 youths have confirmed to attend the Friday dinner and we expect the number to double since it s still very early," secretary general Agnes Zani said on Thursday.Read: Raila meetings with youth attract state surveillanceThe meetings will also be crucial for Raila to set the opposition agenda, understand the status (economic, political and social) of the nation and create room for supporters to engage him in a one-on-one environment."The activities are run by the ODM youth league and are meant to directly involve the young people on issues affecting them such tribalism, bad governance, nepotism, corruption and poor service," Zani said.Raila held his first Kikao forum in Mombasa county, which attracted 5,000 youths, followed by Kakamega where 6,000 people attended. The Kisii forum is being organised by businessman Antony Kibagendi."The Forum is not an ODM party event, Kikao is an independent initiative that is looking at creating a platform where the youths of various regions or counties get to have a one on one engagement with the Presidential candidate," he said."They will ask him questions about our history, where we are now as a nation in terms of investment in our youths, and what Raila's government has in store for them, particularly because the Jubilee government gave huge promises to young people only for them to realise it was their regular lip service," Kibagendi said..The team will then head to Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula s home turf followed by Nairobi county as it slowly covers all the counties in the country. "Our activities are meant to bring together our communities at grassroots to meet the party leaders so that we can move ahead as a team to win the next elections," Kibagendi said.Describing the party as a dynamic institution attracting all ages, Zani said the party was also engaging other people in the country."We are not just focusing on the youths but we also have plans in place for everyone in the society," She said.Also read: Respect Raila, Nairobi ODM youths demand
