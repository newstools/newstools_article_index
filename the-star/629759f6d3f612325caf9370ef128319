The Nairobi county has petitioned the Senate to intervene and have the national government clear a Sh66.5 billion debt it owes City Hall.In a statement read by director of communications Walter Mong are yesterday, Governor Evans Kidero said the county will take legal action and clamp all government premises that have not paid up, if the debt is not settled immediately. Our demands will be escalated to the next level through legal means and withdrawal of services to non-complying institutions, he said.Kidero said Nairobi hosts the national government and its facilities on about 40 per cent of its total area. Our operations are greatly affected by the acts of the national government, he said.Kidero said the county signed an agreement on how the accumulated debt could be cleared with the national government in 2013, but the government has not been responsive. By the Constitution, legislation and sheer good sense, the national government is required to pay for services enjoyed by its facilities in the city. The revenue from the private sector is simply not enough to finance the services expected by residents, he said.The Office of the President, office of the Deputy President, Defence ministry, Parliament, the Government Press and Transport ministry are some of the government institutions with huge outstanding land rates arrears.OP (Harambee House) owes Sh63.9 million, while DP William Ruto s Harambee House Annex has not paid Sh125.8 million.The Defence ministry is yet to clear Sh60 billion, while the Parliamentary Service Commission owes City Hall Sh48.6 million.Others are the Judicial Service Commission, which has not cleared (Sh93.8 million), Kenya Police Service (Sh70.5 million), Central Bank of Kenya (Sh48.7 million) and the High Court (Sh390,000). Other institutions that are in the county s bad books are the Treasury (Sh8.8 million) and the National Security Intelligence Service, which owes Sh20.2 million.City Hall has in the past clamped private premises, among them five-star hotels and business centres over huge debts.Some of them have, however, cleared the debt and the clampdown sign boards were removed.On Monday, chief administration officer and the chairman of the county revenue enhancement task force John Ntoiti said the clamping was to start but the exercise was cancelled.A source at county headquarters told the Star the clamping will start at Parliament Buildings, before moving to other premises.
