It is said don't count your chicks until they are hatched. However, sometime back, an ODM legislator from Nyanza could not be guided by this wise adage. The man, who has since fallen out with his party boss, had the audacity to go to his the leader's home to borrow chairs, saying that he had a big event to celebrate at his home. Unknown to his boss, the man was granted his wish. He was planning for a big party in the hope that he was going to be appointed a Cabinet Secretary during last year's reshuffle. His visitors and voters waited for the big day that never came. When the reorganisation of the Cabinet was made, the man's name was nowhere. His only consolation was that he had not revealed the nature of the "grand ceremony" to which thousands had been invited.**********A recently appointed director of a parastatal board based in the Rift Valley has taken it upon herself to disparage the management of the organisation with the sole intention of creating doubt about their competence. The director, who is planning to contest for a political seat at the next general election, is reported to be interested in causing scenes so as to receive kickbacks to fund her campaigns next year. She has been so abrasive that she is telling all and sundry of her plans and how she has connections to the top leadership.**********Could Baringo Senator Gideon Moi be planning something politically extraordinary? Well, Corridors has it that, given what has been happening in his social circles, insiders say he is planning something big. He has apparently assembled a media team led by a top TV personality and will be rolling out his campaign plan very soon. If you are wondering what the man is up to, keep it here - because Corridors will unveil everything as and when it happens. **********The honeymoon is indeed over for the politicians who defected from Cord to the Jubilee Party. Corridors has it that though the majority of the politicians crossed over in the hope that they will be given a direct nomination ticket, this is not quite the case. They have been told they will have to battle it out with others within the party and whoever wins carries the day. They have been taken aback, especially with President Uhuru Kenyatta's declaration that the IEBC will conduct the nominations. They have a sneaking feeling JP may be using the IEBC when it already has its own preferred men and women for the party ticket.
