Coast politicians should support Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho s presidential ambition in 2022, Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba has said.Joho, whose political star is rising fast, has positioned himself as the undisputed Coast political supremo.The ODM deputy party leader says he will campaign for Cord co-principal Raila Odinga s election next year, but in 2022 he will battle it out with Deputy President William Ruto for the top seat.Joho has single-handedly organised ODM rallies. Last weekend, he was in Kisumu to sell the party manifesto and to campaign for Raila.But Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar has brushed off his ambition as a piped dream, which shall never become a reality . Bedzimba said Joho has all the qualities to become President. He spoke on Thursday at Mtopanga Primary School, when he gave out bursary cheques for Sh26.2 million to 5,000 students in Kisauni. Central people nurtured Uhuru to become President, Nyanza nurtured Raila to become Prime Minister and who he is today and Eastern nurtured Kalonzo to become Vice President. What does the Coast has to show? he said. It is our time now to support Joho so that our very own son can be president.
