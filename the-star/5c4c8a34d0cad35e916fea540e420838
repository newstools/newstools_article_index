Wiper delegates in Mombasa on Monday urged Senator Hassan Omar and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti to work together to claim Mombasa s top seat.Awiti and Omar have both declared candidacy for governor.More than 200 delegates met at Royal Court Hotel. They said Omar and Awiti should merge to form a formidable force that will trounce the incumbent Hassan Joho.Joho has positioned himself as the undisputed Coast political supremo. In the last few weeks, he has hosted the ODM 10th anniversary celebrations in Mombasa and headed to Nairobi to campaign for Cord chief Raila Odinga. He also accompanied the opposition chief in his Taita Taveta tour.To counter ODM s rallies at the Coast, Wiper leaders organised rallies in Mombasa on Saturday and Sunday.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka is expected to attend.The Wiper delegates met to draw up strategies on Kalonzo s Mombasa tour.Alexander Muva said, You are both going for the governor seat. We wish you could team up so that we do not lose any of you. Omar and Awiti did not rule out possibilities of a merger. They said democracy will prevail.An Omar-Awiti merger would be a force to reckon with, since Awiti comes from the majority Luo and Omar enjoys the natives support. The residents have agreed that ours is a formidable force, but let me assure you after the next year s general election, Mombasa will have a Wiper governor, Omar said.He said they will agree on how to ensure Wiper clinches the governors. This is a matter that needs deep consultation. Let us first focus on Saturday s tour. All other issues will be sorted out as we head to the polls, Awiti said.
