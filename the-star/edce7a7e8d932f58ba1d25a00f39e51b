Governor David Nkedianye on Thursday evening was whisked away by his security detail following a scuffle with Jubilee Party supporters in Mosiro, Kajiado county.He was forced off the dais after his speech was cut short during a fundraiser for Mosiro women at Oldorko Secondary School.Nkedianye attended the fundraiser uninvited. It was organised by JP s Jonathan Koroine, who is the party s flagbearer for the October 26 Mosiro ward by-election. Nkedianye angered the crowd t when he urged them not to vote for Koroine because the government has neglected the county. Those who have come to raise funds for you are messengers of doom and cannot be trusted. They will ask for votes and you will never see them after election, he said. At this point Kajiado West MP Moses Sakuda shouted at him, telling him to respect them. Nobody has provoked you to warrant such an attack, he said.
