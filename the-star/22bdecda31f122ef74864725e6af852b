The 47 county assemblies have filed a petition in the Senate seeking nullification of policy directive by the National Treasury restricting them on the changes they can make to governors spending plans.In the petition filed yesterday, the Society of Clerks At-The Table (county assemblies) has told senators to annul certain regulations of the Public Finance Management (County Governments Regulations , 2015).The regulations issued by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich last year limited MCAs allocations to a maximum of seven per cent of funds given to devolved units every financial year or twice the personal emoluments of respective county assemblies whichever is lower. Rotich argued the regulations would help reduce excess spending by county governments.
