The debate over the controversial Sh6.8 billion Northern Water Collector Tunnel rages on, but the seven Murang a MPs are mum.Their silence has caused confusion among residents, some of whom are strongly against the project and want the leaders to lobby against it.Senator Kembi Gitura, who has previously made public his opposition to the project, is said to be out of the country.Residents have taken to social media, threatening to vote against any leader who does not help to stop the project.The 11.8km-long tunnel is funded by the World Bank at Sh6.8 billion and is meant to convey 142,000 cubic metres of water into Ndakaini River for use in Nairobi county.Governor Mwangi Wairia on Tuesday said the Murang a government supports the project.He accused Cord leader Raila Odinga of using the project to introduce opposition politics in Central.Wairia said the opposition leader had used reports written by some local leaders in his statement and challenged the leaders to come out openly and declare their stand on the project.Assembly majority leader Peter Kihungi criticised Raila for claiming that the assembly had blocked construction of the tunnel.It is wrong for Raila to drag the name of former Transport minister John Michuki into the issue, he said.Michuki fully supported the project and even proposed the construction of the Mau Mau road that snakes through all the constituencies as compensation, Kihungi said.Resident Peter Ngugi, who lives near the construction site of the tunnel at Makomboki, said the only problem they have is poor compensation.Only the people whose land is on the site have been paid. The others affected by the tunnel wait for their turn, he said. We know plans to draw water from our rivers have been there for decades and we are okay with it because water is a gift from God and should be freely shared, Ngugi said.John Kuria, a resident from Kinyona village, questioned why the government started building the tunnel before it compensated all those affected by the construction.He said residents had agreed on a compensation rate of Sh1.2 million per acre, but the Athi Water Services Board later lowered the amount to Sh700,000 per acre.
