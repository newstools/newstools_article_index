MPs John Waluke (Sirisia) and Paul Otuoma (Funyula), who decamped from ODM, skipped Ababu Namwamba's LPK launch on Thursday night.Ababu, who is Budalang'i MP, quit his ODM secretary general post alongside Otuoma who was vice chairman.[AUDIO] Ababu resigns as ODM secretary general, narrates Raila Odinga's betrayalIt had been said the three were behind the 'mulembe consciousness' movement aimed at uniting Western residents and securing their place in politics.But following their absence at the launch in Nairobi, Ababu wrote on Twitter: "Cowards never write history...not even footnotes. History is written by the edge of the sword of valour."It is not clear whether he wrote this on Friday, after unveiling Labour Party of Kenya, in reference to his 'missing friends'.Otuoma and Waluke did not answer calls and messages for comment.The relaunched LPK, which is the third political force the MP had been speaking about, will run under the slogan 'Haki na Usawa', meaning justice and equality."The Surest way to end ethnic hatred that feeds deep fissures amongst Kenyans is to be just, fair and equitable to each other," Ababu also wrote.The MP's much-hyped force suffered a setback on September 7, when Otuoma and Waluke abandoned him for other political outfits.Source close to the former ODM secretary general said his political activities slowed down following the moves.Waluke said he had officially crossed over to the ruling coalition (Jubilee Party), for his people's benefit. The MP was ODM's only legislator in Bungoma.Read: Ababu s third force on brink of collapse as MPs abandon courseAbabu was the firebrand of ODM party, whose leader is opposition chief Raila Odinga.His political plans have left many confused and Raila leaning towards Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.The MP said he wanted to unite Western and create a "third force" distinct from both Cord and Jubilee to promote the region's agenda.He described the new party as "refreshed with a social justice ideology" and said "it is all about equality, integrity and oneness" .More on this: Ababu launches 'Third Force', to work with Julia Ojiambo's Labour Party of Kenya
