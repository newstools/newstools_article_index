Accountants have asked the National Treasury to review the income tax law to ease tax administration. Through their Institute of Certified Public Accountants Kenya, they said the move will improve revenue collection.While commending the Kenya Revenue Authority's iTax platform, Icpak expressed concern with continued abuse of public funds and challenges in income tax administration."The recently released Auditor General's report indicates that for the financial year 2014-15, out of the audited 108 financial statements, only 27 had an unqualified audit opinion, 51 had qualified audit opinion, 19 had an adverse opinion, while 11 had a disclaimer of opinion," said Icpak's vice chairman Julius Mwatu.
