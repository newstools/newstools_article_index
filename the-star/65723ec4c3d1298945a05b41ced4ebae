Mwingi North men have been told to stop preying on schoolgirls and instead seek their mothers.MP John Munuve on Sunday said, It beats logic why grown-up men would have affairs with young school girls while the girls mothers and other women are available.This trend should not be allowed to continue in my area. Any man who has an affair with a schoolgirls belongs in jail. I want chiefs to make sure they are not compromised and all such wayward men are taken to Kyuso court for onward transmission to the Waita GK prison, he said.
