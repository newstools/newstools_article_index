It has been all fun and games for gospel singer Bahati, till this morning when the former inspector general of police, David Kimaiyo came out gun blazing while giving his verdict on the singer's actions back in September 10. This was the day, the singer 'unseated' president Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto.Bahati who was entertaining the president and thousands of Jubilee supporters during the official grand launch of Jubilee Party at Kasarani stadium, forced president Kenyatta to vacate his official seat and sat on it for approximately 10 seconds while serenading First Lady Margaret Kenyatta with his hit song Mama.The 10 seconds of fame attracted positive and negative reactions from Kenyans of all walks of life, turning most into 'temporary analysts'.Some condemned Bahati's actions terming them as 'a show of disrespect' to the most powerful man in the country, while some did not read much into it in fact congratulating H.E president Kenyatta for his 'easy going nature' as well as showering Bahati with love dubbing him 'Kenya's shortest serving president'.But guess who else was not amused by the Machozi singer? You guessed it right, Dr. Kimaiyo who recently graduated with a PhD in sociology from the University of Nairobi.Today morning when he graced the Radio Jambo studios, Kimaiyo gave his two cents about the issue."Having had the opportunity to head the presidential escort unit as an escort commander no one is allowed in such occasions to walk right to where the president is and hug him, leave alone unseating him and sitting on the presidential seat," said Kimaiyo."It is in fact culturally regarded as a curse. You can never sit on your superior's seat even in your home there's no way a child can sit on his or her father's seat," added the former police boss who revealed that he once was an athlete as well as a boxer.He went on to say that "Bahati and those who were overseeing the performances were on the wrong.""We should not joke with security matters. The presidency should be protected. These are the norms, we must respect such offices," Kimaiyo continued.The former IG will be looking to unseat Kipchumba Murkomen as Senator for Elgeyo Marakwet county in the next general elections.Listen to Kimaiyo's take on the whole saga on Bahati 'unseating' the president.
