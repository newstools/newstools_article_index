Mandera schools will be forced to close if more teachers are not hired soon, area Knut executive secretary Mohamed Kullow Sheikh has said. Last week, the county government announced plans to sack 600 teachers employed by the Education department in October.According to TSC records, the county faces a shortage of 520 secondary school and 670 primary school teachers. Hundreds of non-local teachers fled Mandera, Wajir and Garissa following al Shabaab attacks. The Teachers Service Commission threatened to replace the teachers who refused to report to work in Northeastern. But the government only employed 43 primary school and 33 secondary school teachers to fill the gap left by the 600 tutors. It s my appeal to the government to quickly move in and address the matter by employing and posting teachers to this area before it is too late. We would not wish to see our children suffer as happened in 2014, Kullow told the Star on the phone on Monday.Last week, Finance executive Ibrahim Barrow said the budget did not factor in payment for the teachers employed to stand in for their TSC counterparts.
