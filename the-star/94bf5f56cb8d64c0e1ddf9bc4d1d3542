The two told the Star they were sent by directors of the Njiru Githunguri farm to stop the construction of the house on allegations that the management of farm had obtained a court order. We were four of us when we went to the farm on the Gesora road. We asked the workers to stop construction because of a court order. They started chasing us and shouting that we are thieves. They managed to grab the two of us. Fifty people beat us thoroughly. Our colleagues escaped and called the other youths who came to our rescue, Ali said. They said police arrested four people.
