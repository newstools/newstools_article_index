The state will not penalise artistes shooting films on the national heritage sites, Sports and Culture CS Hassan Wario has said.He said to promote local film content, there will be a waiver on film shooting done on key national heritage sites.Wario said, however, those who want to make the films will have to seek permission from relevant authorities.He spoke in Kisumu during a meeting for the creative industry.The CS urged media houses to promote local music content. We want to increase the local content from 60 per cent hence the media fraternity should move with us towards this objective," he said.Wario urged artistes to be more innovative and do more research for their work to compete favourably with other international artists.He said the ministry plans to put up monuments in two historical sites in all the counties through a project Kenya through 100 monuments.
