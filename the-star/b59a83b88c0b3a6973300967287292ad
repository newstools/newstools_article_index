Kisii Governor James Ongwae has said ongoing political realignments will not distract his development agenda for the county.On Sunday, a group advocating for Kisii unity endorsed Senator Chris Obure to vie against him. Another group backed Ongwae s re-election bid at a separate function. An Omogusii is a proud and enlightened person who can make informed choices when it comes to politics. As a community, we should not get to a situation where we are rushed into certain decisions because it is not possible to lump independent-minded people into one pot, Ongwae said.Justifying the impossibleHe said those calling for Kisii unity are trying to justify the impossible. the governor said over the years, the Omogusii have never received relief food because of their extended family relations and togetherness. As a governor, I will not waver politically because you need to stand for what you believe in. Nobody should cheat our people that we will develop using goodies from the national government. What our leaders should be fighting for is more resources to be sent to the devolved units. The issue of going to beg for development shouldn t arise, he said.Ongwae spoke in Dallas, United States, where he helped raise Sh3 million to aid the search for missing Kenyan Samwel Mosioma. Ongwae is in the US for a one-week official tour.The governor is expected to visit the Minnesota Fire Department to meet fire safety experts. Last year, experts from the Minnesota Fire Department visited Kisii and trained county officers on modern firefighting skills. They also donated firefighting gear.Ongwae urged the Kisii diaspora community to invest back home and grow the economy. He said there are diverse investment opportunities in Kisii that would yield quick returns.
