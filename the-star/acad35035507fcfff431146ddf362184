The equine sport weekend action continues on Sunday as racing enters its second meet of the season at the Ngong racecourse. Seven races are on the card. They mostly focus on handicap races with a condition maiden race thrown in. It will definitely be an afternoon of speed as only one race will be run over 2060m. The other six are sprint races.This is the stage when riders and trainers alike pick up on their season campaign for jockey/trainer championships. Trainer Onesmus Mutua was top last season. James Muhindi was honoured as the top jockey in the championship that was previously claimed by Patrick Mungai. Upcoming jockeys are also optimistic and show readiness to keep the challenge going. The meeting at Ngong starts with an open race for amateurs and apprentices in a field of five. It will be run over 1200m. This will be followed by the only maiden race which has attracted six contenders. Then there is The Likaiu handicap which gives a chance to horses that have won only won once or shown potential over 2060m.Everything set, all eyes will be on the best athlete to grab The Nakuru Race Club Cup which is the only feature race. This handicap race, a sprint from the bend, pulls together six fancied characters to star in a race that is arguably very open.
