The Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology has started research to end cassava poisoning, a problem that has killed more than 20 Kenyans in the last five years.The Sh8 million project will also introduce high-yielding, pest and disease-free planting materials.It will largely benefit farmers in Western, Nyanza and Coast regions.The university estimates that farmers in these regions have planted cassava on more than 90,000 hectares, producing 540,000 tonnes every year.The project is based at the JKUAT's new virus diagnostics lab and greenhouse. It is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This laboratory forms a critical foundation in routine diagnostics of plant viruses whose accurate outcomes will greatly impact sustainable production of not only cassava, but also other crops in the country, head of National Commission for Science and Technology Dr Moses Rugut said.In the latest cassava poisoning incident, four siblings died last month after eating the roots in Uhuru village, Siaya county.Experts say tissue-cultured cassava is more poisonous if not properly processed.It naturally produces some chemicals, which during digestion are converted into cyanide, a toxic chemical that causes severe health problems.The "sweet" cassava variety contains small amounts of these chemicals but the "bitter" variety has high content and should be peeled thoroughly and cooked before consumption.The lethal effect of these toxins is proportional to the body weight and that is why children easily die.The project will also help farmers produce more cassava of high-yielding varieties, the university said.Principal researcher Prof Elijah Ateka said 50 farmer groups have been trained on improved farming in Kilifi, Migori and Busia counties.JKUAT vice chancellor Prof Mabel Imbuga lauded BMGF for the funding, which she said has equipped the university to undertake applied research that will provide the solutions to agro-based challenges in Kenya and the region."This will certainly contribute to the country s food security as well as raise the economic well-being of farmer households as envisaged in Vision 2030," Imbuga, who was represented by Romanus Odhiambo, said.
