Embu elders on Wednesday denied claims they endorsed Senator Lenny Kivuti for governor, saying their colleagues who did so were coerced.About 200 members of the Mbeere and Ngome Council of Elders endorsed Kivuitu last Saturday. Former Transport PS Cyrus Njiru, who is also in the governor s race, on Tuesday said the move will divide the county.Led by the council spokesman Ben Kanyenji and political secretary Justin Ngure, the elders said that the endorsement of Kivuti will divide the Mbeere and Embu communities.Kanyenji said the endorsement violates an MoU that Ngome elders and their Embu counterparts signed on January 29, 2011.The said MoU stated the governor should come from Embu and the senator from Mbeere. They were to serve for two terms concurrently.This means the status quo remains in this election. However, Ngure said the MoU was a case of negotiated democracy to ensure unity among ethnic groups. They said they still stand by their position to endorse Kivuti, who is from Mbeere.Speaking during a press conference at Montiego Hotel in Embu, the elders said the move has tainted the name of the council which now appears divided and a rubberstamp for politicians interests.Ngure warned Kivuti that he has no blessing or support from Embu elders in his bid for governor.He said their colleagues did not endorse Kivuti willingly and that they were coerced into it at his home in Kanyuambora, Mbeere North subcounty. Senator Kivuti did not pick the phone or respond to text messages for comment.Mbeere elders said they endorsed him because of his exemplary leadership as senator. Kivuti earlier said the elders had approached him and asked him to stand for governor, which he did.
