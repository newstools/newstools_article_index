The IEBC has thrown cold water on a plot by some senators to bar governors from running if they are unable to account for public funds.The electoral agency says it has no power to block them.Chairman Isaack Hassan and vice chairperson Lillian Mahiri-Zaja yesterday told the Senate Accounts Committee the law does not allow them to bar from election governors and other accounting officers facing audit queries if they have been cleared by their political parties.Committee chairman and Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong o was pushing for governors who have defied summonses to respond to audit queries to be barred from seeking reelection. They include Meru Governor Peter Munya and his Kakamega counterpart Wycliffe Oparanya.Hassan said the commission can only block a candidate who is convicted by the court and all appeal avenues exhausted.He said the powers to block any aspirant lies with the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. We cannot bar any candidate based on a parliamentary report on financial impropriety or from the Auditor General. For the IEBC to have such powers, we need to amend the Constitution, and the Integrity and Leadership Act, Hassan said. Once a candidate has been presented with a nomination certificate, we will clear them. Mahiri-Zaja said the IEBC does not vet the candidates, but the EACC does. It requires all aspirants to fill the self-declaration form.Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi said all accounting public officers, including governors entrusted with managing taxpayers money should be held accountable before being allowed to vie. The officers must account for every public shilling under their watch during their reign before contesting in the next polls, he said.
