War crimes judges on Tuesday sentenced a former extremist rebel who admitted wrecking holy shrines during Mali&#39;s 2012 conflict to nine years in prison, in the first such case to focus on destruction of cultural heritage.During a brief trial at the International Criminal Court in August Ahmad al-Mahdi asked for forgiveness and said he had been swept up in an &quot;evil wave&quot; by al Qaeda and the Ansar Dine groups that briefly seized control of the ancient sites.In June and July of 2012 &quot;10 of the most important and well-known sites in Timbuktu were attacked and destroyed. ... a war activity aimed at breaking the soul of the people,&quot; said presiding Judge Raul Pangalangan.Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of nine to 11 years for al-Mahdi, who sat quietly in a gray suit, nodding as the verdict was read aloud.Judges said the sentence took into account al-Mahdi&#39;s expression of remorse and cooperation with the court.Al-Mahdi admitted to involvement in the destruction of key historic mausoleums and religious sites in Timbuktu dating from Mali&#39;s 14th-century golden age as a trading hub and centre of Sufi Islam, a branch of the religion seen as idolatrous by some hardline Muslim groups.&nbsp;
