You are about to publish your first book titled Tears for My Motherland, why did you find this necessary?I find it absolutely important to let Kenyans and all readers understand what went wrong historically, and what needs to be done for Kenya to redeem herself among the nations of the world. We must strive to make the country good for every one of us, the rich and the poor. Currently, we rank amongst the 10 most unequal nations in the Globe, fifth in Africa. You will notice that my book identifies the problems and clearly mirrors the state of the nation, yet it avails well-thought-out solutions to them. I am excited to present this to Kenyans.What do you think Kenya needs at the moment in order for national unity to be realized and to fast-track development?This country needs a balanced leadership. We need to have two and a maximum of three political parties. Kenyans follow and take politics seriously. We currently have over 62 political parties which have absolutely succeeded in tearing Kenya apart on basis of tribe. Tribalism has flourished greatly and this is attributable to this agenda which was set some time back and which continues to be sustained to the detriment of national unity. Everyone, especially the poor, need to be empowered so that they can participate in development. There is enough for all of us but leadership must step up; leaders must undertake participatory development processes and public must shun those who don t as well as divisive ones.What has been your relationship with Uhuru Kenyatta?I have not had anything personal against Uhuru Kenyatta. However, there are normal differences when it comes to issues. While I am in the opposition, he is the president of Kenya and my job is to keep the government in check. I supported Uhuru in 2002, and I worked with him in the 10th parliament. He was minister of finance and Deputy Prime Minister and I was chief whip in that government. We had a cordial relationship and a strong friendship. Hopefully, he will read the book because it aims at making our society better and so it is good that everyone read.Do you hate members of the Kikuyu community?No, I do not hate them at all. Among my best friends and business associates are many members of the kikuyu community. I speak fluent Kikuyu; many workers in my company are drawn from all communities of Kenya including the Kikuyu and indeed have worked with many of these brothers and sisters in politics. In the Democratic Party, for instance, I was co-patron alongside the late Njenga Karume. Mwai Kibaki was a leader in the party which also had the late John Michuki. I put much of my energy and resources in party activities with fervent belief that our nationhood is more important than tribe, I have worked with leaders from all tribes in Kenya because I believe in this more than anything else.What issues do you tackle in your book?In this book, I call on all of us to reflect on the past while looking brightly into and building the future. The original resistance of the Mau Mau synchronized with the constitutional war of the Kapenguria six was meant to usher in independence and equality and was led by courageous Kenyans.Unfortunately, soon after a black master took over from the white master, disappointing the people. The likes of Tom Mboya, Pio Gama Pinto, J M Kariuki, Oginga Odinga, Seroney, Ngugi Thiong o, Koigi Wamwere, Raila Odinga, Wangari Maathai, Willy Mutunga, Kenneth Matiba, Charles Rubia, James Orengo, Martin Shikuku and George Nthenge and others struggled to overcome the black masters. Yet we still have a long way to go in order to defeat the enemies our founding fathers identified; disease ignorance and poverty.Many mistakes have been made and we have to endeavor to correct them. Therefore, I recommend courage, a virtue without which we can overcome the numerous challenges we are still facing. I also highlight and avail solutions for education and health in our nation. I also undertook to dissect corruption and availed solutions to this major source of stagnation in our country.There is a great need for unity of purpose against tribalism. Notwithstanding our differences socially, culturally and politically, we must respect God s design for us to live together. Indeed, there is no single dominant tribe in Kenya because we are a country of minorities. We should spread ethnic hatred as it has battered us severely in the past. When certain folks commit crimes, they should be allowed to hide behind tribe and run scot-free.We must stand together in order to achieve national self-actualization. Tribes were God s idea which we cannot change as it is not bad at all, but tribalism is awful and we must shun it. Geographical restrictions by the British are what started the problem, as my book will demonstrate. We must deal with the matter of distribution of resources which causes conflict.There is a dire need for clean, accessible water in many parts of Kenya and I have examined this. Going by statistics about 31% of Kenyans have access to piped water which is either at their households or communal. 37% get it from open springs, streams or rivers while the rest from wells, water vendors or other sources. There is obviously much to be done in this area. 38% of Kenyans, according to the WHO, lack access to safe drinking water, the number rises to 54% if you consider rural areas only. We must deal with this.Ignorance is very dangerous for a society and thus education becomes indispensable as we face tomorrow. I have paid for the education of at least 825 students over the years; through secondary school, college or university besides supporting projects in the sector. These are making a positive difference in our society. However, education needs to be made affordable so that our children can optimize opportunities that technology, agriculture and business present. Anyone who supports education should do so with all their heart, there is great need across the country and it is a working key to overcoming poverty, disease and ignorance. I studied at the Gemological Institute of America under the Graduate Gemologist and Diamond Grading Program and this made me very effective at my work in the field of mineral stones. This strengthens my belief that education is a gift that nobody can take away from you. We have to be enthusiastic about education.You recently ran into trouble when you mooted the idea of a rotational presidency, tell me about this .Every community in Kenya ought to have the opportunity and confidence to lead this country. We must all have a sense of belonging. The worst scenario I foresee is where certain communities might have the belief that they cannot ascend to power owing to their small numbers, small size of land they occupy or their limited wealth. This is something that has led to cessation in certain countries. My proposition had this in mind and it was not an attempt to hurt our national unity. We should welcome various views as long as they do not flout our constitution.You were already a successful businessman when you entered the fray of politics in Kenya, what drew you to it?I got into politics in the early 1990s, driven by a desire to serve my people and to make a positive difference in society. Over the years, I have achieved much that I am proud of and will continue to strive to achieve more together with other Kenyans.What motivates you each day as you arise?I have been used to hard work since childhood. Nothing comes easy, the challenges inspire me. There are vital values in this book which I want Kenyans to reflect on. This book will touch many lives in our country, as long as people approach it with an open, clear and unbiased mind, the same as I have written it.
