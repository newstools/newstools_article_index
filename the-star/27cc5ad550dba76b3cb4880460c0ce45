Homeland Lounge, an entertainment joint along Thika SuperHighway, has sued the Kenya Revenue Authority in a dispute where the taxman is demanding Sh33 million in arrears. In court documents filed at the High Court in Milimani, Homeland says the taxman has tasked Keysian Auctioneers to sell off its goods to recover the amount, yet it does not owe KRA any money. It says it is not aware of the basis upon which demand for tax arrears against it is being made. Through lawyer David Ndegwa, Homeland Lounge explains that the tax arrears that KRA is demanding and has issued a distress to, belongs to a different legal entity with a distinct taxpayer personal number.The restaurant says a distress has been issued to David Wokabi Muriithi of Homeland Inn, yet the goods Keysian is seeking to sell in a bid to recover the money are in the premises of Homeland Lounge.
