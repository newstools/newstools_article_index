Elderly people aged 70 and above in Nyandarua will get free medical services if and when a resolution by the county assembly is implemented.The assembly has directed its Budget and Appropriations Committee to come up with a medical fund for the elderly.Health Committee chairman Peter Kairu, who moved the motion, said it is important for the government to help the vulnerable. Allowing creation of this fund is one of the greatest honour you can accord the senior citizens, he said. Kairu said advanced age limits their ability to work and earn a living to cater for their daily needs, including access to medical services. The senior citizens have been hindered from accessing the services by the fees charged. This contributes to reduction of their life expectancy, he said.After the motion was passed yesterday, speaker Wahome Ndegwa said the executive will come up with legislation to implement the motion. If the motion is implemented, the Finance executive will appoint an officer to administer the fund. Nyandarua has about 40,000 people aged above 70.
