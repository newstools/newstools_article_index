Elgeyo Marakwet leaders have been urged to stop politicising the construction of a Sh30 billion multipurpose dam in Arror, Marakwet West.Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said some leaders are inciting residents against the project for selfish political gains. I urge our leaders to facilitate proper access to information on this project. We should not be driven by selfish interests, he said.The project will supply irrigation water to the dry areas of Kerio Valley and generate 70MW of power. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Murkomen denied reports that Sh20 billion, part of the money earmarked for the project, has been stolen. It is irresponsible for some people to claim money has been stolen. This is part of the propaganda peddled by some leaders to halt the project, he said.
