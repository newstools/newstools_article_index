Three politicians have urged Busia residents to reelect Governor Sospeter Ojaamong.They are Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula and former legislators Joseph Lagat and Raphael Wanjala. They accompanied Water CS Eugene Wamalwa during his two-day tour of Busia at the weekend. They said Ojaamong s development record is good. Your governor is my in-law and I will be a very happy man if you vote him back. My Luhya brothers are parading every Tom, Dick and Harry for the seat. Ojaamong will win as early as 8am, Otsiula said.He said Ojaamong deserves a second term. The national government had neglected Busia, but Ojaamong s administration has tried to narrow that gap, Otsiula said.Lagat said he knew Ojaamong when he was the vice chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and Ojaamong was a member. I am happy with what he is doing as the county boss. Give him an opportunity to serve you again. He is a good friend of mine, he said.Wanjala said there will be a fierce battle between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Cord leader Raila Odinga for the presidency.He said he supports Ojaamong for reelection.
