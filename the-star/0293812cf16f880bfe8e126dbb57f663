ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said he is the only opposition candidate who can remove the malfunctioning Jubilee administration from power.He urged the Luhya community to join him and other Kenyans to remove the abusive regime. Anyone supporting Jubilee in this region is lost. The regime has the audacity to tell us we can only smell the meat, even if we cook it, Mudavadi said.He urged Cord co-principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang ula to support him. You want Jubilee send packing by 8am on August 8, 2017? We have one weapon against this frightful regime Musalia Mudavadi. We have no time to argue. I am willing, ready and rearing to go, Mudavadi said.He said the anti-party hopping bill Jubilee thought would help it can only work against them. Mudavadi said many politicians who hopped, skipped and jumped to Jubilee are now turning back in droves. They were lied to that a new party was being formed. They even believed they will be made its official owners. What is the truth now? The Jubilee Alliance Party officials were recycled and now they lead JP. They now know if Kanu had owners, Jubilee is a landlord who locks you out for higher rent, he said.Mudavadi was addressing mourners during the burial of Vihiga Senator George Khaniri s niece in Hamisi constituency on Saturday.He urged Vihiga residents to let him hunt for votes away from home because Luhyas alone cannot make him president. I have to add to our numbers. I will be away most of the time, but remember where we are going, Mudavadi said. He said he has no preferred ANC candidates for elective positions.Mudavadi urged party members not to use his name to stop others from joining the party. He said ANC members will choose candidates democratically.
