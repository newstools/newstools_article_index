Reason? A key Jubilee politician and a close confidant of the DP has reportedly ignored the brokers, who largely include politicians and business magnates, and is now working with the Jubilee re-election team. The two groups clashed outside the DP s office on Tuesday over the sharing out of Sh10 million released to fund the ongoing campaigns for Jubilee candidates in various wards ahead of by-elections. While one group claimed to be the legitimate entity to handle campaign funds, another grabbed a bag containing the cash. Security officers intervened to avert a hugely embarrassing scene. **********After moving from Westlands constituency to Embakasi East, University of Nairobi student leader Babu Owino s political fortunes seem to have dwindled.

It is said after sending their ID numbers to 22464, Babu was shocked to realise three quarters of them are not registered voters in the constituency. However, the few who registered are said to have shifted their allegiance and are now supporting a different aspirant. ***********Some parliamentary aspirants from a constituency in Nyeri and another in Nairobi are an unhappy lot.

Disgruntled aspirants believe the relationship will be a threat to them as they can use each other s connections to advance politically. The wannabes are looking daggers at the relationship.
