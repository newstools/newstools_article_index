Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria (pictured) has urged National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi to convene a special session to discusselectoral reforms.Responding to a statement by Muturi on the delay in replacing the IEBC commissioners, he said there is a vacuum in the process, which Parliament must fill. During the deliberations at the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee on the IeBC, I introduced the motion, which was supported by all the other 13 members that our committee gets a fresh mandate to oversee the implementation of our report, akin to the role CIOC had to oversee the implementation of the constitution under Hon Mohammed Abdikadir, Kuria said.He said this was included in the final report on the IEBC reforms that was passed by the National Assembly and the Senate.Kuria said Muturi s comments that the Treasury and the Attorney General s office are delaying the process are just the tip of the iceberg. The worst nightmare will happen next Friday (September 30) when a commission should be in place, failing to which the current commissioners will be under obligation to oversee the August 8, 2017 general election. By October 15, we are supposed to kick off the special audit of the register and form a broadbased team to guide the procurement of critical ICT components to avoid the technology challenges of 2013, Kuria said.He said the mass voter registration set for February appears seriously in doubt if not unfeasible and the capability of the IEBC to conduct party nominations and the new laws passed by Parliament appear to be at serious risk. With this backdrop, the reform process we negotiated has neither an owner, a manager nor a midwife. It was evident that certain forces within House committees were not comfortable with extension of the JPSC to oversee implementation of our report, Kuria said.
