The dilapidated and impassable road which made it difficult for employees working at the airport to access the JKIA has finally been graded.The road which is next to the posh Simba Villa flats serves thousands of residents and has been in a sorry state for the last four years.Its also the main access road to the Kenya Airways Headquarters Pride Centre.Embakasi East MP John Ogutu told the Star that despite the road being a mere stretch of 500 meters, it was a major link road to the North airport road.He said that residents should appreciate that road works take long and that planning has to be done."I thank the residents for being patient. Some took to social media and accused us of doing little. However, I want to assure them that we will continue to do more since there are funds in place. Residents should not despair as they have in the past," he said.Omondi added that in the next three months, all the feeder roads which are always impassable will be graded before the long rains next year."We will not listen nor be taken aback with our opponents who purport to know much. Some of them are ignorant of the facts and they are barking dogs which you must not stop to listen to listen to them. " he said.
