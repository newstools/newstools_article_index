Mwamdudu residents have accused the Kwale county government of not resolving historical land injustices.The dispute involving 2,000 acres in Kinango is said to have been presented to leaders last year but no action has been taken.Residents secretary Stephen Mbinu and chairman Hamisi Mwero met opposition chief Raila Odinga during an ODM rally in Kinango on Thursday. It has become so hard for us to reclaim the land and ensure we get title deeds. We have a primary school which was constructed in 1965 but the developers now want it demolished, Mbinu said. He said MCA Anthony Yama, MP Gonzi Rai and Governor Salim Mvurya are all aware of the problem have ignored them. When we started calling for our ancestral land the government associated us with terrorists. Developers have colluded with police to harass and arrest us, Mbinu said.
