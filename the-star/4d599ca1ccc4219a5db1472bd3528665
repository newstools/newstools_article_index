Kenya has been spared a credit downgrade by Standard and Poor's, a year after the rating agency warned the country would lose its investment grade.S&amp;P Global on Friday revised the debt outlook on Kenya to stable from negative and affirmed a B+ long-term and B short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings.The agency said the stable outlook reflects the expectation that strong economic growth prospects over the next year and improved government financing conditions will facilitate debt reduction and contain increases in external indebtedness. Kenya's economic growth performance and prospects remain strong - in our view, and both fiscal and external performance has improved recently. We also note that the elevated risks seen toward the end of 2015, including the government's then very tight liquidity position, have eased, S&amp;P analysts said.S&amp;P's ratings on Kenya have largely remained constrained due to the country's history of ethnic tensions, low GDP per capita, high government debt, and susceptibility to balance-of-payments pressures.In October 2015,S&amp;P downgraded Kenya s credit outlook to negative and warned of a possible junk rating if the country would continue experiencing a cash crunch and runaway debt.The agency maintained the rating in the negative territory in a revision done in June this year, due to increased political tensions and a budget deficit of about $6.9 billion (Sh699.03billion) in the 2016/2017 fiscal year.In August, the agency warned that Kenya s credit worthiness is facing a possible downgrade in the next one year due to a rising budget deficit and political temperatures ahead of next year s general elections.According to S&amp;P, the recent measures aimed at reforming the electoral commission are likely to temper frustrations in the run-up to August 2017 general elections. We could raise the ratings if we see prospects for sustained political and economic stability, including declining budgetary imbalances, supported particularly by expenditure control, alongside a sustained improvement in Kenya's external accounts, it said.Recent forecast by the World Bank indicates Kenya's economy will grow at an average six per cent per year over 2016 to 2019.Growth will largely be supported by the ongoing standard gauge railway project, which is likely to attract private-sector investment along its corridor.S&amp;P said the government has enough capacity to support external financing needs over the next 18 months due to the $1.5 billion (Sh151.96billion) stand-by agreement signed in March with the IMF. Since our last review, weather patterns have changed, and steady rains appear to have boosted agricultural production and also electricity generation. Potential oil production could also lift growth, although we view this as a long-term prospect, beyond our forecast horizon.
