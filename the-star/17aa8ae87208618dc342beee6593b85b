Will it be Kenya Ports Authority women or Uganda Christian University students?That s the big question Kenya basketball fans are asking as the FIBA Africa Zone Five club championships draws to a close this evening in Dar es Salaam.New champions will be crowned in both the men s and women s categories after defending champions Egypt men and Berco Stars women failed to show up for this year s event.KPA women who started the championships on a positive note went into a deep slumber losing to UCU in an otherwise easy encounter to throw the title chase wide open.They must therefore beat KCCA of Uganda today and pray that United States international University beat UCU this afternoon for them to reclaim the trophy they last won four years ago. We want to remain positive and realise our dreams of reclaiming the title though some bit of luck will also be needed in this one, KPA head coach Anthony Ojukwu said after yesterday s match against Jeshi la Kujenga Taifa of Tanzania whom KPA clobbered 73-41.In this encounter against JKT Stars that saw KPA field a second string side, Annrose Mandela top scored with 12 points while Felmas Adhiambo had 10 points.JKT replied through Diana Sekera.In Wednesday matches, United States international University (USIU) lost to Rwanda s APR 71-57 but still made it to the semi final.In the men s semi finals that were programmed for last evening USIU were to play City Oilers from Uganda while Ulinzi Warriors took on Patriot from Rwanda.Elsewhere Western Delight will be in Nairobi for two crucial women s premier league matches at the Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium this weekend. The Kakamega based youngsters have given their best but they must register wins in Nairobi to make the play offs. They are at the base of the table with 10 points from only three wins.Coach Donald Liruh is aware of the task ahead as they myst win the two fixtures against Co-operative Bank of Kenya tomorrow and Strathmore University a day latter or they face the big drop.
