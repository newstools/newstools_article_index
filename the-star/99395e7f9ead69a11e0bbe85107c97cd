A Nairobi assembly sitting to debate impeachment of Governor Evans Kidero was adjourned yesterday due to lack of quorum. All Cord and 20 Jubilee MCAs boycotted the meeting.The missing MCAs reportedly were meeting at Boulevard Hotel, as reports swirled about that they had been bribed to skip the sitting.MCAs had brawled in chambers over whether to table the impeachment motion, which finally was approved for debate. Many MCAs had signed the petition, then got cold feet.Speaker Alex Magelo and the House Business Committee had given the motion a go-ahead despite the governor obtaining a court order to stop it.Minority whip Ngaruiya Chege (Kahawa West MCA) said, This is a constitutional process that the court cannot interfere with. He has realised that and now he is buying everybody to boycott this session so that it can lack quorum. In court papers, Kidero denied allegations raised in the motion as grounds for his impeachment. He told the court that the motion is malicious, defamatory, vindictive, immoral, irresponsible and political, with the intention to intimidate him.He was accused of lack of leadership, incompetence, failure to implement the Ward Development Fund, responsibility for soaring Sh42 billion debt, and failure to disclose all debts, among other issues.High Court judge Roselyne Aburili certified Kidero s application urgent. The orders yesterday were served on speaker Alex ole Magelo and clerk Jacob Ngwele.Magelo ordered the motion be in today s order paper for debate.If the motion is not debated in the House for three consecutive days, it is disposed off. It can only be brought back after six months.But Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang wara, the motion s sponsor, said he will now deal with the executives whose departments have been cited in audit reports for mismanagement of public funds.Last week, the governor was summoned by the speaker to appear before the county assembly yesterday to defend himself against allegations in the impeachment motion.The motion was tabled in the House on Tuesday last week. On two days, there were fistfights over the motion.
