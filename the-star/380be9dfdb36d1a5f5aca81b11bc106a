Governments have been tasked to come up with stringent policies to stop illegal online wildlife trade. Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora unanimously agreed to curb cybercrime.Parties to CITES must ensure that law enforcers, governments and online technology companies work closely to save wildlife. Kenya tabled the proposal at the just-ended CITES meeting in South Africa. Governments are required to establish and share best practices on enforcement, including working with Interpol to establish guidelines for investigations. We are delighted and thank particularly Kenya, which tabled the issue at the conference in Johannesburg. Wildlife cybercrime is a serious threat to endangered species as research conducted by us since 2004 has established, Tania McCrea-Steele said. She is the International Fund for Animal Welfare global wildlife cybercrime project lead. The meeting took place between September 24 and October 5.
