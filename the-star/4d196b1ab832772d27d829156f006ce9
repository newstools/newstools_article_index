Vihiga governor Moses Akaranga has said he will honour Senate summons to answer questions on over graft allegations in his county.Akaranga is set to appear before the Finance, Commerce and Budget committee to respond to a petition filed by 12 Vihiga MCAs.Last Tuesday, the committee wrote to DPP asking him to order the arrest of Akaranga for ignoring the summons.Read: Senate team writes to DPP, wants Vihiga governor held Lawyers are currently engaging the DPP to explain that the governor did not snub summons and he wants to be given more time to prepare answers for the questions they are asking, he said through his head of communication Peter Athiaya.Vihiga senator George Khaniri had on Friday asked Akaranga to honour the summons as the consequences could be dire.Khaniri countersigned the petition by the 12 MCAs on February 15, 2016.The petitioners are Andrew Ahuga, Gladys Analo, Peter Amuhinda, Joshua Olao, Nathan Kamidi, David Ogova, Wycliffe Mosini, Josephat Munayi, Venna Kaisha, Richard Muhiga, Pamela Amunga and Bernard Kiwanuka.They want the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, DPP and CID to conduct a joint forensic audit of the county finances.They also want EACC to carry out a lifestyle audit on all members of the county executive committee.Akaranga allies on Sunday claimed that the authors of the petition only wanted to re-introduce the ad hoc committee report through the senate after it was defeated in the assembly. This is just politics, we agree that there are elements of corruption in Vihiga County but the timing to revive this matter a few months to the election is suspect. We know of senior county leaders who were behind the formation of the ad hoc committee to fix the governor, said a MCA who did not want to be named.Also read: Akaranga tells senators to go and engage governors in counties to cut costs
