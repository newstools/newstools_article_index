Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama has accused ODM leader Raila Odinga of dictatorship.He said the party lacks democracy and is threatening to kick out rebels. We read in the media about letters we have received from the party s disciplinary committee. We have not received any letter and we treat that as mere propaganda, he said yesterday during an interview with the Star.Arama said rebels still pay Sh20,000 monthly contributions to the party. If they were true to their word, why are they still receiving our money? If they are genuine, they should have stopped, he said.Arama denied claims the rebels were paid cash to join the Jubilee Party. Why should some people claim I received Sh5 million to join JP? That s my two months salary, he said.
