The ICPC has petitioned the Ombudsman demanding the marking scheme for the position of Chief Justice.The Judicial Service Commission nominated judge David Maraga, 65, as the Chief Justice to replace Willy Mutunga, who retired in June 2016. He was among 11 judges shortlisted by the JSC for the position.Ndung'u Wainaina, executive director of the International Center for Policy and Conflict, made the demand on Monday saying the commission is answerable to Kenyans.In a letter obtained by the Star, Wainaina said the JSC was operating in deep secrecy, which is against the constitution.He noted the 2010 constitution allowed Kenyans access information held by public institutions.The work of the JSC and that of its employees are therefore subject to public review and scrutiny, he said."I am Kenyan Citizen ID number 11613181, Under the constitution and Information Act, I am entitled to access to information held by state and or its agencies," he said."Therefore I am seeking your immediate action on this matter and compel the JSC to uphold the constitutional rights of a citizen."Wainaina said the commission failed to comply with the request after he petitioned it in September.He noted the information was urgent and vital to the country, based on the history of the judiciary and its centrality to the stability of the country. Wainaina also said the JSC was a constitutional body established by Kenyans to serve public interest in safeguarding the independence of the judiciary and ensuring its functional and operational autonomy."Judicial authority is derived from the people of Kenya. Consequently, the JSC cannot operate outside this constitutional scheme," the executive director said.Maraga's name was forwarded to President Uhuru Kenyatta and then to the National Assembly which will vet him.[VIDEO] Uhuru forwards name of CJ nominee Maraga to ParliamentRead: Why JSC settled on Justice David Maraga
