KenGen has begun a geothermal development study with a view to producing more power. MD Albert Mugo said Kenya has the potential to produce 10000MW geothermal energy in 23 sites. So far we have only tapped 650MW of geothermal energy and we are working with other partners so we can increase geothermal power, he said.Mugo said the cost of geothermal exploration had for years remained the biggest impediment. Despite the challenge, we have seen the number of geothermal wells rise from two in the 1970s to 218 currently, he said.Mugo defended KenGen operations in Hell s Gate National Park in Naivasha and said the firm is working with the Kenya Wildlife Service to conserve and protect the ecosystem.A few months ago, environmentalists said birds in the park were declining at an alarming rate due to the ongoing works. They said the park is supposed to protect the dwindling numbers of wildlife.
