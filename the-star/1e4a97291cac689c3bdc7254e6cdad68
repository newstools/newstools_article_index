The Embu governor s office needs to be run by a skilled manager, not a politician, a former PS has said.Cyrus Njiru, an Embu governor aspirant, has dismissed other candidates, including the incumbent Martin Wambora. Others are management consultant Kithinji Kiragu and Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire. He said politicians are unable to run the county as governors.The former PS said the office is sensitive and demanding, thus requires somebody with the knowledge and experience to manage big institutions. Njiru said he has been tested and has the experience required to manage the county.He said he represented 53 countries in infrastructure development in Africa at the African Development Bank before he was recalled by President Mwai Kibaki to serve as PS. If I served 53 countries and also as a PS, running the county to the greatest height of development will be very easy for me, Njiru said.He spoke on Sunday at St Stephen s ACK Kangaru. Njiru said if a politician is elected to run the county, he will spend all the time politicking and engaging in confrontations rather than uniting residents and developing the area.He said Embu needs a manager who is focused, honest, accountable and able to unite all leaders and the people.Politicians only solve problems politically, Njiru said.The former PS said a leader should be a selfless servant who is devoted to helping residents and fulfilling promises.Njiru said in all the institutions he has served, he has never been involved in any scandal, therefore, he is fit to be governor.
