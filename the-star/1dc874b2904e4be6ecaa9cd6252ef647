THE rhetorical clash between President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga at former Cabinet minister William Ntimama s funeral was uncalled-for.Unfortunately, the two most powerful and influential politicians in the land were keeping up the awful tradition of playing politics at funerals, the most solemn ceremonies.The former Prime Minister got the ball of this lack of etiquette and protocol rolling with snide remarks about corruption on the Jubilee regime s watch and an alleged final phone conversation in which an ailing Ntimama reportedly changed his mind about defecting from ODM to JP.The President took the bait and riposted with his cutting remark about swallowing saliva (in opposition) and eating meat (in government). It was an unedifying spectacle and it wasted valuable time that would have been much better used reflecting on the deceased.This episode was political theatre fit only for diehard elements on both sides. A public spat between another President Kenyatta and another opposition leader Odinga in October 1969 ended in blood and tears.
