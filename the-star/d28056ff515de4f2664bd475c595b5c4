Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario has been given seven days to respond to a suit that seeks to reverse his decision to disband the National Olympics Committee of Kenya.Through his lawyer, Wario told High Court judge George Odunga that he required more time to respond to the suit filed by Nock chairman Kipchoge Keino, secretary general Francis Kinyiri and Treasurer Fridah Shiroya. The judge directed his lawyer to file and serve his replies within a week and go back to court on October 24 for further directions.The CS disbanded NOCK August 25 following the shambolic preparations and management of team Kenya during the Rio Olympics in Brazil. In disbanding Nock, Wario had said his decision was made in the public interest. In the suit, the former officials, however, says the CS decision was unlawful and in breach of fair administrative action.The three claims that the CS does not have powers under the Sports Act to unilaterally disband Nock or any other federation.The three further argues that the move by the CS is in bad faith, unreasonable and which if not stopped by the court, will lead to a ban of the Kenya s Olympic movement by the international Olympic committee (IOC). They are seeking several orders among them one to quash the decision disbanding Nock and closing its offices. The CS has embarked on an unreasonable campaign of harassment through unnecessary use of police and security mechanism with the intention of unlawfully crippling the affairs and administration of Nock, they said. They fault the CS for failing to give official information prior to his decision. According to them the Cs directive was based on unsubstantiated allegations.
