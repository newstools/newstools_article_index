A cassava meal turned tragic after it nearly cost the lives of 15 family members, including nine children in the drought stricken Magarini area of Kilifi county on Tuesday .They had only prepared the meal after going for three days without food.Trouble started after those who had eaten begun vomiting and diarrhoeaing. They said it was bitter but they thought it was only because it had overstayed. They had no option but to eat but little did they know the cassava had turned poisonous. Caroline Nzaro, one of the mothers of the children affected, said she bought the cassava from the local market.They were taken to the Marafa Health Centre after they failed to get medical services at the Bore Singwaya Dispensary. All the 15 were admitted in critical condition but are now said to be responding well to treatment. More than 300,000 people and thousands of animals in Kilifi are starving due to a prolonged drought.In Magarini alone, over 100,000 people both directly and indirectly have been affected and rely on relief food which is not enough. Those directly affected are 56,000. Dhahabu Wanje, the grandmother of the children, said she went home and found her grandchildren eating raw cassava.Because she was hungry, she joined them and ate both raw and roasted cassava, only to begin experiencing fever and stomachache. Area MCA Renson Kambi led other county officials to visit the patients in the hospital.
