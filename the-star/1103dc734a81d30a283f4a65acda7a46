A bullet was recovered from one of the female terror suspects killed in Mombasa's Central police station attack, an autopsy has indicated.Led by government pathologist Johansen Oduor, the exercise which was minimal, revealed injuries in the bodies."We recovered one bullet and handed it over for investigations. One totally burnt and the other had at least four bullet-wounds. There were head, arm and chest injuries," Oduor said at Coast General Hospital.The bodies of the twin slain suspects Maimuna and Ramla Abdulrahman Hussein were released from the hospital on Saturday evening and laid to rest at Manyimbo cemetery.Prayers were first conducted at Masjid- Ul- Khaiyarat - Kiziwi before the burial.A source close to the family said they were relieved they finally buried the bodies."This was psychological torture. But at last the bodies have been laid to rest," the source told the Star.Postmortem is yet to be conducted on the third suspect, identified as Tasnin Yakhub, since no one has come to claim the body.
