The Homa Bay government may not be able to effectively implement its budget this year due to lack of revenue, the assembly has said.A report tabled by the Assembly Committee on Finance and Economic Planning on Thursday indicates the county performs poorly in revenue collection. The MCAs say the revenue collection is at 0.3 per cent.This is 1.7 per cent less than the 2 per cent threshold required by the Commission on Revenue Allocation. The county will only receive Sh20.08 million of the 2 per cent allocation of Sh133.93 million, unless the estimated revenue of Sh233.54 million in the current financial year is attained or surpassed, committee chairman Godfrey Anyango said.
