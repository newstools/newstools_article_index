Police in Kisumu have been accused of protecting a gang said to strip innocent citizens and torture them to death. Kisumu Residents Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada (pictured) questioned why members of the China Squad gang have not been arrested for murder. Last month, the gang killed one person and left another with serious injuries.
