Former Water minister Mutua Katuku on Tuesday launched the People Trust Party gazetted two weeks ago.Katuku said the party intends to offer generational change in leadership and politics.The former Mwala MP said the birth of PTP was informed by the need to expand the democratic space and give Kenyans a chance to exercise their democratic rights."Dictatorship and impunity has been preferred by a large proportion of the country's leadership over the democracy thereby rendering political organisations the preserve of personality cults and a small clique of sycophants," Katuku said."Honest and genuine leaders have been edged out and replaced by the corrupt and the rich who have no interest in providing better lives for all Kenyans."He said a majority of citizens has been isolated and ignored at national and local levels of public participation and political elites. Katuku said politicians have failed to institute devolution.He said since the re-introduction of the political pluralism in early 1990s, politics have been dominated by ethically based by political groupings, non-representation and personalised political parties.Read: Kalonzo not keen on presidency, warming up to Jubilee - ex-minister KatukuKatuku said there was no consultation among the members before 11 parties were dissolved to form the Jubilee Party in September.He said many political parties are dominated by elites who have marginalised and manipulated Kenyans for short term gains. "Kenyans are tired of political parties that are nothing more than special purpose vehicles to elect selfish leaders or enclaves designed to protect tribal interests at the expense of the national good," Katuku said. "The birth of this party has been informed by the need to expand democratic space and give Kenyans a chance to exercise their democratic rights."Katuku said the party will field candidates in all elective seats and will be ready for a post-election pact with any other that will have formed the government "if not ourselves".The party has opened 29 offices in different counties and has its head office in Mlolongo, Machakos County.He spoke at Nairobi Safari Club hotel where he announced the registration of the party by the registrar of the political parties Lucy Ndung'u.
