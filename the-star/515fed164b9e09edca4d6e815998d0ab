Government silence on the El Adde attack on January 15 in which al Shabaab militants slaughtered scores of KDF soldiers and took away some as prisoners of war is deafening.Eight months since the raid, the only information on El Adde has come from media analysts and the terror group.Al Shabaab has released a video (see story page 16) of a man they purport is a KDF soldier captured in Al Adde. The man identifies himself by name and says he is a member of KDF s 9th Battalion s Moi Barracks in Eldoret. The truth or lack of it of the matter is now known to the 9th Battalion. Inquiries from inquisitive investigative reporters from around the world will follow.The DoD and Interior ministry haven t said anything all along. The public is hungry for information about how many soldiers died; how many bodies were recovered and how many are missing.It is a scandal that Kenyans are getting only the enemy s version of events.
