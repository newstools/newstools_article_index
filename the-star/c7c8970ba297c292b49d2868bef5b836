What a difference a week can make in football. Just six days ago, triple champions Gor Mahia s bid for a record setting fourth consecutive Sportpesa Premier League title had been written off by many.But yesterday s 1-0 victory against title rivals Ulinzi Stars that came hot on the heels of last weekend s win over Chemelil Sugar has not only put them back on track in their pursuit of history but has sent chills down the spines of the teams angling to replace them as champions. Having trailed league leaders Tusker by seven points a week ago today, Gor now with 43 points from 24 matches, are now just two behind the table toppers with Ulinzi eight adrift of the brewers.One-time crowd favourite who was also one target on Saturday, George Blackberry Odhiambo gave Gor a deserved lead five minutes before the break.That goal came just moments after league joint leading scorer John Makwata failed to take full advantage of an opportunity that came his way through a pass fromBrian Birgen. It was Gor who had started the game on the front foot with Odhiambo finding himself in the referee s book for an overzealous challenge on Cylus Shitote after just five minutes.Odhiambo nearly redeemed himself minutes later, getting on the end of a cross from Amos Nondi but his header was too close to James Saruni. Mid-way through the half, Jacques Tuyisenge rifled a shot towards goal after good work from compatriot Media Kagere but once again Saruni proved to be equal to the task. Enos Ochieng then came off worse in a fifty-fifty challenge with Abouba Sibomana, forcing a brief stoppage as he was being attended to. Against the run of play, Ulinzi fashioned an opening with Birgen picking out Makwata who fluffed his lines. Three minutes later Gor were ahead. Karim Nizigiyima s crossed the ball into the danger zone where Odhiambo took full advantage to convert past Saruni.
