DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro yesterday demanded former National Youth Service deputy director Adan Harakhe be charged for fraud in Sh791 million loss.Muhoro dismissed Harakhe s claims his IFMIS password was stolen and used to execute the NYS fraudulent payments. He said the system is not prone to hacking unless the password is shared.Muhoro questioned Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko s recommendation that Harakhe be converted to a witness in the NYS case. The DCI investigations found him culpable in fraud and was among the suspects. I don t know what made the DPP to make Harakhe a witness. My stand for Harakhe to be charged remains, he said.Muhoro was accompanied by other senior investigators from the department. He told the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee that IFMS is secure and solid and that Harakhe s account was open to anyone after the password was interfered with.Muhoro said their probe revealed Halakhe approved some fraudulent payments. From the browser system, we found it was him who approved the payments. We also realised NYS does not have an inventory system for machines allocated to individual users, Muhoro said. He said they are still investigating some serious financial impropriety.A special report by Auditor General Edward Ouko released in June revealed Sh1.9 billion was looted. The MPs questioned why Halakhe was interdicted from NYS but still earns full salary. We re shocked after you [Muhoro] investigated him and recommended his prosecution, his employer interdicted him five times, but he earns full salary and became a witness, Kieni MP Kanini Kega said.
