Singer Bahati must have turned into a daredevil or something, or he has developed a lot of confidence in himself!It also seems like his crying days are also far gone, forming part of his bad past.Everybody was in dismay when the Machozi hit maker literally forced President Uhuru to vacate from his official seat and sat on it on Saturday at the Kasarani Stadium.Read: Bahati Pens Down A Heartfelt Message To President Uhuru KenyattaThis was during the official grand launch of Jubilee Party, the political outfit by which President Uhuru and his Deputy William Ruto will be seeking re-election to office in next year's general election.When his turn to entertain the President and thousands of Jubilee loyalists, Bahati seemed to have taken a mile after only being given an inch! He took his 10 seconds of fame to serenade First Lady Margaret Kenyatta with his song Mama. So, was the whole thing a staged act or Bahati took it too far?We tried reaching the singer for his side of the narrative, but all his cellphone numbers had been switched off.However, he had this to say on his social media pages:"History Written. I "Bahati" becomes the shortest serving President as President Uhuru "vacates" his chair that I may sing the song Mama to Kenya's First Lady Margret Kenyatta!
