ODM has lashed out at President Uhuru Kenyatta for feigning helplessness in the fight against corruption.This comes after the head of state earlier scolded government officials over rampant corruption, saying the situation is frustrating. Uhuru, while at the Tuesday's State House summit on accountability, said he has provided resources yet officials keep complaining about lacking the same, and that he is not the one harbouring the vice.More on this: Frustrated Uhuru scolds state officials on rampant corruption"It was in extreme bad taste and most uncivil for the President to single out the Auditor General, Edward Ouko, for tongue-lashing in public," political affairs secretary Opiyo Wandayi said, "It smacks of dictatorship,""As ODM, in the circumstances, we are calling on the President to resign before we consider impeaching him," Wandayi said.Noting that the buck squarely stops with the President, the Ugunja MP said Uhuru is simply feigning helplessness in order to "hoodwink the public"."Everyone one knows that with or without the so-called independent institutions or agencies, the war against corruption can never be won without a demonstrated political will at the highest level," he said.Wandayi added that the President has all the intelligence briefing about all mega corruption cases, therefore, doesn't need the EACC or police."He just needs to crack the whip where it matters most," he said. Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi also hit back at the president and accused Uhuru of being "helpless by lamenting and passing the buck off being let down by anti-corruption agencies.""His demeanour was that of throwing in the towel... which amounts to the executive surrendering to corruption cartels," Mudavadi said.More on this: Uhuru's corruption 'frustration' is surrender to cartels - MudavadiAlso Read: Uhuru declares corruption 'a national security threat,' calls it a sin against God
