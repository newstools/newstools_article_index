Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi will camp in Nandi county this weekend to popularise his presidential bid.Mudavadi will also tour Bungoma county to sell his party which he describes as the best choice for Kenyans who have been caught up in the uncertainty of the Jubilee merger and uncertainty in Cord over nominations .Yesterday, Mudavadi said both Jubilee and Cord are closed shops for aspirants, and ANC offers a soft landing for those who want fair nominations and those who believe in multiparty democracy. ANC is open and all those who desire ANC tickets have until the end of October to register with the party, he said. During his visit to Bungoma on Sunday, Mudavadi is expected to receive more than 24 MCAs who have ditched New Ford Kenya and URP. The ward representatives opted to join ANC after their parties were dissolved to form Jubilee Party. The former Vice President will thereafter open ANC county office in Bungoma. Mudavadi s visit to Nandi comes at a time when there is disquiet among residents regarding the viability of Jubilee as a party. We must build parties that unite Kenyans willingly and not political machines where some people will be forced to toe the line, Mudavadi said.In 2013, the UDF party, then led by Mudavadi won seven ward representative seats out of 30 in Nandi county assembly.Mudavadi will meet opinion leaders in Nandi before proceeding to the funeral of Rev Kevolwe Osotsi, the father of Kiptuyia ward MCA Geoffrey Kevolwe, in Chesumet constituency.
