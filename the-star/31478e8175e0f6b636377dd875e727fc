IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba has asked the government to give direction on the future of the commission ahead of the 2017 election.Chiloba told young voters in Nairobi on Tuesday that the earlier the decision is reached, the easier it will be to prepare for the polls."There is urgent need to have clarity on the future of the commission. We are in a critical phase," he said.Chiloba said the 14-member parliamentary committee needs to fast-track electoral reforms once member names are approved by the House business committee."The debate of credibility is welcome because we need to close that chapter and focus on preparing for the general election," he added.Parliament is set to debate the names of MPs nominated by Jubilee and Cord to sit in the joint committee on IEBC reforms.The proposed names will be debated concurrently and approved separately, before the committee embarks on its mandate.The names were proposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Cord leader Raila Odinga following weeks of stand off over the composition of the IEBC.Chiloba further asked parties to conduct free and fair nominations to ensure all people are fairly represented."One of the weakest links in Kenyan elections is party candidate nominations," he noted."This is because politicians greatly influence the registration process and many citizens move from one electoral zone to another."To ensure fairness in the nominations, Chiloba said the electoral body is considering setting time limits for voter transfers."The mandate to resolve party nomination disputes is spelt out in the constitution and IEBC will undertake it," he said.
