Political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi has said he sent back on Monday the Sh12.5 million paid to his company by the National Youth Service.Ngunyi told the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday that he wired the money to Central Bank of Kenya.The vocal analyst explained how his firm, The Consulting House, received Sh102.5 million from two contracts awarded in the Sh791 million NYS fraudulent transactions.He said his firm was entitled to Sh90 million based on the value of the two contracts.Ngunyi said he thought the over-payment was from a different client as its source was not indicated. "The sneaking of funds into the account was a malicious attempt to derail NYS restructuring efforts," he said."I wrote to the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs questioning the payments for which they had not invoiced my company but did not get a response."The political analyst is still being questioned by the committee.Ngunyi appeared today after failing to honour the summons last week on Wednesday.Committee chairman Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo said they contacted him using an old email address.Read: PAC orders Ngunyi to refund Sh12.5m plus interest to NYSAlso read: Mutahi Ngunyi s firm ready to refund Sh11.8m excess payments if proved to be from NYS
