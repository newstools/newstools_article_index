Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua has told Nyeri MPs and MCAs he will not trade words with them. The county chief, who survived an impeachment attempt on September 14, said he will invest his energy in projects. Gachagua spoke to Gukena FM on Wednesday evening. This was his first public comment since the Senate unanimously voted against the impeachment motion. It said his wrongdoing did not reach the level of impeachment. The impeachment [debate] is now over. Let us work together for the sake of Nyeri people. The MPs should also focus on work in their constituencies and not blame the governor all the time, Gachagua said. He urged MCAs to pass the Sh6.4 billion budget so the county will have funds from January. The county is operating on half budget after the governor failed to assent to the financial estimate. He said the MCAs mutilated the plan forwarded by the executive. Nyeri majority leader Duncan Gituanja says MCAs will only work with the executive if the governor assents to the budget as passed by the house.
