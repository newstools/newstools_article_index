A high level government committee will begin negotiations with IEBC commissioners on Wednesday to facilitate their exit from office. The committee includes representatives from Treasury, Salaries and Remuneration Commission, the AG s office and the Interior and Public Service ministries.Government spokesman Erick Kiraithe said the team will chart an orderly and dignified exit package for the nine commissioners.Embattled IEBC commissioners formally agreed to resign in August, ending several tumultuous months of political confrontation and violent demonstrations.The commissioners said they will step aside in the interests of the country if they receive a "dignified" send-off package.They set two other conditions; that they not be investigated any further for alleged wrongdoing and that secretariat staff be retained for continuity in organising the poll.Kiraithe said in a statement on Tuesday that the inter-agency committee will further ensure a seamless transition within the commission.He added that the discussions with the commissioners will be undertaken within the confines of the law.The spokesman said the government noted that the new Election Laws (Amendment) Act takes effect from October 4. President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Act on September 14. Itintroduces a wide range of electoral reforms including a new framework for the recruitment of IEBC commissioners.More on this: Uhuru assents to Election Laws bill, sets stage for IEBC team exitKiraithe said: The government recognises the urgency that accompanies the ongoing transition process, and the need to recruit and bring on board new commissioners as soon as possible, he said."The government remains committed to pursuing an expedited process and looks forward to the cooperation of IEBC commissioners in the spirit of moving Kenya forward."Read: IEBC won t exit just yet as pay talks go onAlso read: Muturi heaps blame on Treasury, SRC over slump on IEBC team exit
