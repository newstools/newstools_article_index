The driver of the Ongata Line Sacco matatu that killed four people on Langata Road was granted a Sh1 million bond on Tuesday.But Francis Kinyanjui will be detained for 14 days to give police time to complete investigations into the September 25 accident. The bond will apply after this period.The prosecution argued that they needed the time to gather witness statements and allow victims to fill P3 forms.They further said the detention will keep the accused from being lynched by members of the public. Magistrate Barbara Ojoo noted the security risk but granted the bond saying it was Kinyanjui's right.Kinyanjui was charged on Monday with five counts of causing by dangerous driving.He was also charged with driving without a licence, operating an unroadworthy vehicle and failing to report an accident.The man also faced several other counts of causing injuries to passengers and an alternative charge of failing to carry a driver's licence.The prosecution had objected his release on bond saying he fled from the scene of the accident.More on this: Killer Rongai matatu driver charged with five counts of causing death
