Farmers in Eldoret plan to protest to force the government to buy maize at Sh3,200 per bag from the current Sh2,300.Kenya Farmers Association director Kipkorir Menjo said they will start the protests on Monday, if the state fails to increase the prices.Also present was Kenya National Farmers Union chairman Musa Barno. The farmers said they will lose a lot of money if the National Cereals and Produce Board continues to buy their produce at low prices. This year farmers have faced major challenges due to the low prices, Menjo said.Barno and Menjo said middlemen are taking advantage of the situation to exploit farmers. Two weeks ago, Agriculture CS Willy Bett directed that NCPB opens its depots in readiness to purchase the maize.Early opening of the board depots will help stop exploitation by middlemen. But they are yet to open and start buying maize.
