Insurance penetration in the local market has worsened for the third year in a row, dropping to 2.79 per cent last year from 2.94 in 2014, according to the Association of Kenya Insurers data.The lobby group, which released the industry report yesterday, said despite the decline, the local insurance industry is among the best performing in Africa, adding that the rising interest shown by foreign investors is due to the industry s high growth potential.According to the data released last week by industry regulator Insurance Regulatory Authority, market penetration for this sub-sector stood at 3.4 per cent in 2013 and 3.3 per cent in 2012.Insurance penetration is the ratio of total premium underwritten to the country s Gross Domestic Product in a given year. You will appreciate that even as it continues to grow, the insurance industry is operating in a constantly changing environment, said AKI chairman Patrick Tumbo in a speech read on his behalf by vice chairman Hassan Bashir during the release of the lobby group s report yesterday.A similar report by IRA shows there were 51 licensed insurance companies operating in the market last year, while reinsurance firms were three.The number of agents, IRA said, increased to 6,428 in 2015 excluding bancassurance agents from about 4,000 in the previous year.Globally, the average insurance penetration is 6.5 per cent, meaning Kenya is performing below par.In May, fund management firm Cytonn Investments said in a report that increased penetration for the industry can be fast-tracked using bancassurance model, where underwriting firms tap banks to sell insurance products to their clients.The firm called on the industry to come up with relevant products and convenient customer engagement channels.Oxford Business Group said in a recent report on the insurance industry that the sub-sector can hit four per cent penetration by end year due to the growing middle class. Expansion will be further supported by the introduction of new products to the market, states the report released in June.
