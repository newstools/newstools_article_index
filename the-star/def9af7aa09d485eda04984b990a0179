Lamu county assembly speaker Hashim Fumo has urged Governor Issa Timamy to re-joinin the Jubilee Party. He said JP leadership is better in ensuring development, compared to the opposition. Timamy s return to ANC is political suicide, Fumo said.Timamy had decamped to Jubilee last month but later returned to ANC, which is led by Musalia Mudavadi. Timamy was elected on an ANC ticket in 2013. Fumo cautioned Timamy that remaining in the opposition will hurt his reelection bid.In a press statement yesterday, the speaker said he is in JP to stay and the opposition has no future in Lamu county.He said Timamy s move won t undermine Jubilee Party s popularity.
