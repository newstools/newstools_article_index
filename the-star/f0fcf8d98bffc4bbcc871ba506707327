Some youth on Saturday parked a car carrying the body at a trading centre and went drinking, delaying the funeral of elder Mbiti Mwambulo as mourners waited for the cortege to arrive.Mwambulo was the father of Tulanduli assistant chief Mutinda Mbiti.Kamuwongo assistant county commissioner Anthony Mwangi reprimanded the youth. Speaking during the burial in Tulanduli village, Mwangi said it was wrong for the youth to drink and derail funeral proceedings. I was awfully disappointed when I found the vehicle carrying the body of the deceased parked at Kamuwongo trading centre, as those escorting it drank beer, he said.Mwangi also cautioned against driving while drunk.
