Members of the Gachiege EAPC church in Ntima West ward, Imenti North Constituency have banned MCA Samson Thuranira from attending any of the church s services.They alleged that the county legislator insulted Pastor Joshua Mwenda by calling him Kumbaffu - translates to stupid.Thuranira is alleged to have insulted the pastor after the latter sidelined him in plans for a fundraiser for the church.It is said the pastor worked with Edwin Bundi - the MCA's rival - for the harambee attended by Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi as the guest of honor.Jeremy Kiogora, one of the church's leaders, said the MCA has also opposed attempts by the church to secure bursaries for the orphaned and vulnerable children."Thuranira should forget ever addressing a meeting in this church for calling our pastor 'Kumbafu'," Kiogora said."I have no apologies to make because he has sealed all the loopholes and avenues that can be used to help our vulnerable children," the church leader said.The MCA seems to be facing stiff opposition from his rivals after North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood urged that he is voted out in the 2017 polls.The MP said he has mobilised all aspirants opposing Thuranira to join Jubilee Party so that they nominate a strong candidate who will easily win."In 2017, I have told him to forget the seat of MCA. I want to rally all the aspirants in this ward to go for nomination so that we can have a strong candidate who will take him home. Forgive him but don t pray for him," Rahim said.But Thuranira denied insulting the pastor as alleged by the group, saying the claims are unfounded."Nothing like that happened and I never insulted anybody. If they continue with such reports I will consider suing them in a court of law for tarnishing my name. Those are their falsehoods," said Thuranira.
