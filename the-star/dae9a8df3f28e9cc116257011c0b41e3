The Kenyatta National Hospital has set aside Sh150 million to put up a 62-bed hostel for cancer patients next year. The three-storey hostel will be built with the support of the American Cancer Society.It aims to accommodate outpatients, who flock to the hospital from other counties for radiotherapy and chemotherapy. An estimated 3,000 patients start their treatment at the hospital every year.Head of Pain and Palliative Care Unit Esther Munyoro said most patients come to Nairobi for the first time and have to spend the night in the corridors for fear of being mugged.
