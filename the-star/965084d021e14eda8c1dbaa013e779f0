State House has warned Governors to avoid making decisions on national issues without consulting the relevant arms of the national government.In a press briefing on Sunday, Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said no governor has sovereign power to consult on matters of national importance without involving the relevant arms of government.&quot;Governors should understand clearly that they do not run sovereign states and cannot hold discussions with sovereign government entities in another country without, in the first instance, consultations with our foreign ministry, and importantly, authorities in the countries in which they wish to engage.&quot; Esipisu said.Esipisu was reacting to Meru Governor Peter Munya&#39;s move to have consultative meetings with the government of semi-autonomous &nbsp;Somaliland last week which led to cancellation of miraa flights to Somalia.&nbsp;&quot;Whatever his intentions, good or otherwise, Mr Munya went and held discussions with a regional administration, without the knowledge of the Federal Government of Somalia, or indeed, without any consultations whatsoever or advise from the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in which the mandate to manage our foreign relations is vested.&quot; Manoah stated. He said that the governement of Somalia interpreted Munya&#39;s visit as to mean that&nbsp;the Kenyan Government&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;Somaliland as an independent state and hence took the decision to ban Miraa imports from Kenya.&nbsp;Citing the incident, Esipisu cautioned governors&nbsp;against engaging sovereign government entities in without consulting the foreign ministry and authorities in the countries in which they wish to engage.&ldquo;Talking to governments takes a certain decorum and protocol. It is not like talking to a private enterprise. County governments are regional administrations in the Republic of Kenya. They do not hold sovereign power,&rdquo; Esipisu said.&ldquo;As Governor Munya&rsquo;s lesson shows, decisions taken without proper consultations or advise end up causing crises and discomfort when there is really no reason for either,&rdquo; he added.He assured industry players that the matter was resolved after President Uhuru Kenyatta held talks with his Somali counterpart Hassan Sheikh Mohamaod &lsquo;and assured him that Kenya did not recognize any breakaway regions of Somalia, and emphasized that this confusion was caused by a governor whose understanding of foreign relations is at best ill informed&rsquo;.
