Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has denied he is running for a Senate seat. He said he will defend his parliamentary position. Those who think the Senate is the best place to be should themselves run, he said.Kuria said he is tired of some people trying to run Gatundu through a remote control and calling on him to run for the Senate.He said he can easily run for the Senate or even governor s and win, but there are more important things which need to be done in Gatundu. Like the Biblical Nehemiah, I am busy building a wall to secure Gatundu South. Those coming here with empty promises can only be compared to Nehemiah s enemies Sanballat and Tobiah, who plotted to attack Jerusalem and create confusion when Nehemiah was rebuilding a wall to secure the city. Listen to them but make the right decision when the time comes, Kuria said. He spoke at Kahuguiini Secondary School in his constituency on Wednesday.
