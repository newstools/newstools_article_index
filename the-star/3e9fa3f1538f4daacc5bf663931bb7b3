The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority will give its recommendation on Kenya Airways in a month s time, in wake of rising technical hitches that have caused safety concerns.KCAA director general Gilbert Kibe yesterday said the authority is studying the case raised by the Kenya Airline Pilots Association on the airline s incapacitated technical department, which has been dealt a blow by a mass exodus of engineers.At least 50 engineers have resigned from the airline code-named KQ this year, with more set to leave. Kalpa had in a letter dated August 31, written to Kibe, requesting him to look into the matter, which could affect the airline's safety record. We are studying the claims and we shall refer back to them. We have officers on the assignment. We should have answers within a month, Kibe told the Star.He said the authority has received complains not only from Kalpa but other institutions and individuals, concerning safety issues regarding different air services. We are generally concerned about the entire industry and KQ is one of them, he said.Last week, transport Principal secretary Irungu Nyakera revealed that three committees: human resource, risk and assurance committees have been set up to conduct a survey on KQ, which will inform the necessary changes.KQ has suffered several flight delays and air turn backs recently blamed on technical hitches. Among the incidences is last Wednesday where a Juba-bound flight was delayed for hours due to a technical hitch.On August 23, KQ 761 from Johannesburg to Nairobi was forced to make a U-turn after developing problems mid-air as it entered Zimbabwe s airspace."Resignations have become the order of the day and moreso within the technical department. This is a very critical department, and this high attrition has led to a galore of flight cancellations, aircraft technical issues and even air turn turnbacks," KALPA letter dated August 31, signed by its secretary general Captain Paul Gichinga.
