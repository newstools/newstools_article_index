The Vihiga Governor will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to respond to a petition filed by 12 MCAs to have him investigated for corruption.The committee last Tuesday resolved to write to Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko to order the governor s arrest for ignoring Senate summons.Akaranga said he is willing to obey the summons. Lawyers are currently engaging the DPP to explain that the governor did not snub summons and he wants more time to prepare, communications chief Peter Athiaya said.Vihiga Senator George Khaniri on Friday asked Akaranga to honour the summons as the consequences could be dire.He said governors are attempting to block the Senate from performing its duties.Khaniri countersigned the petition to the Senate by 12 MCAs on February 15.The petitioners are Andrew Ahuga, David Ogova, Gladys Analo, Joshua Olao, Nathan Kamidi and Peter Amuhinda.Others are Bernard Kiwanuka, Josephat Munayi, Pamela Amunga, Richard Muhiga, Venna Kaisha and Wycliffe Mosini.They are the only ones out of the assembly s 25 members who supported a report that implicated Akaranga s administration in corruption last year.The 12 want the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, DPP and DCI to conduct a joint forensic audit of the county s finances.The MCAs also want the EACC to carry out a lifestyle check on all executives, as well as investigate their bank accounts and property.Those who benefited from corrupt proceedings should be punished and property acquired llegally seized, they say.
