The launch of the Jubilee Party, instability in Cord and amendments to the election law on party hopping have been a gift to ANC, party leader Musalia Mudavadi has said.It is understood that most of MPs and MCAs left without a party following the dissolution of UDF and New Ford Kenya have joined ANC.Lamu Governor Issa Timamy and MPs Yusuf Chanzu, Alfred Agoi, John Bunyasi and Alfred Sambu have joined ANC. There is almost a trooping of colours of sorts, as even the unlikely seek enrolment. The vetting process is vigorous to weed out political ruffians after which ANC is planning a big welcome party in Nairobi, Mudavadi said in a statement.The new members will be issued with life membership certificates, allowing them to contest in ANC nominations. Mudavadi said JP is a hoax. There is no party called Jubilee Party. It is JAP that wanted a change of name but it has yet to fulfil the registration conditions, he said. Those who dissolved their parties were tricked, cheated. As we speak, they are running naked like witches at night looking for parties to join. He said the Luhya community will not be a swing vote as it is not an abstract number to be added arbitrarily to someone s vote tally .
