Gatanga MP Humphrey Njuguna has termed the law barring party hopping after primaries "unconstitutional and high-handed".He said hopefuls should be allowed to move to other parties if the primaries are not free and fair.Njuguna said there will be no democracy, if they will be restricted from joining other parties. We know there has never been democracy in party nominations and I m a product of this. In 2013, I won the TNA ticket and it was handed to me only to be repossessed after three days. I vied on a Narc ticket and won. I m only advocating for people who might undergo the same scenario I was in, he said. Njuguna spoke at Kiangigi Primary school in Gatanga on Friday.He said people will throng the courts after the nominations to seek repeals of the law that was passed by the National Assembly late last month.
