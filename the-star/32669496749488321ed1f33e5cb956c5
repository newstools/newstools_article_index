I realised how important it is to have a cordial working relationship with the governor. My people are enjoying good and improved water supply. Others should follow suit and come to good terms with the governor for the sake of Kiambu residents and developments, because whether we like it or not Kabogo remains the governor of Kiambu, Munyua said.The MP said rivalry has dragged the county behind in development.
