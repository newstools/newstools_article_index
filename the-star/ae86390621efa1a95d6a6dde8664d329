National Olympics Committee of Kenya treasurer Fridah Shiroya got a reprieve yesterday after she was cleared of any wrongdoing over the mismanagement of the country s team at the Rio 2016 Olympics.Shiroya , who was under probe over alleged theft of uniforms and allowances meant for athletes who represented the country in the Rio Games in Brazil, walked out of court a free woman after the prosecution asked court to close her file . Investigations that had been initiated against her have been completed. We are asking this court to close her file as we no longer intend to press charges against her, Chief magistrate Daniel Ogembo was told.Ogembo, consequently marked the file as closed and directed the Sh200,000 cash bail she deposited a month ago to be reimbursed with immediate effect.The new development came as Shiroya s colleagues head of team Kenya to Rio Stephen Soi, Secretary general Francis Kinyili Paul and first vice-chairman Pius Ochieng' were arraigned in court to face charges. The three, however, did not plead because a charge sheet presented before the magistrate was defective. The three, who are each out on a cash bail of sh 200,000, will be formally charged today. The magistrate told the prosecution to amend the charges and be ready to proceed. Shiroya will be a key witness in the trial of the Noc-k officials. Last week, the court heard that she has cooperated with investigators, a move that led to her file being closed.According to Senior prosecutor Duncan Ondimu, Shiroya has been giving valuable information and has cooperated fully with the police."Your honour, we are asking the court to dispense orders requiring her to report to the director of criminal investigation headquarters. She is likely to be a prosecution witness," Ondimu told the court.The group was booked over offences relating to abuse of office, neglect of duty and theft of kit meant for team in the Rio Olympic Games held in August.The Noc-k officials were arrested following pressure from the public over the manner in which the international games were managed.
