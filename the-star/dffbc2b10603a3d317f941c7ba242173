Dickson Chumba, who went into the race as the defending champion, was dethroned and came in second in a time of 2:11:26 despite displaying a spirited fight to retain the crown in the 42 kilometer race. At some point, it appeared like the 29 year old s dream would come true when he gallantly made Kirui to sweat it out with him in the last kilometer, but Kirui managed to pull away and held onto the lead to the tape, capping his win with a majestic dance.Gideon Kipketer came in third with a time of 2:12:20 ahead of compatriot Paul Lonyangata who registered a time of 2:13:17.Lonyangata had earlier in the race attempted to sprint away at the 25 kilometer mark, but his efforts resulted into a little more like a failed pace-setting attempt as he failed to shake off the chasing pack. Lonyangata, 24, eventually gave up the fight with a few miles to the 40 kilometer mark and never recovered. Compatriot Stephen Sambu stretched home behind him with a time of 2:13:35 to finish fifth. On the women side, world champion Florence Kiplagat defended her crown in style, the second woman to do so in the competition, coming home in a time of 2:21:32.She replicated Kirui's performance by leading a 1-2-3-4 sweep for the ladies.Edna Kiplagat came in second with a time of 2:23:28 followed closely by Valentine Kipketer who clocked 2:23:41.
