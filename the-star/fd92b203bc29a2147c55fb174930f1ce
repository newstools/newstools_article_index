The Director of Public Prosecutions has applied for a case to continue in the absence of Mombasa Republican Council leader Omar Mwamnuadzi.Principal prosecution counsel Jami Alexander told Mombasa chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti the case should continue because Mwamnuadzi s whereabouts are unknown. He said the court should consider the plight of the suspects arrested alongside him.On August 14, the court summoned Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko to explain Mwamnuadzi s whereabouts. Sonko was a surety in the case in which Mwamnuadzi is charged with having a firearm and several bullets.He was summoned to explain Mwamnuadzi s whereabouts when the MCR leader skipped court. The magistrate issued a warrant of arrest. Both summons were to be effected by the Kwale Directorate of Criminal Investigations.However, lawyer Jared Magolo said there was no need to summon Sonko if the case could proceed without Mwamnuadzi. He said he would ensure the senator appears to explain Mwamnuadzi s whereabouts.Mwamnuadzi faces another charge, alongside his wife Maimuna Hamisi, of having offensive weapons. They also face two counts of incitement to violence and having material used in witchcraft. The couple is charged alongside 34 people accused of consorting with an armed person.
