There was fun at the fourth edition of BLAZE Summit held at the Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi on Friday.Powered by Safaricom, the event followed successful summits in Eldoret, Thika and Nakuru that hosted an estimated 20,000 youth for mentorship.During the day-long summit, there were different pod sessions offering mentorship on various areas ranging from business, social enterprise, agriculture, entertainment, sports and arts. As a mentor, I learn more and more from the attendees and Nairobi was no different."I have been made aware of not only the potential of youth in Kenya, but I have also gotten into partnerships that I know will continue to grow my business, said 24-year-old Fashion Torch Africa CEO Wilkins Fadhili.Besides mentorship, attendants were entertained by a number of artistes among them King Kaka, Femi One, Khaligraph Jones, Timmy Tdat and DJs Creme De La Creme and JR.Two more summits are scheduled to be held in Mombasa and Kisumu consecutively.See the photos from the event below.Rapper Khaligraph Jones on the stage.DJ Creme.Sharon Mwangi, Shaq the Young'in' and Anita Nderu.Patricia Kihoro and comedian Karis.King Kaka.Rapper Femi One with Shamilla Kiptoo.Drummer Olive Karmen and hip hop promoter Buddha Blaze.Radio and TV personality Mwende Macharia.Mosez Dance Agency.Photos/MOSES MWANGI
