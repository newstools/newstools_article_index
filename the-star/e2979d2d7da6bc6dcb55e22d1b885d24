This will be a letter to tell the prospective employer that although the person was convicted and jailed, they petitioned the president and were pardoned after they were vetted and found to have fully reformed, Pomac CEO Michael Kagika said. It will be telling the potential employer that this is a person we would vouch for to be hired after a successful petition and assessment to help them hasten integration back into society after the pardon. Anyone who has been convicted of a criminal offense is not eligible for the letter. Those with pending criminal proceedings are also not eligible for the crucial document.Assistant Commissioner General of Prisons David Macharia supported the proposal.
