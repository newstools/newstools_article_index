A child died in Siaya on Monday after consuming poisonous cassava, barely three weeks after four others died under similar circumstances.Mercy Akoth, 12, of Siandha A village, Ramula sub-county in Siaya is said to have consumed the deadly cassava with her two other siblings.The Ramula primary school pupils siblings Benta Adhiambo, 9, and Christopher Omondi, 6, luckily survived after they were treated at Ramula hospital. East Gem Chief Nicholas Sogo said the meal had been prepared by their grandmother Petronela Aketch, 67.The children started complaining of stomachache after midnight before they were rushed to the nearby hospital where Akoth died."I rushed them to hospital at around 3 am but it was unfortunate that there were no personnel to attend to them. Mercy passed on before we could be assisted," the children's mother said. A neighbour told the Star that the granny was not aware that the cassavas she prepared were poisonous. She said the plant had just grown on the old lady's farm wildly. "She thought that the plant was a normal cassava. She uprooted some and ignorantly prepared for her grandchildren," the neighbour said.Isaac Munyendo, county director of agriculture, earlier said that they will train residents on proper use of cassava to avert such deaths.Cassava crop which is highly rich in starch contains cyanide poison which can be poisonous to humans if consumed in high amount.Read: Four children die after consuming poisonous cassava in Siaya
