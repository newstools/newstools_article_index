Tetu MP Ndung u Gethenji has called for the prosecution of Kenya Airways top managers over alleged mismanagement of more than Sh50 billion.He said billions have been lost in the national carrier, which has been recording losses, despite huge injection of funds by the government. If those who mismanaged the NYS money are in court, even those mismanaging the national carrier should be prosecuted, starting with CEO Mbuvi Ngunze. Billions in taxpayers money has been lost, Gethenji said.The MP said the government, being the major shareholder, must demand accountability and transparency.Gethenji spoke in Gatumbiro village, Tetu, on Saturday. He was accompanied by former Nation Media Group CEO Linus Gitahi.Gitahi, however, differed with the lawmaker, accusing the government and Kenyans of neglecting the airline, leading to the huge losses.He said most politicians and government officials use foreign airlines for their international tours and later blame the KQ management for the losses. Recently, Rwanda launched its own airline and her President ordered all civil servants to be using it for abroad travels. Dubai started Emirates and they assisted it in making profits, Gitahi said. KQ managers cannot be blamed, because the company has been neglected by the government and Kenyans. He urged the government to offer the national carrier practical support. The state must make a strategic decision to lift the airline, Gitahi said.He said firing managers will not solve the problem. On Friday, shareholders rapped the government for threatening the airline s managers and using its muscle on the board to alter its composition. The results of the vote will be published on Wednesday.
