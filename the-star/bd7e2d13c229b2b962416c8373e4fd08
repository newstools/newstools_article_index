The Education ministry may be forced to install CCTV cameras in all public boarding secondary schools to help curb students unrest and indiscipline.A motion awaiting debate and approval by MPs when they resume from recess on October 4 seeks to pile pressure on the government to "speedily roll out" installation of Closed Circuit Television cameras in strategic locations in the schools to beef up security surveillance.Kathiani MP Robert Mbui, who filed the motion, argues cases of arson in boarding schools have been high this year because most perpetrators who go unpunished take advantage of lack of the cameras to commit acts."If arson is left unabated, this trend will turn dormitories in public boarding secondary schools to death traps for innocent students and expose school properties to the risk of arbitrary destruction by riotous students yet it is the government's duty to preserve the lives of innocent students and school property from the incessant threat of arson," reads the motion.More than 100 schools had fire incidents this year whose main cause was linked to arson by students. The incidents led to more than 6, 000 students being sent home before school calender for second term lapsed while 15 school heads are under investigation.Education CS Fred Matiang'i and his Interior counterpart Joseph Nkaissery on July 20 formed an eight-member joint investigation team to unravel the cause of the fires. The team was given one month to conduct the inquiry and its report is expected this week. Mbui, in his motion, wants students transferring from one school to another subjected to thorough screening before being admitted to nab perpetrators of arson evading responsibility."The government should roll out an enhanced security mechanism for surveillance of students activities, makes provisions for regular and mandatory checks to confirm compliance and enforcement of the mechanism," the motion reads.The Kathiani MP also wants Education ministry put in place stringent admission laws to be enforced fully by school principals. "The government should ensure strict admission criteria is enforced, including maintenance of a profile of alleged perpetrators of arson to ensure that they do not escape liability by transferring to other schools without proper screening," it adds.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi will refer the motion,once adopted by the House, to Committee on Implementation chaired by Narok woman representative Soipan Tuya to ensure the Education ministry implements the resolutions.
