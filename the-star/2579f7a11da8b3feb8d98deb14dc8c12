Anyang' Nyong'o has dismissed claims he did not hand over to Ababu Namwamba when the latter took over as ODM secretary general.Nyong'o, who is Kisumu Senator, said the claim by Budalang'i MP Ababu were "disingenuous and false".He said in a statement on Tuesday that he has had an open-door policy for consultations with Ababu since he took over.The Senator said at no time did the secretary general, who has threatened to quit, inform him of the handicaps he is now churning out."I am tempted to conclude that Ababu Namwamba is on some fishing expedition to find faults with ODM and its leadership," he said.Ababu had complained of frustration since becoming ODM secretary general about 18 months ago.He threatened to quit saying he joined the opposition party believing the people's personal and national dreams would be fulfilled."If the dreams of the people of Busia are not getting fulfilled in this party, we will make a different decision," he said in Bukalama.More on this: Ababu threatens to quit ODM post, Otuoma drops vice chairman seatAbabu got off the public limelight for weeks raising concerns that he had decamped to Jubilee or that Cord wanted him out.
