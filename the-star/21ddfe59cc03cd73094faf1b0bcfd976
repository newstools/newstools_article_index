An additional Sh600m will be used to refurbish the Kenyatta University hostels in readiness for next year s IAAF World Under-18 Championships.Cabinet secretary for sports Hassan Wario said the amount is an addition to the Sh2billion initially factored for the event to necessitate an upgrade into a five star hotel facility.The event is set for between July 12 and 16 next year. Wario said a Rapid Response Committee will be formed to fast-track or tackle pending issues especially the additional budgets.While confirming that the government has already released the funds for the project, Wario said: All the procurement processes should be done within the coming week and everything should be running by the end of October. He added that the government is ready to fund the KU village since IAAF has promised to turn it into a High Performance Training Centre. I shall seek the help from education ministry to boost renovations at Kenyatta University to make it a world class athletes training centre, said Wario.Only last week, Local Organising Committee CEO Mwangi Muthee revealed that the IAAF would only transform the varsity into an HPTC if only the government would commit to ensuring the university is transformed into a facility of high standards, befitting that of an Under-18 Championships village. All the rooms at Kenyatta University will be renovated with the facility benefiting from the same competition and warm up tracks that will be laid at Kasarani, said Muthee adding that the Village will have full-fledged ultra-modern equipment including a modern running track. A borehole will be sunk near the competition venue to address water issue, said Muthee adding that IAAF technical delegates will be in the country between October 16 and 20 to start the renovations.Meanwhile, the Moi International Sports Stadium will have most of it s facilities locked down at the end of next month to necessitate the earmarked renovations.Local and IAAF engineers led by Cristian Burril from Italian track manufacturer, Mondo, have already visited Kasarani where a blue tartan will be laid as well as KU.
