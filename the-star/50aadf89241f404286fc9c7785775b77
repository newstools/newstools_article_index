Nominated Senator Naisula Lesuuda has asked DCI and NCIC to question opposition leader Raila Odinga for allegedly issuing inciting remarks.Lesuuda said on Tuesday that the Cord chief's remarks to Narok residents on Saturday amounted to hate speech as he allegedly asked the public to prepare their bows and arrows for a storm to the IEBC. Police should arrest the Cord leader and launch investigations into his remarks, she said at Baragoi Primary School during the issuing of laptops to class one pupils.Raila is said to have issued the remarks during a rally in Narok town, with regard to the forceful removal of IEBC commissioners.He had accused the Jubilee government of slowness in the process of hiring a new team to replace the nine who negotiated their exit packages with representatives from several state organisations.Lesuuda said his remarks were uncalled for as he is a senior politicians who should not incite members of the public.She warned the country will not have peaceful elections if politicians like Raila are allowed to perpetrate hate speech and incitement.IEBC commissioners agreed to leave office upon the swearing in of new commissioners "to avoid a power vacuum and a consequent constitutional crisis".State House Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua reported this on September 30 saying the talks were guided by the need to strike a balance.The Head of Public Service declined to reveal what each IEBC commissioner will take home, saying this remains a highly guarded secret for the sake of the "privacy and security of the commissioners".More on this: IEBC strikes exit deal with government, agrees to oversee transition process
