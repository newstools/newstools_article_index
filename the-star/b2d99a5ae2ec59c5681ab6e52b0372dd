Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore has said leaders and citizens need to consider integrating refugees into the society.Collymore said those seeking asylum, most of whom are women and children, are just victims of larger conflicts and do not choose their state."This is not a matter of how we view refugees; it is about human rights and dignity. We really do not realise that we have so much within refugee camps and all we see is the negative side ... it is high time we change that," he said.Read: Repatriation of Somali refugees not reversible, Uhuru saysThe CEO spoke while remotely delivering a mentorship class to Kakuma and Dadaab-based students.He said the status of refugees required urgent response from stakeholders, as well as collective action to end conflict.But he also challenged refugees to use their education to uplift their livelihoods."Don't confine yourself into that 'refugee camp' mentality. You've got to use the education that we are offering you to [change] your situation because education is the only way to do so," he said.Collymore said Safaricom will empower youth in the camps with resources and motivation to ensure they can make a difference to their circumstances."We will use the instant school for Africa initiative to empower all young people in the refugee camps and motivate them so that they can appreciate themselves, because they surely need some dignity," he said.Also read: NGO council lashes out at state over forcible refugee repatriationThe instant schools for Africa initiative is a philanthropic programme that entails virtual teaching class and is delivered by the Vodafone Foundation.The programme, which started in May, has been running in Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps.The initiative provides millions of young people in the camps with free access to online learning materials, developed in conjunction with Learning Equality.Other partners in the initiative include Huawei and Vodafone, which provide gadgets such as tablets and smartphones to students and teachers in these regions so as to improve their learning experience.
