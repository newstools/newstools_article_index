Automating revenue collection has sealed corruption loopholes and increased county funds, Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said.Kabogo said before the automation, the county was collecting less than Sh1 billion annually, but this has increased to Sh4.7 billion. Our target is Sh11 billion. The government gives us Sh9 billion, but in the next seven years we will be independent of the national government to collect Sh15 billion. We will have Sh4 billion extra to upgrade our county to compete globally, he said. The automation project enables residents to pay for services through M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Visa and MasterCard. These payment methods, as well as e-procurement, have minimised tampering and fraud.Kabogo said some businesses have been moved from Nairobi to Kiambu.He said the county has created a good working environment to host thousands of businesses from Nairobi.They include companies and industries established across the county. Companies are moving from Nairobi to Kiambu county to capitalise on the good business environment, ample space, laws and infrastructure, Kabogo has said.The governor said the County Biashara Fund has helped promote entrepreneurship and trade. We will work closely with stakeholders to benefit from our policies, he said.
