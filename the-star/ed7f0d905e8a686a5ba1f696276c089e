Raila Odinga s ODM party has accused Musalia Mudavadi s Amani of defacing ODM s Sabatia office that was to be officially opened next Friday.Raila was to preside over its opening on Mudavadi s home turf and receive at least 300 defectors from Amani. This did not go down well with Mudavadi s supporters.But Vihiga county Amani secretary William Kaisha on Wednesday denied claims their supporters disfigured the office. Concerning the planned defection of our 300 members to ODM, we want to let you know we have registered 50,000 members in Sabatia constituency alone, so their exit is not a threat to us, Kaisha said.ODM director of political affairs Opiyo Wandayi and Vihiga nominated MCA Ben Ombima said Amani was threatened by the warm reception Raila got in Mbale a fortnight ago .On June 18, Raila was welcomed to Vihiga. An enthusiastic crowd that had jammed the Kisumu-Kakamega road with placards urged Cord leader to address them on his way to the Kakamega governor s office.Residents asked him to work with Mudavadi, and one placard bore the words: Raila for President. Musalia for Prime Minister . On Wednesday, Wandayi, the Ugunja MP, said the ODM office was defaced to undermine ODM s popularity. It is barbaric, undemocratic, retrogressive and amateurish, he said.
