Crime has slowed development in Mandera, a parliamentary committee was told.Governor Ali Roba said it compromises services and economic growth, preventing the county from achieving its goals.He cited terrorism, banditry, illegal immigrants, smuggling of illegal weapons, poor infrastructure and the porous Kenya-Somalia border. The county chief said criminals take advantage of the problems.Roba said last week most residents arm themselves because they feel unsafe. The county has suffered a number of attacks, mostly by al Shabaab militants. It has also experienced inter-clan clashes, with many deaths recorded.The Kenya Red Cross Society on June 23 said 16 people died and scores were injured in an attack in Choroqo.Local NGOs say the protracted tension and inter-community conflict is caused by competition for natural resources and political disagreements.Roba said, however, his administration has tried to improve the county s state of affairs.He singled out an increase in revenue collection. It is different from the previous years when the region was managed by municipal and urban authorities, Roba said.He told the Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee the county revised its initial revenue target to Sh150 million, but still did not meet it. Our target was Sh438 million, but we managed to collect Sh96 million by June 30, last year, after scaling it down to 150 million, Roba said. But I believe it was a good job, considering the challenges we face. The county boss told the committee they recruit underqualified staff because they lack professionals. The committee urged him to outsource from other counties.Meanwhile, with regard to the decision by some governors to ignore summons, chairman Anyang Nyong o said the Senate is performing its oversight role provided by the Constitution.Nyong o said the committee will continue with its mandate and told Roba to urge his colleagues to comply.
