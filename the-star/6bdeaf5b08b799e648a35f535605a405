One of the children went to wake her up but she did not respond. That is when the customer went in and said she was dead," said Nyalenda sublocation assistant chief David Rajoro.The child said their father attacked their mother after they quarreled. My father hit her and she fell on the ground. He then took her to the bedroom... I do not know what happened next. Since mum did not talk to us we went to bed," the boy said.Kisumu Central OCPD Peter Omwana said Omondi went missing after the incident was reported.The assistant chief encouraged the Nyumba Kumi Initiative saying this was the fourth such incident in the area.One case saw a man kill his wife and their two children before escaping.In another incident, a woman was tied with a mosquito net and burned in her own house.
