Not me, says DP RutoRuto wrote to Mwangi last Friday demanding an apology for a tweet the activist published linking him to the murder of businessman Jacob Juma. But Mwangi accused Ruto of singling him out of several other allegations of the DP's involvement in Juma's death."Is it not true that Honourable Cyrus Jirongo, a close friend, at one time of both, the late Jacob Juma, and your client pointed fingers at our client in connection with Juma's death?" Mwangi's lawyers asked.Also read: Jacob Juma made enemies online including RutoMwangi said the DP should prove his innocence in a court of law, especially after his case at the ICC where he had been charged with "grave crimes including murder".The activist also said he is cautious of death threats that may come his way for his continued fight for human rights."Our client has very real and compelling reasons for fearing that your client (Ruto) may wish to kill him and he reserves his right to disclose these in court should the need arise," the lawyers said.The letter said threats to Mwangi are aimed at silencing him, adding that they will prove to the court that the DP does not have a good reputation."Your client claims that his reputation ... [but] our client will seek to persuade the court that that he has no reputation worthy of the indulgence of a court of justice either in Kenya or elsewhere."
