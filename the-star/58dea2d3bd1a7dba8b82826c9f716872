There is grumbling from a section of parliamentary staff and it is just a matter of time before it implodes. The grumbling has been on since the Parliamentary Service Commission agreed to separate its services so as to reflect the National Assembly, Senate and Joint Services. The National Assembly is led by its Clerk, Justin Bundi, the Senate has Jeremiah Nyegenye, who is also the PSC secretary, while Director General Clement Nyandiere heads Joint Services. Though the PSC went ahead to split its Vote between the National Assembly and the Senate, Joint Services function was left out. This means that the staff who also work under Joint Services - the majority in the Security department, have been overlooked for many training opportunities outside the country. It is also a big issue because when it comes to allowances, there is always an argument between the two Houses about who should pay them.**********The power game within the Judiciary is not about to end anytime soon. A senior Judiciary official has taken to discrediting colleagues with the intention of edging them out of office. The official, known to direct rulings by one of the candidates recently interviewed by the Judicial Service Commission, is said to be the brains behind a petition filed against Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi seeking her removal from office. **********Just who is protecting an MD of a Nakuru-based parastatal who has just started his third term in office? Although the Board had directed that the MD be dismissed, the chairman secretly renewed his contract. The two are accused of mismanaging the Board and complaints from contractors, employees, community members, politicians and stakeholders, have fallen on deaf ears. The MD has been excluding the Board of directors from any ongoing projects and they have not visited any of the multi-billion-shilling project sites. **********An aspirant for the Nairobi governor position who was recently endorsed as a candidate in chaotic fashion at a popular pub along the Thika Superhighway, contrary to community tradition, is in trouble. It is said the act of taking fake elders to the pub to endorse him has occasioned a bad omen against him. The man is said to be contemplating defending his parliamentary seat after his fortunes for his bid for governor dwindled. Those in the know say the man has realised he is not as popular as he thought and while he was going out campaigning, a young man is said to have won supporters back in his constituency so much so that even if he tried defending his seat, he will not make it. The genuine community elders now want him to appease the gods so that he is cleansed and accepted back to the fold.
