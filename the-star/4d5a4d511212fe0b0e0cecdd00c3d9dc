If you are planning to conceive, then you need to be very particularly about what you eat.Conception actually requires a change in lifestyle as well as taking care of your body.Gynaecologist Frank Kagema says you need to move away from fast foods and stop eating junk."You need to start going for foods which are rich in fruits and vegetables and plant based form of diet,more of a vegetarian diet," said Kagema.He also says one should avoid red meat and eat more of white meat such as chicken and fish.Weight reduction is also key especially for individuals who are too obese or overweight when one is planning to conceive.Kagema says this might as well hinder you from conceiving."That means regular exercise and a good diet is essential to help in weight reduction as you need to be healthy and in good shape when you conceive," said Kagema.Kagema says one also needs to avoid addiction to cigarette smoking and alcohol."Smoking includes all forms of tobacco including Shisha and if someone also takes drugs such as heroine or cocaine,they need to avoid this," he said.For those on medication for any form of illness like diabetes or high blood pressure there's need to ensure the illness is well controlled."You need to use the right medication which will also sustain the pregnancy," the gynaecologist said.
