Three ODM Governors have threatened to sue the Jubilee government for what they termed economic marginalisation and sabotage.Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Evans Kidero (Nairobi) and Jack Ranguma (Kisumu) said they will seek an irreversible legal determination on the mattter.They said they will also organise sit-ins until President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto's Jubilee government takes action."The national government owes no less than Sh69 billion in rates and arrears that they have flatly refused to settle," read a joint statement sent to newsrooms on Saturday."(Uhuru and Ruto) are starving Nairobi of financial oxygen so as to reap from its socio-political ruins in 2017."Regarding devolution, the Governors said the government has "systematically implemented a scheme" to ensure the system does not work.They noted Kenyans approved the system when they voted to pass the constitution in 2010.The county chiefs further accused Uhuru of frustrating county governments by locking them out of government offices."In Mombasa for example, Joho had to hire private premises to house his government yet there are available and appropriate government buildings that Jubilee chose to allocate to junior officers," said the statement.They also complained about staff members, saying their counties have suffered because of inheriting national government teams.They further said they were forced to take over functions that were devolved yet they have not been given the money required.Read: Transition to county governance and implementation of devolutionAlso read: Why corruption is devolution's biggest enemyOf the Sh69 million the government owes Nairobi county, they said they want an "immediate disbursement" for use in equipping hospitals, low cost housing and water supply.They further said they want an immediate policy for sharing and disbursement of port revenue to Mombasa, and cessation of acts leading to the transfer of port operations from county.The Governors also called for an immediate temporary ban on importation of cheap fish from China and an investment plan to restore produce and markets for Lake Victoria."In Kisumu, the local economy is on its knee after Jubilee liberalised importation rules allowing the entry of cheap fish from China," they said in their statement."(This has been) to the detriment of local fishermen and thousands of families are now left destitute with no means to pay fees, pay for medical care and other basic needs."The three also touched on the controversial 'milk for sugar deal' with Uganda, saying it saw the local market flooded with cheap imports "effectively killing the industry" in Muhoroni, Awendo and other parts of Nyanza. "This deal was signed with no regard as to the net effect to farmers and their main source of income," they said. "This strategy of economic subjugation by Jubilee in our counties is diabolical and must cease forthwith as it goes against the spirit and the letter of the constitution."Ranguma told the national government in July to impose a 100 per cent ban on fish imports from China.He said there was no logic behind allowing the trade which has already affected the local fish market.Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo said importing Tilapia from China is a scheme by the government to kill the fishing industry in Kenya.Noting that the government has never bothered to develop fish industry, Gumbo condemned the move saying Kenya has the ability to be a chief exporter in the sector."We are not sure the Chinese tilapia is safe for human consumption," he added.Read: Ban fish imports from China, Ranguma asks national governmentAlso read: Nyanza MPs reject fish imports from China, say move will kill livelihoods
