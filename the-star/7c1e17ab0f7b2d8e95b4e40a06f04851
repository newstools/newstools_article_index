Former Water minister Mutua Katuku yesterday launched the People Trust Party gazetted two weeks ago.Katuku said the party intends to offer generational change in leadership and politics.The former Mwala MP said the birth of PTP was informed by the need to expand the democratic space and give Kenyans a chance to exercise their democratic rights."Dictatorship and impunity has been preferred by a large proportion of the country's leadership over the democracy thereby rendering political organisations the preserve of personality cults and a small clique of sycophants," Katuku said.He said majority of Kenyan citizenry has been isolated and ignored at national and local levels of public participation.Katuku said there was no consultation among parties.
