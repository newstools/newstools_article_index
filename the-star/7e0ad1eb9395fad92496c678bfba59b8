Kiambu woman representative aspirant Gladys Chania (pictured) has said being responsive to the people s needs should be among the factors considered for one to get into leadership. She said knowing what is happening across the county counts a lot in leadership.Chania was speaking during the graduation ceremony of 700 youths at the Zipped Society Vocational Training School in Kiuu ward, Ruiru constituency, on Saturday. Let us reach out to the constituents because they better understand their needs. No matter how involved you are as an individual, greater influence and impact are gained when a large number of your constituents speak with one voice, Chania said.The former Kiambu TNA coordinator and counsellor said communities should prioritise their needs for leaders to implement their projects and programmes effectively. We need massive transformation and empowerment for our people so they can fend for themselves. We should bury handouts, Chania said.She said the training school has helped youth who had dropped out of school and helped transform the community. If a vocational training school started by an individual can transform 700 youths in a ward, what can the Affirmative Action Social Development Fund do? With the right priorities, our people can feel the services, Chania said. She said the community needs can be best addressed through organised grassroots activities and servant leadership.
