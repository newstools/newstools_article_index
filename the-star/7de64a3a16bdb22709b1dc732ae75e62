Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has denied claims by some leaders he has endorsed candidates to vie for MP seats. Speaking in Kiambu town on Monday, he said he has not endorsed anyone and any candidate is free to run on any ticket, including the Jubilee Party. Kabogo said those spreading the propaganda are after personal interests. He said they are creating enmity between the people and Kiambu leaders. I do not have any preferred candidate and whoever is seeking to be elected, let him ask votes from the people, he said. Kabogo reaffirmed his support for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto. He said they are the only candidates he has endorsed. The governor said he is confident he will retain his seat. Kabogo is expected to face strong opposition from Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu. They have been embroled court battles over Waititu s academic qualifications. Some leaders said Kabogo has endorsed Morris Mburu for Thika Town MP, while others said he has endorsed incumbent Alice Ng ang a. This aimed to cause rivalry between the governor and aspirants.
