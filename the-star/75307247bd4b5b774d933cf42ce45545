Juja police have destroyed 1,800 litres of illicit brew along the River Athi in Juja Farm.Gachororo assistant county commissioner Priscilla Mutethya said the authorities found the liquor on Tuesday during a crackdown in the fight against outlawed liquor.Brewers fled when they spotted the officers.But Mutethya said five notorious brewers and distributors of the outlawed brews were arrested. We won t relent in the fight against illicit brews and the brewers will soon be brought to book, she said.The administrator said the brewers are slowly abandoning the outlawed trade due to the pressure mounted by police and county administrators. At the beginning of the year, we used to destroy not less than 13,000 liters of the concoction (Kangara) and chang aa and this has reduced to less than 2000 liters. This indicates that brewers have dropped the illegal activity, Mutethya said.She said the Nyumba Kumi members and the community policing officials have played a significant role in wiping out brews.Mutethya urged the brewers to shun the illicit business and instead start income generating activities, such as farming to keep them on the good side of the law. Instead of engaging the authorities in running battles along the rivers banks and in bushes, use the water for other meaningful purposes like farming, she said.A week ago, Juja deputy county commissioner Muthama Wambua praised team work of the police and the county administrators in the fight against brews.He said Mutethya is dedicated to wipe out the brews, despite fierce resistance and standoffs with brewers in the chang aa dens. In the last six months we have managed to wipe out chang aa from the banks of the River Ndarugu. We have started a serious operation to clear the brews along the River Athi, Wambua said.In July last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered a nationwide crackdown on killer brews.
