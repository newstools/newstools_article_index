The government is finalising plans to start local assembly of tablets to be used for learning in primary schools.The tentative launch date will be October 21. Information Communication Technology Authority director Robert Mugo said assembly will first take place at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.The local assembly is meant to complement the purchase from China of 1.2 million tablets for standard one pupils. It will eliminate the cost of importing complete gadgets.Six hundred thousand tablets are being imported from China, while the rest will be assembled locally by Moi University and JKuat.Mugo said, Experts have been secured to train other people who will be involved in the assembling at JKuat. He said semi-knocked-down parts are in the country.Launching the national tablets rollout to schools on September 28, ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru said 160,000 tablets were ready for delivery.He said assembly at JKuat will produce about 700,000 tablets per year.Moi University s assembly will be at its textile company, Rivatex. This will start later and produce the same number of tablets.The whole project is valued at Sh19 billion. The local assembling cost entails what the consortium has been allocated so they deliver complete gadgets, Mugo said.The consortium involves Moi University in partnership with Portugal s JP Couto, while JKuat is with Brazil and Argentine-based Positivo-BGH.He added that afterwards the local manufacture will diversify from tablets to computers and other related ICT demands.
