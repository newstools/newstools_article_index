Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi has supported the Bill requiring outgoing presidents, governors and other leaders to report on the state of affairs in their offices before they leave.Mudavadi, addressing the Vihiga county assembly on Thursday, said outgoing leaders should account for pending bills and assets.He said the Bill before the National Assembly will keep the country and counties in check and prevent leaders from hiding public property. The ANC leader urged MCAs to remain focused on their oversight role. The Auditor General s report condemns MCAs for absconding their mandate in favour of abetting the looting of public resources, he said.Mudavadi said the reckless manner in which assemblies manage their own budgets soils their image.Twenty-six out of 39 MCAs in the assembly won on the UDF ticket. The party was formerly associated with the presidential hopeful. The ward reps are yet to join ANC, despite UDF indicating it will dissolve to join the Jubilee Party.The former Vice President told the MCAs he had not gone there to endorse them. That is up to Vihiga voters, he said.Mudavadi later met Governor Moses Akaranga. He has intensified campaigning for his second stab at the presidency.He is seeking governors support and Akaranga is especially influential. The county boss urged Mudavadi to back his re-election. Akaranga accused Mudavadi s supporters of using the social media to denounce his support for him [Mudavadi].
