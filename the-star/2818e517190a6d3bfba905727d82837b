The Kiambu government has hired 1,081 nursery school teachers on permanent and pensionable terms in a bid to upgrade the education sector.On Saturday, Governor William Kabogo gave them employment letters.He said the county government is committed to prioritising education by improving employment terms of caregivers and improving infrastructure in the schools."I have no problem in the pending case in court regarding employment of the ECDE teachers, as employment in the county is a mandate of the public service board. The PSB members sat down with my cabinet and agreed that the problems in ECDE must be solved. We will not wait anymore," Kabogo said.There is a case in court over prohibiting the county from hiring nursery school teachers.Kabogo instructed the PSB to hasten the process of making ECDE teachers permanent and pensionable employees.The governor urged the state to allow the county government to improve standard 1, 2 and 3 education in the same way the county government has improved nursery schools."My government has put more effort on education and if you look at the state of ECDEs in the county and the state of standard 1, 2 and 3, it is different," Kabogo said.County education chief officer Ann Gichohi said, "The caregivers deserve to be recognised and appreciated for their continued service to the county."She said the county plans to hire an additional 1,000 nursery school tutors.Kabogo said the county government will cater for the Sh300 paid by parents to the ECD centres for maintenance, hence making nursery school education free.He said the county will also improve infrastructure, especially sanitation facilities.The governor added that the county will continue supporting teh porridge feeding programme in ECDE centres.
