There is a plot to remove Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang ula as Ford Kenya leader, deputy party chief Boni Khalwale said yesterday. He said the scheme will not succeed.Khalwale said activist Ken Wafula who says he has been endorsed by some officials and elders to replace Wetang ula is not a member of Ford Kenya. From our records, Wafula vied for the Senate seat in Trans Nzoia in 2013 through Safina party. He has never defected to Ford Kenya. He is not a member and should keep off Ford Kenya affairs, he told the Star on the phone.Khalwale said Wafula is being used by some forces to give the impression Wetang ula is under siege. Let those doubting Wetang ula s popularity be patient and they will know the truth, because the elections are just around the corner, he said.Khalwale said no elder has endorsed Wafula. The Council of Elders in Bungoma has a clear structure of leadership and none of those structures or its leaders have said they support Wafula, he said.Wetang ula has been facing what appears to be growing rebellion in his party after 10 branches in the North Rift endorsed a plan to sack him.Officials said they are collecting signatures to sack Wetang ula at a special National Delegates Conference next month.Last week, Wafula met officials and they resolved to sack Wetang ula for allegedly mismanaging the party. The North Rift branches endorsed Wafula to take over as the interim party leader. A group of elders, led by Maruti Wabomba, also met in Webuye and endorsed Wafula.The North Rift officials who denounced Wetang ula include chairmen Caleb Arusei (Nandi), James Cox (Baringo), John Bunyasi (Uasi Gishu), and Elgeyo Marakwet secretary David Kanda.
