Samburu county residents want defilement and cattle rustling be included in the list of capital offence in the laws of Kenya.The residents were speaking at a public debate on death sentence and offences which constitute capital crime organized by the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee (POMAC) on Tuesday where they said that cattle rustling and defilement has become a thorn in the flesh in Samburu.Fred Kiragu, a local politician, said that cattle rustling has now been commercialized by criminals in the county and should be declared as a capital offence.He said that it is no longer a cultural practice like it was in the past but criminal cartels have turned to using guns to kill innocent people. If cattle rustling is included as a capital offence the punishment it will attract might deter the behavior in our county, Kiragu said.Maralal Township Nyumba Kumi chairman Solomon Wanyeki, an ex-prisoner said corruption should also be included as a capital offence in Kenya as it hinders the rehabilitation of inmates since they have an access to their criminal lifestyle while still in prison. Through corruption inmates have access to cigarettes, drugs and mobile phones which enable them to continue with their criminal ways while still in prison. Reforms should first start with the prison wardens. He said.POMAC vice chairperson Regina Saira said that during the 2014 United Nations (UN) periodic review, Kenya was encouraged to abolish the death penalty and in the process the views of the citizens had to be collected. This public debate seeks to get public opinion on offences which constitute capital crime, alternative punishment for capital crime, length of sentence and bring an open debate on death sentence. She said.She said that in Kenya there are over 3,000 convicts on death row and for the past 29 years no execution has been carried, the last one was that of Hezekiah Ochuka for the offence of treason.Sarina said that so far POMAC has collected views from 23 counties and after collecting views in all the 47 counties their findings will be documented and make appropriate recommendations to the president.
