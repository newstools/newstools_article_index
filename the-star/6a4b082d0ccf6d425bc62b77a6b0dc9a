Kenya is keen to provide an environment that allows the development of creative economies to promote culture, Deputy President William Ruto said yesterday.He said culture is an important aspect of ensuring the country, and the world, by extension, achieve sustainable development.&ldquo;We must mobilise the power and benefits of cultural and natural heritage. Creative industries can catalyse transformation across the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development,&rdquo; Ruto said.The DP was speaking in Paris, France, at the third Kenya Week, which is being held at the Unesco headquarters. Ruto said culture shapes social attitudes and determines the viability of policies, programmes and ideas.&ldquo;Culturally aware policy making is critical to success in quality education, sustainable urban development and greater sustainability. Culture also reinforces ownership of development policies and effectiveness in their implementation,&rdquo; the DP said.He said Kenya is keenly promoting a strong national ownership of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&ldquo;Our gathering here is the ultimate point of activities and celebrations that began at the county level. I am happy to note that some participants at the national celebrations are here with us, and I am confident they will help all of us to discover and rediscover Kenya&rsquo;s rich cultural heritage through the exhibition and cultural performances,&rdquo; Ruto said.He said Kenya recognises the role of culture in national stability, prosperity and the building of strong and successful communities.&ldquo;Our Constitution has clearly entrenched the cultural foundations of national viability in the national institutional and policy framework,&rdquo; Ruto said.
