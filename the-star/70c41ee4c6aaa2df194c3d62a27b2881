Whether he posted jokingly to show his heroism or whether it is the truth we must catch up with whoever he is," he said on Monday.Karuiki said the post has caused grievous damage and firm action under children's act will be applied to punish the culprit.One Twitter user said: "It's sickening..raping and bragging about it".Another said: "[This] is just another piece of hard evidence that mental illnesses are becoming a huge burden in this country.
