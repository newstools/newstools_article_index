Kenya Revenue Authority will partner with county governments to strengthen compliance in the remission of property taxes.Commission on Revenue Allocation chairman Micah Cheserem said although county revenues have grown to over Sh35 billion annually, counties are still highly dependent on the revenue share of the national government,"KRA has been talking about transforming into the Kenya Revenue Service [and] part of this transformation should be collaboration with county governments," he said on Wednesday.He was speaking during the 2nd Annual Tax Summit."KRA s mandate is not only to serve the national government by to also enable counties meet their own revenue targets," Cheserem said.Governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) and Joshua Irungu (Laikipia) said counties need additional support to automate their revenue collection and monitoring systems."It is noteworthy that KRA has assisted by developing a model, which has been adopted by some counties in order to harmonise revenue collection ... [but] for the model the be effective, counties need to harmonise legislation," Oparanya said.Irungu asked county governments to establish a legal framework to support revenue collection and automate fees and levies."In the case of Laikipia, the partnership with KRA has impacted positively on revenue collection. The county was exploring partnering with Kenha to install weighbridges as one way of addressing the damage on roads infrastructure," he said.According to CRA, property rates remain the greatest challenge in county revenue collection.The commission has observed that county governments have been issuing biannual amnesties to property owners to encourage them to comply with the law. KRA Commissioner for Domestic Taxes Benson Korongo said they are already working with some county governments to integrate the iTax System with county revenue collection systems and enable them generate billing slips through the system. Taxpayers will also be able to make payments and generate e-slips through iTax. Once fully implemented, other than boosting revenue collection for the counties, taxpayers will not be expected to visit county revenue offices for billing slips or to make payments for property rates. They will be able to carry out this task from their place of comfort using iTax system, Korongo said.
