Cord has no chance of winning the next election, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka yesterday said.Lusaka said the opposition has no chance of winning because Jubilee has a clear strategy against its rivals.Speaking in Bumula constituency, the governor said Cord will go the Jubilee way and have joint nominations to pick candidates.He said the move is similar to the merger of Jubilee affiliated parties into the Jubilee Party. The other side is trying to come up with joint nominations so they have a flag bearer to compete with us, Lusaka said.Cord plans to register an umbrella Cord Party but affiliates will not be required to merge.The governor said the Luhya community should be focused on how to get close to power before contesting for the presidency. Lusaka said in the March 4, 2013 general election, the community ran alone behind ANC chief Musalia Mudavadi and failed.He said they were left in the cold in 2013 but now have a chance to be in power by supporting JP. We have an opportunity of going to Canaan, not always being in the opposition, Lusaka said.He said no Luhya politician has the capacity to win the next elections unless they join forces with other regions.
