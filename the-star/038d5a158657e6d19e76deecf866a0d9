Even before the motion to impeach Governor Evans Kidero is debated, Nairobi MCAs have trained their guns on speaker Alex Magelo, who approved motion to sack the boss. A motion seeking his ouster is already on his desk for approval before tabling before the House.Fifty seven MCAs, 36 from Cord and 21 from Jubilee, have signed a petition by Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok (ODM), meeting the threshold to begin the impeachment. The assembly has been in turmoil after a motion to impeach Kidero was tabled. MCAs brawled last Thursday and on Tuesday. The laws requires at least one third or 43 of the 127 members sign the petition to initiate the process. The speaker has violated the Constitution by failing to protect the dignity, honour, respect and integrity of this assembly, Imwatok says in the motion. The speaker has and continues to degrade, malign the character and ability of the honourable members of this county assembly by, making malicious, contemptuous, vilification of members with divergent views and unfounded allegations against the rules and procedures of the assembly, reads the motion.If Magelo approves the motion, it could be tabled next week after which he will have a chance to defend himself against the allegations against him.If 75 per cent ( 85 members) of the 127 ward reps vote for the motion, then the speaker will have to leave office. The deputy speaker and members of the speaker s panel will take charge until another speaker is elected. Magelo was elected in 2013 by Cord MCAs who enjoyed a majority of one member. Of the 127 members, 64 were elected on the ODM and Wiper tickets and 63 on the Jubilee ticket. The majority scale has, however, tilted towards the Jubilee after Viwandani s Samuel Nyang wara and his South C s Diana Kapeen defected to Jubilee.
