Fifteen people have been arrested, more than 50 Chinese betting machines seized and 20 gaming premises closed down in a crackdown in Athi River subcounty. Deputy county commissioner Geoffrey Omoding yesterday said he directed all assistant county commissioners and chiefs to rein in betting machines. He said the game was encouraging laziness among the youth, leading to a bad culture of making money out of luck. We don t know the people behind this. All the counties have been invaded by these machines, Omoding said. He said the operation to eradicate illegal gambling was conducted in Katani, Syiokimau, Mlolongo, Athi River and Kinanie locations on Monday and Tuesday. He said culprits will be punished.
