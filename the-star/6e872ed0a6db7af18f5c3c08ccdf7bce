Chama Cha Mashinani will not be coerced into supporting Jubilee Party in the 2017 general election, leader Bomet governor Isaac Rutto has said.Rutto noted this on Tuesday when he received about 100 politicians who defected to the party.The Governor described the party as the only one that upholds devolution. He accused the Jubilee government of "killing" the process by employing delay tactics against the increase of county resources.Rutto said CCM was ready to field candidates to wrestle for the governor, senator, MP, woman representative and MCA seats in Jubilee strongholds all over the country.He spoke at a hotel in Kericho town after receiving the politicians drawn from Jubilee Party, ODM and Ford Kenya.Most of them were introduced as coming from Homa Bay, Turkana, Nyamira, Narok, Kericho, Bomet and Nakuru counties.Read: CCM party is here to stay says owner governor Isaac RuttoJohn Aule, an MP aspirant from Turkana South, said he was ready to run for the seat under CCM.He accused Deputy President William Ruto of attempting to "pocket" Turkana leaders by promising to give them direct JP nomination.Aule regretted that Turkana county still has children who go without food despite being rich in natural resources.The politician said that better health care, access to clean water for drinking and quality education have remained a mirage."Those elected are not concerned about the well-being of Turkana people. We recently discovered oil which is due for export, but nothing has been said by our leaders about how locals will benefit," he said.Wilson Kipeno, who will seek the Kilgoris MP seat on a CCM ticket, said he was best-placed to replace "absentee" MP Gideon Konchella."We last saw Konchella when he was campaigning for the Kilgoris seat in 2013. He has left the Maasai and Kipsigis communities poor," said Kipeno.Benard Odhiambo of Rusinga ward, Homa Bay county, dismissed the belief that one can only win a seat in Nyanza through ODM."I will contest on a CCM ticket. I am sure I will win through Governor Rutto's party," said Odhiambo.He added that democracy thrives Migori and Homa Bay counties since other parties have won seats despite its state as an ODM stronghold.Read: Rutto's CCM party to roll out nationwide recruitment in October
