Hopes of more than 100 youths in Msambweni, Kwale county who wanted to join the Kenya Defence Force were dashed on Tuesday following the condition of their skin.The group was turned away from Jomo Kenyatta primary school where they had sought to be listed for the army jobs following a contagious skin infection that affected their face, chest and back.Only five out of 184 youths, among them 21 girls and 163 boys, were allowed to proceed with other tests required for one to join KDF.Aisha Kanga, a public health officer, said that the infection is usually transmitted from one person to another through sharing of clothes.The group was automatically disqualified even before their academic credentials were checked.Kanga said the disease is treatable but can last more than 10 years if it is not medically attended to during its early stages.Lt Col Eric Oloo, senior recruitment officer covering Kwale, Mombasa and Kilifi counties, said that apart from the disease, some youths did not meet the required grades."Let the youths continue trying when such a drive is called for. We urge them to shun the temptation of joining militia groups," Oloo said.Read: 4,000 soldiers targeted as KDF kicks off recruitment on Monday Some of the rejected youths complained that the advertisement of the job did not clearly state the minimum grades required.Salim Mrenje, one of the youths, said that it would have been better if the advert specified the qualifications required for army, navy or airforce.Hussein Charo, a second year law student at Khartoum University, said that the recruitment was free and fair despite the fact that he was locked out."It is normal for the military to set high standards for those joining the force," he said.Five out of 300 were selected at Lunga Lunga sub-county on Monday; the recruitment was also conducted at Matuga.Read: KDF to recruit cadets, specialist officers
