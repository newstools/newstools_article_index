MPs have thrown their weight behind a Bill seeking to open founding President Jomo Kenyatta's mausoleum to the public and tourists.Debate on the Kenyatta Mausoleum Bill concluded yesterday during the second reading with MPs praising it as key to preserving the country's history and heritage.The Mausoleum, which is adjacent to Parliament Buildings and measures four acres, has been limited to visiting presidents and dignitaries laying wreaths.The sitting President also lays the wreath annually to mark Kenyatta's death anniversary.The bill proposes regulations, including charges to access mausoleum, be made by the Sports, Culture and Arts CS and be managed by National Museums of Kenya.The Bill, sponsored Chuka Igambang'ombe MP Muthomi Njuki, will see Kenyans and foreign tourists visit the Kenyatta Mausoleum at a fee.He said opening the mausoleum to the public will not only help to raise revenue, but will also serve as a national repository for the artifacts of the founding President crucial for both cultural and human interest."This will create jobs to Kenyans since the mausoleum will serve as a domestic and international tourist attraction. It will also serve as a place where research and dissemination of knowledge on the late President can be undertaken," Njuki said.In August, Shinyalu MP Silverse Anami said opening the mausoleum to the public will help boost Kenya s cultural identity.
