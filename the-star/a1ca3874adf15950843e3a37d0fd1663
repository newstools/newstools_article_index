Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti (pictured) has said he has forgiven Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire after she apologised for their public spat a week ago. She said the devil made her do it. He said the MP has realised she was misled by a few people who advised her to disrupt his event . We should politick maturely, not organise gangs to disrupt meetings. I am happy she has apologised, he said.
