We are also focusing on wastewater management where the little clean water that comes in is used for drinking while the recycled water is used for other purposes like car washing and watering flower lawns, said the CS.He was speaking during a consultative meeting with the media and Nairobi MPs at the Nofolk hotel.Projections by the Athi Water Services Board indicate that Nairobi County s water supply capacity will surpass demand by the year 2020 where supply will hit 820,000 cubic meters per day against a daily demand of approximately 700,000 cubic meters.The data indicated that this will be against the backdrop of an expected population growth from 3.8 million recorded in 2015 to 4.4 million by 2020.Speaking during the event, Athi water services board CEO Malaquen Milgo said that the various projects aimed at expanding water and sanitation services will be funded by donors and development partners such as World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), KFW development bank and Africa Development Bank.Milgo said the board is currently undertaking the fourth Nairobi water supply programme that will see a 25 per cent increase in water supply to the city from 550,000 to 690,000 per day.He said the projects which include the construction of independent community production plants along the pipeline routes, the expansion of the Kiamaiko, Gigiri and Kabete pipelines carrying capacity and the development of 70 new boreholes has already been completed.
