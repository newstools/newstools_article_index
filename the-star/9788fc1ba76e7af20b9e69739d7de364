Murang a Governor Mwangi Wairia indefinitely suspended two transport officials on Tuesday evening for delaying implementation of road projects.Transport executive Amos Njoroge and chief officer Simon Thuku were suspended over the Sh1 billion feeder roads rehabilitation programme the Governor launched two months ago.Wairia said they delayed the murraming of the roads that have been graded, without giving good reasons. He said phase two of the project was to begin three weeks ago. These officers are being paid huge salaries to work for the people but they are the ones delaying development projects, he said.The Governor said only roads in 15 of the 35 wards have been murramed, yet money to upgrade all feeder roads was set aside in the budget.The county graded more than 5,000km of roads and 350 more are expected to be rehabilitated before the rains begin.Wairia said lax county employees and those who fail to deliver will be sacked and replaced with hardworking people. We only have one year left to concentrate on service delivery before the next general election. We cannot afford to waste time, he said.The Governor is said to have put members of his cabinet on notice for non-performance.He told those not committed to delivering their duties effectively to resign.Wairia earlier raised concerns over tardiness by some employees, saying it was "a way of stealing from the public". I am not willing to work with people who drag my government behind by failing to appropriately provide services to residents, he said.Read: I forgive rivals for fighting my projects, says Governor WairiaAlso read: Wairia likely to face Jamleck, Ahadi boss and young trader
