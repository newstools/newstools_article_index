Coco the Alaskan Malamute might be the most pampered pooch in the world.The pet dog has apparently been given eight iPhone 7 handsets by his doted owner, the only son of China's richest man Wang Jianlin, worth 23 billion, according to Chinese media.Pictures have emerged on China's social media showing the lucky canine posing next to a stack of eight boxes believed to contain a 800 phone in each.Coco's eccentric owner Wang Sicong, 28, was educated at Winchester College and is already worth 430 million.These pictures were believed to be uploaded by Wang Sicong to the dog's very own social media account on Weibo, which has nearly 1.9 million followers and is ironically named 'Wang Keke is a bitch'.The images were posted in the afternoon of September 16, the first day the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus went on sale.Along with the pictures, a post read: "Not sure what people are showing off on Moments (a Chinese social media platform)! There is nothing to show off. I was forced to take action."The pictures have been widely shared by Chinese media, including news sites cnbeta.com and on.cc.The post has also gathered thousands of shares and comments.Some people said the dog was cute while others hoped Wang Sicong could give them a free iPhone 7 too.One Weibo user named 'M mi jia' said: "[The dog] is so cute."While another user called 'wo shi lao duan zi' said: "Does the dog plan to host a lucky draw?'Some people were envious of the dog's fortune, such as 'Free liu te' who said: 'Coco is richer than me!"'Zha lao ban' wasn't impressed as the user commented: "I can't even live as well as a dog."In China, an iPhone 7 costs 6,988 yuan ( 803) while an iPhone 7 Plus costs 7,988 yuan ( 918).Sicong is a successful businessman and one of the richest entrepreneurs under the age 30 in China. As the pet of Wang Sicong, Coco has somehow become a celebrity in her own right in China as her owner calls her: "The dog princess of the people."Through her Weibo account, Sicong shows off the ostentatious lifestyle he has created for his dog with luxury products most animals can only dream of. This is not the first time Coco has impressed the public with her cutting-edge gadgets.In May 2015, the pooch was pictured wearing not one, but two 800 Apple Watches given to her by her generous owner. The pet was also given a pink Fendi handbag by his owner in the same month.
