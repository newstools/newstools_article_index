Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said ODM is working with Musalia Mudavadi s Amani National Congress.Oparanya, the ODM deputy party leader, said ANC is more serious than Ford Kenya.The governor said Mudavadi should back Cord leader Raila Odinga s presidential bid.Oparanya urged Mudavadi to use the next general elections to prepare for 2022. Negotiations are ongoing and we hope to come together officially soon, he said.Oparanya spoke at Magale polytechnic in Shinyalu constituency on Thursday.The former Deputy Prime Minister hinted on Sunday during a two-day tour of the Coast that he has been in talks with Cord to form a super alliance that will defeat JP. Mudavadi said, I am ready to work with people who are ready to serve Kenyans. Right now, I am not having any talks with Cord until they put their house in order. Mudavadi has not ruled out working with Cord.Oparanya said if given the two options, he would vote for Mudavadi, not Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang ula.He said Wetang ula is not a serious presidential candidate as he only campaigns in Kakamega and Bungoma counties. If a Luhya wants to be President, we must work closely with other communities, he said.Oparanya said Luhya leaders who joined the Jubilee Party will lose their seats in the elections.He said the leaders are unable to sell Jubilee in the region because the regime ignored Western development because the region voted for the opposition in 2013.Jubilee has been making inroads in Western ahead of next year s election.
