We have heard of many complaints targeting traffic and NTSA officers and the only way that this can be resolved is working as a team, he said.The director added that corruption among procurement officers was also high, with many of them amassing wealth through shoddy deals. We have also seen some government officers taking bribes to issue ID cards and this poses a major security threat to the country, he said.Mubea was speaking during the Leadership and Integrity workshop for members of Kitui County Assembly held at Lake Naivasha Country Club.He praised the county for becoming the first to gazette and sign its code of conduct, noting that this would go a long way in addressing cases of corruption. The Commission will offer technical support to the Kitui County assembly in enacting the code of conduct and we challenge other counties to follow suit, he said.Also read: EACC needs Sh5.6 billion in the next financial year - Kinisu
