MPs yesterday adopted the ratification of the Economic Partnership Agreement, shielding the country from heavy taxes on exports to the European Union.Lawmakers had been recalled for a special sitting yesterday to adopt the treaty, which will help persuade the EU not to impose taxes on Kenya s exports from next month. The ratification means Kenya is committed to the agreement, thus averting negative ramifications for the economy that pose threats to jobs in the agricultural sector. We are doing this as part of our obligation to the East African Community and the citizens we represent. We are not in any way jeopardising Kenya s commitment to the EAC, majority leader Aden Duale said, seconding the motion.However, Muhoroni MP James Koyoo opposed the motion, saying it could open floodgates for unscrupulous businessmen to flood the local market with cheap goods, creating trade imbalances.
