The Kenya Private Sector Alliance will urge members to sign a binding code of ethics to stamp out graft, it says.The 400-member organisation has been on the spot for failing to rein in members accused of sponsoring lucrative trips for MPs as incentives to pass certain legislation in their favour.Members have also been accused of being beneficiaries of lucrative government tenders, some of them highly inflated, at the expense of taxpayers.Kepsa chief executive Carole Kariuki said the association will subject members to a universal code of ethics which bars them from engaging in immoral activities such as bribery.Companies that irregularly lobby for favourable regulations should be punished as individual entities and should not be seen to represent the association, she said.The anti-bribery bill aimed at punishing private sector players more than before is an indication of efforts to deal with graft in the sector, Kariuki said.Participants at the National Assembly Speaker s round table talks held in Mombasa at the weekend said Kepsa is doing little to fight graft.
