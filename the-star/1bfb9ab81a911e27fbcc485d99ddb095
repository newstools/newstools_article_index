Attempts to impeach Governor Evans Kidero have hit a dead end.This is after Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang wara, who initiated the move and sponsored the impeachment motion, withdrew last week. This means Kidero can now breathe easy and concentrate on service delivery.Nyang wara on Friday wrote to speaker Alex ole Magelo, withdrawing the motion. He had tabled the motion on October 4. I wish to withdraw a notice of motion filed pursuant to Section 33 of the County Government Act, 2012 and Standing Order 60, reads the letter.The speaker suspended the debate on the motion on Wednesday, following a court order obtained by the city boss on Monday, barring the county assembly from doing so.The High Court order also prohibited the assembly from summoning the governor to defend himself against the accusations in the motion.Magelo had on October 5 summoned Kidero to appear before the MCAs to defend himself.On Saturday, the office of the clerk said Nyang wara can only withdraw the motion on the floor of the House, after the case filed by the governor is heard and determined or if the county executive withdraws it.Nyang wara was unavailable for comment as his phone was switched off.Last Tuesday, the session to debate the motion was adjourned after the assembly failed to raise a quorum of 43 members.All the Cord and more than 20 Jubilee MCAs boycotted the sitting.The assembly has been in turmoil since the motion to impeach the governor was tabled.MCAs brawled on September 29, when Nyang wara attempted to table the motion. The motion was finally tabled on September 4, in a stormy session.Nyang wara had accused Kidero of incompetence, lack of leadership and violating procurement laws.
