Don t panic over the nominations, residents will decide who will be their MP, a Webuye West aspirant has told incumbent Dan Wanyama. Kennedy Wanjala, popularly known as Mkombozi, will run against Wanyama for the Jubilee Party ticket.Wanjala accused Wanyama of going round in funerals, harambees and church services, announcing that he is the only bona fide JP candidate. Voters should not be intimidated by anyone. There will be free and fair nominations and only the voters will decide whom they want, he said.Wanjala spoke to the Star on Thursday last week in Webuye town. He was a URP member and will probably also face Nzoia Sugar chairman Joash Wamangoli at the nominations. I urge voters not to repeat the mistake they made last time of electing someone who has discriminated against some wards in terms of development and CDF disbursement, he said. The seat has attracted six aspirants Nzoia Sugar IT manager Arnold Ndukuyu, businessmen Jonathan Kane and Peter Sitati, lawyer Steve Biko, Wanjala, Wamangoli and Wanyama.But Wanyama said CDF cash has always been distributed fairly. He said if that was not so, residents would have complained.
