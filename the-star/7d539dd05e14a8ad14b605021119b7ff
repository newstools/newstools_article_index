The National Cohesion and Integration Commission have surveyed ethnic representation in employment in constitutional commissions, the state corporations and the county governments.The results of this important survey are interesting. The Judicial Service Commission is the only one of 15 surveyed by the NCIC that has contravened Section 7(2) of the NCI Act byhiring more than a third of its workforce from the same ethnic community.The NCIC found the most diverse institution in terms of fair recruitment on the basis of tribe is the Kenya Ports Authority. The KPA has recruited staff from 34 ethnic groups. The Kenya Forest Service, the Kenya Airports Authority and the Kenya Revenue Authority follow, with staff from 30 diverse communities.In the counties, 68 per cent of the devolved governments were found to have more than 70 per cent of their staff from one ethnic group.The KPA is to be commended for its inclusive, face-of-Kenya hiring policies. They should be emulated.
