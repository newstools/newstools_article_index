Auditor General Edward Ouko yesterday said he will release a corruption report for the 47 counties where he says graft is rampant.Ouko said a good percentage of the Sh300 billion set aside for the 47 counties to individually run county activities ended up in individuals pockets.He spoke at the launch of the Parliamentary Initiatives Network guide to audit reports at a Nairobi hotel.PIN has been developing A Guide to Understanding National and County Audit Reports to help individuals and organisations understand key audit issues. Ouko said corruption is immense at the national and county governments, which has significantly compromised services. The office of the AG requires more resources to audit all financial statements and prepare reports. We also have to ensure we have verified the information we gathered, he said.The auditor added, Unfortunately we have a small team and also minimal resources, hence, the process has remained slow. We urge everyone to monitor public assets as well as government expenditure. If everyone plays their role, we will save a lot and Kenyans will have the best services, he said.The Auditor General was reluctant to give a summary overview of the report. He urged the EACC, parliamentary committees and the police to fight corruption. Ouko said resources at the county and national levels require close monitoring.
