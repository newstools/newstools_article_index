A university student yesterday was sentenced to 20 years in jail after a court found him guilty of committing unnatural acts with three children in Makongeni.Principal magistrate Eveline Olwande sentenced Ray Thomas Ochieng to 20 years in jail for each count of sodomy to run concurrently. The boys aged between seven and nine were attacked on September 6, 2008. Prosecution counsel Shirley Chepkonga told the court two brothers and a friend were playing outside their houses when Ochieng called them into his house. He gave them cakes before defiling them. We were scared to tell our parents as Ochieng had threatened to harm us if we reveal the incident, one child told court. Chepkonga said the children identified the accused. In mitigation, Ochieng said on that day he had exams and spent his day at the university library. He, however, failed to show anything to prove he had exams.
