The government wants the pilots union to call off a planned strike at flag carrier Kenya Airways due to start on October 18.Transport CS James Macharia said on Thursday that Kalpa overstepped its mandate and that the strike will cause widespread economic and national disruption."The government will use all the levers available under law to take action against those who defy this directive," he warned in a statement.Macharia further said the association did not follow due process in issuing the notice."Whilst a strike is a constitutional right, on this particular strike notice, Kalpa overstepped its statutory mandate as a union, which is to negotiate and only engage in matters relating to collective bargaining agreements between its membership and KQ," he said.Kalpa issued a seven-day strike notice for an overhaul of the Kenya Airways management team, following yet another case of a flight delay. A Kenya Airways flight from Lusaka was delayed by technical hitches on Tuesday morning.Paul Gichinga, secretary general of the Kenya Airline Pilots Association, said they will down their tools from 5am next Tuesday.He said they will take this action if Kenya Airways chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze and chairman Dennis Awori will not have left office.More on this: Pilots issue seven-day strike notice after another KQ flight delayBut Macharia said only the airline's board and shareholders can determine the exit of the CEO or board chairman.The Cabinet Secretary further noted that the national carrier is in a fragile state of recovery."With regards to management and board changes, the public and stakeholders may not be aware that the members of the board and senior management are between 4 to about 24 months old in their positions," he said."While it is easy to demand management changes, stakeholders need to understand that in any business as complex as KQ's hurried and emotionally-driven actions can be counterproductive."Macharia said the last time pilots went on strike to demand management changes, they caused the airline to lose up to Sh200 million a day. He said they also caused travelers severe inconveniences and monetary loss."....Not to mention the negative impact on the broader economy in terms of cancelled businesses, investment and other travel-related events and decisions," he continued."The government takes extremely seriously any actions from any quarter that have disruptive and damaging impact on the normal functioning of the country."Macharia further noted that the pilots neither sought negotiation nor mediation.He said the conclusion is therefore that Kalpa is not interested in helping KQ but in personal gain.The CS said the association should refrain from taking on oversight roles but engage shareholders in providing useful input, like any other stakeholder would.The airline threatened to stop selling tickets on its network if Kalpa does not retract its strike notice."Kenya Airways will have to immediately stop selling tickets given the costs associated with selling tickets and not carrying these passengers," the national carrier said in a statement on Thursday.The airline said industrial action by Kalpa is "unjustified and uncalled for".Read more: KQ threatens to stop selling tickets over 'unjustified' Kalpa strike noticeAlso read: Kenya Airways explains flight delays, says problems solved
