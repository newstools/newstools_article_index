Kenyans in the Mt Kenya region should stop blaming former President Daniel arap Moi for the collapse of cooperatives in the 1990s, cooperative leaders in Nyandarua said on Saturday.Speaking at Ol kalou during International Day Of Cooperatives celebrations, Tower sacco treasurer John Gitundu said cooperatives collapsed because of the liberalisation of the economy. He said cooperative leaders took advantage of relaxed government control to misuse public property."I never saw Moi come to my sacco to demand that we should not save, invest or safeguard members savings. Many cooperative societies, particularly in the coffee sector in Nyeri, Kiambu and Murang a were robbed by greedy leaders, Gitundu said
