If you let your standards fall, you will have failed your students and your country," he said.Uhuru asked those in charge of new universities to guard against tribalism and to uphold national values."Our universities have a special role to play in nation building: they challenge our parochial concerns, expose us to Kenyans of different origins and experiences; and teach us the value of our nationhood," he said. "They cannot do that if they are held back by nepotism and tribalism."The President also witnessed the installation of chancellors of the new universities as part of the elaborate ceremony of the award of charters. The chancellors included Fred Ojiambo (Kirinyaga), Joseph Nyaga (Cooperative), Mohamed Elmi (Rongo) and Sally Kosgei (Taita Taveta).Others were James Mworia (Machakos), Musili Wambua (Embu), Philista Onyango and Peter Njiiri (KAG East).
