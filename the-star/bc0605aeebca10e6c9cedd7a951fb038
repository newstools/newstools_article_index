The Mweiga Sasini Estate has launched a mega biogas project to generate 150kw of power.Managing director Moses Kiplagat said the Sh60 million project will increase profits, which will reflect in the shareholders accounts.He said the energy will be produced from cow dung of more than 300 cows.It will be used in processing milk, lighting up an upcoming estate in the farm and pumping water to irrigate grass and coffee fields."This plant is a big relief to us, because we can now run our activities without the fears of paying high electricity bills every month," Kiplagat said.The MD spoke when he launched the project on Saturday.
