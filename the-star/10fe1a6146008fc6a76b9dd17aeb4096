Local and international journalists have lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for assenting into law the Access to Information Bill.They say the Act puts to rest the long debated issue of government departments withholding information they viewed as 'secrets' from the public.Speaking at a conference in Nairobi on Friday, the journalists said the Act also gives effect to article 35 of the constitution.Transparency International said the Act places an obligation on public agencies to explain their actions, policies or decisions to citizens if they seek explanation. The Access to Information Act proposes to cover public bodies or information held by another person and required for the exercise or protection of any right or fundamental freedom, TI said.Sandra Musoga of Article 19 and Simon Nzioka from the Ombudsman's office said the new law also benefits individuals seeking information from public bodies in government.Nzioka said the law guarantees individuals the same privileges as corporate entities when seeking information.Request information is submitted in writing, either in English or Kiswahili. In the event that the applicant is unable to read and/or write, or has a disability, the applicant is allowed to make oral requests.The Act also applies to private entities that receive public resources and benefits, utilise publis funds, engage in public functions, provide public services or have exclusive contracts to exploit natural resources.But Musoga expressed concern that some existing laws may continue to restrict information access.They are the Official Secrets Act, Chapter 187; the Evidence Act, Chapter 80; and the Preservation of Public Security Act, Chapter 57.The four-day conference, which began on Tuesday, was aimed at training participants on access to information as a journalistic tool.In attendance are journalists drawn from Kenya and Norway, mostly handling issues on land and human rights. The conference was organised by Article 19 and supported by NORSK Pressforbund in collabotation with Norwegian Press Association.
