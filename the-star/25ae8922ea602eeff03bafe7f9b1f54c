The creators of the most-watched drama series, The Good Wife, bring us a new political satire show, but, interestingly, with a science fiction twist. BrainDead centres around Laurel Healy, who works for her brother Luke, a US senator. Laurel discovers that there is an alien bug invasion in Washington. The bugs enter the victims through their ears and control their minds. Yes, perhaps the alien-bug-mind-controlling plot is a little far-fetched, but somehow, the show conveys a charming alternative side with its brilliant female protagonist and the recent political shenanigans. Star Rating: 3 out of 5
