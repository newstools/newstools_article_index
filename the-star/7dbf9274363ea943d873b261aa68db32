Kisumu county chief officer of finance Kephas Kasera has reported threats to his life by a section of contractors over non-payment.Kasera said he received information onSeptember 16 that some eight contractors sought the services of a criminal gang within the county to eliminate him.He said the contractors told the militia group that he had refused to pay them hence wanted him dead."I got information from one member of the gang who was in a meeting with the contractors held within the town," he said.The official added that the group declined the offer saying they could not execute the operation without the authority of their leader.Kasera said that on September 19, the contractors met with the gangsters again where they gave a down payment of Sh100,000 promising the same amount after the job was done."When the militia group leader was back, the group demanded Sh1 million from the contractors for the job knowing in mind they could not afford the money. The contractors said they would consult and get back to the group," he said.Read: County debts cripple services Kasera recorded a statement on September 20at Kisumu Central Police Station.On Friday, he told the Star that the payment has delayed because the county had just started its Financial Year.He said pending debts accrued from the last Financial Year have slowed down payments of the same.The official said that they are in the process of crafting a supplement budget that will factor in all the debts so that the contractors are paid."I want to assure people that they will be sorted out once we are done with the supplementary budget process," Kasera said.This comes as the county assembly Finance committee was tasked to investigate why contractors and service providers have not been paid.Read: Kisumu hoteliers demand Sh100 million owed by county governments In a statement to the assembly, East Seme MCA Aggrey Ogosi on Thursday last week demanded explanation over the delayed payments.
