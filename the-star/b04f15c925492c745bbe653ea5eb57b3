South C ward representative Diana Kapeen has refuted reports she has defected from ODM to Jubilee Party."I have not decamped from the party though I don't think it is the party I will use in 2017. In fact, I don't think I will run for any position next year," she said.Kapeen also denied claims she is one of the MCAs behind plans to impeach Governor Evans Kidero."I cannot impeach Kidero. He is my personal friend. I campaigned and voted for him in 2013," she said.Kapeen blamed individuals in the county assembly of trying to push her out of the party that she had been a member of for 10 years. She asked party leader Raila Odinga to change the assembly party leader.Kapeen and her Viwandani counterpart Sam Nyang'wara are said to have dumped ODM for Jubilee.
