Lugari MP Ayub Savula has asked the Jubilee administration to treat Western region as part of Kenya .He said projects the government promised to implement in the region have not started nine months to the next general election. The only development projects in Western were done through the CDF, Savula said.He asked the government to expedite the Sh6 billion revival of the collapsed Pan Paper Mills in Webuye, to create jobs and steady the region s economy. Savula said residents feel the roads the government promised for the region may not materialise, since the elections are around the corner.He spoke at Webuye Motel, when he met elders and delegates from the Tachoni community on Saturday.Savula said the three presidential hopefuls, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Cyrus Jirongo (UDP) and Moses Wetang ula of Ford Kenya should agree on who among them should run for the top seat. This will guarantee the community power or give it a chance to negotiate with the winner in case of loss at the polls, he said. If they fail to agree, we the upcoming leaders will takeover in 2022 and present a fresh candidate from the region, considering their age. Savula said the amount allocated to the CDF is too little to fulfil all the development needs.He said MPs will initiate amendment of the Constitution to entrench the CDF in the supreme law and avoid conflicts between legislators and the executive over control of the fund. We want the money to be channelled through a structured system like the former district development committees, where MPs are members, the MP said.
