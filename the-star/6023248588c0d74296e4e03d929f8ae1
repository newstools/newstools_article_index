He passed on as I arrived at the hospital, he told the Star on the phone.Musyoki said Oduwole has been sickly since March. He has been in and out of hospital. He has been to The Mater Hospital, Nairobi Hospital and even London, but this morning God decided he should rest, he said.Musyoki said Oduwole s death is a big blow to the Ndeti family, as he held a big place in their lives and in their hearts. He was not just an in-law but a son of the family. He was very supportive of the family, he said.Musyoki described Oduwole as a humble man who had respect for all, whether young or old.
