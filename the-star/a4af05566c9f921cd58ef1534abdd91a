Kieni MP Kanini Kega (pictured) has urged security officers to investigate if Thursday s Mandera attack was carried out by al Shabaab or a local militia. He said the attackers could be criminals disguised as militants of the Somalia-based terror group.Six people were killed when al Shabaab terrorists hurled grenades and fired randomly at a residential building that housed 33 non-locals in Mandera town. In Somalia al Shabaab kill indiscriminately. But in Northeastern, we are told they separate natives and non-locals. Police could be rushing to blame al Shabaab while it is a criminal group purporting to be al Shabaab, Kega said.He spoke on Saturday after condoling with the family of David Munene, 40, who was among the slain six. Munene worked as a lorry driver. Kega said security should not be devolved as the governors may use police officers to harass their political rivals.
