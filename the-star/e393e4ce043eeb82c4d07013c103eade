Ogiek elders have denied the government consulted them on plans to remove a caveat on the Mau Forest.They said the caveat will remain in place until the government holds talks with them to find a lasting solution. The elders spoke during a meeting in Nessuit, Njoro. For the past 20 years, the state has never been ready for talks. We went to court to ensure justice prevails. Where have they been? Why give directives without any dialogue? Joseph Miringa, a resident at Logoman, Eastern Mau, said.The community was reacting to Deputy President William Ruto s remarks on Friday that the government will lift the caveat.
