The disarmament campaign has helped reform owners of illegal firearms and some have been recruited as reservists by the National Police Service. Most of those providing security to workers of the company building the Isiolo-Moyale road are police reservists recruited to serve their own people, deputy director James Ngului said. People have confidence in them because they are doing a commendable job. They are trusted by the local community as they are known to them. Most of the illegal weapons recovered by the Kenya Focal Point on Small and Light Weapons were from the arid and semi-arid counties, Ngului said.He said 90 per cent of the weapons were recovered from pastoral communities in Wajir, Isiolo, Mandera, Turkana and Samburu.Ngului said the weapons are used in cattle rustling and for protection. He said the rest of the weapons were recovered from urban areas, where they were used in crime. Ngului said the weapons were recovered through amnesty, voluntary surrender and confiscation.He said KNFP donated 400 motorcycles to owners of illegal guns who voluntarily surrendered them to the state. Others received financial aid to set up shops and start agribusiness.
