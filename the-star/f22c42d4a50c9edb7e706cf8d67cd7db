The family of the Malindi doctor arrested last week for alleged links with ISIS have denied allegations he engages in terror activities. Alin Abdiqan, 35, a doctor at the Malindi Subcounty Hospital, was arrested at 2am on Thursday last week. The family said 40 heavily armed security officers, including four FBI agents, raided their home and terrorised them in the dead of night. Abdiqan lived in his mother-in-law s six-bedroom house opposite the hospital s mortuary. Kilifi county acting police commander Matawa Muchangi said he had been on the run since August, when two interns at the hospital were arrested over alleged links with a terrorist group. But family members on Friday said he has been present all along and on Thursday came home from work at 10.30pm. His wife Mumina Fazini said the officers broke down doors and the kitchen windows. We appeal to the government, even if they suspect someone, they should not destroy property, she said.
