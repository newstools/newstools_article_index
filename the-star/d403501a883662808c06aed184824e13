Two people have been shot dead in the Kerio Valley as persistent clashes between the Pokot and Marakwet communities intensify. They were killed on Thursday in a fierce gun-battle in Kaben, Marakwet East subcounty in Elgeyo Marakwet county. Area police boss Emmanuel Rono said one Marakwet man and a Pokot were killed in the fight. Rono said an unknown number of Pokot attackers invaded Kaben village and killed a middle aged man.He said the Marakwet youths retaliated after the killing, shooting dead the Pokot. We have enhanced patrols in the area. We are expecting additional officers to manage the situation, Rono said. The attack, which has heightened tension in the Valley, occurred less than 24 hours after a joint peace meeting in Baringo East on Wednesday .The elders were tasked with calming youths in their areas.Unlike recent banditry attacks, Rono said no animals were stolen during the Thursday attack, leading to confusion over the motive of the attack.
