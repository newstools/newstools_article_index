A property bubble has burst in Kisumu and is seen as the only way that the housing shortage in the lakeside town will end.Despite skyrocketing prices of land in the region, more property developers are going against the gravy train and are already positioning themselves to earn from the growth.This is evident in the surge of mega housing units, shopping malls, hotel establishments and high end gated communities that now straddle the expanding city.From areas such as Kajulu hills, Mamboleo, Migosi, Lolwe as well as Nyamasaria, the growth prospects have only got better by day.This is envisioned to be setting the region in the path that low investments that it has grappled with will not be anything to reckon anymore.Thanks to devolved system of governance, a market exists that the upcoming homes, hotels and malls will readily serve.With the Kisumu International Airport, an expanded thoroughfare and barely no traffic jams on the city's roads, the town has more to celebrate on its added value.The construction of the Kondele bypass roads and the expansion of the Kisumu-Kericho and Kisumu-Busia highways have seen the city open up.Developers have shifted focus towards housing units, commercial, retail space and apartments to tap demand from lifestyle-driven businesses that serve a growing class with disposable incomes.Western Emporium Ltd s managing director Ramesh Mehta says most of the retailers are looking to operate their businesses round the clock.Middle income homes is the new thing of the town. Le Rosey Apartments and Victoria Gardens Estate are the latest housing units in the lakeside city.Victoria Gardens Estate is situated at the foothills of Riat Hills next to newly built mega Lake Basin Mall while Le Rosey is edging its rivals that once shaped the skyline of Mamboleo.Imran Jaffer, director of Le Rosey, says the apartment is comprised of 32 housing units including a two and three bed roomed housed.According to Jaffer, the emergence of affordable houses is a boost in promoting Western tourism circuit.The fully posh furnished units are being sold at Sh7.5million each. He said Le Rosey offers amenities such as solar water heaters, backup generator Borehole and a-24 hour security.The apartments also has electric fence, ample parking spaces, granite counter tops, open plan and elevator accessJaffer said with rapid growth seen within the last six years in the lake side city of Kisumu, the robust middle class is yearning for housing, shopping and places to go.Traditionally, the Milimani, area in Kisumu has been the premier area to live and spend time, but with the saturation in the area, and the demand in the market, there has been a shift meets the threshold for what consumers want. This has pushed growth very rapidly to areas such as Migosi where we have seen over 2,000 residential units pop up out of nowhere which has resulted heavy crowding in these areas, with no drainage, insufficient water supply and lack of parking or roads, he said. As this is positive growth for the city of Kisumu, we need to standardize and set benchmarks for developments, to plan longer sustainable infrastructure in the area, he adds.Mamboleo is situated about 3.5km from the Kisumu s Central Business District and about 3km from united mall that houses Tuskys supermarket, the lake basin mall will help push the property value in the Mamboleo area.Housing developments in Mamboleo are starting to attract investors and first time home buyers, with the proximity to premier shopping area of lake basin mall and having the northern bypass at its foot.And Le Rosey apartments, is already edging out other ventures with its affordable luxury, from spacious interiors to well planned amenities and excellent finishes.Developers are also taking advantage of the aesthetic breath taking views of Lake Victoria and Nandi hills are definitely worth it.The National Housing Corporation is also working on standardizing and setting new benchmarks in the town.Eric Ounga, Victoria Estates Commercial Partner and director Ounga Commercial Agencies, says that the newly unveiled estate will be the new Runda in Kisumu city. Many developers are now eying Kisumu with others keen on residential units. Others are interested in setting up malls targeting shop businesses and banks, he said.Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma and his Siaya counterpart said at a recent event that they want real estate developments that rival those in Nairobi and Mombasa. We want more residential units, malls and hotels within the county to help boost our economy as well as provide employment opportunities, Ranguma said.He said presence of supermarkets such as Uchumi, Nivas, Tumaini, Ukwala, Khetias, and Maisha Mart only show that the region is position itself for the best.Simba Corporation, which owns the Villa Rosa Kempinski in Nairobi, is among those that are angling for these opportunities as evident in its majestic 4-star Acacia Premier hotel.This has increased competition for established hotels such as Imperial, The Vic, Sovereign, Eco-Lodge, Le-Savanna and recent entrant Imperial Hotel Express established.Imperial Hotel Express, located on Oginga Odinga Street put up by Mayfair Holdings at Sh400 million has brought the British express model to Kisumu as well.It has 55 rooms that charge as low as Sh5, 000 or say $50 dollar for bed and breakfast without fringes that result to additional costs on the client.In 2015, former Kenyatta International Convention Centre managing director Fred Simiyu said funds have been allocated to build a large capacity conference facility.Ounga said a high demand for residential units has created investment opportunities.A three-bedroom mainsonette in Milimani estate, he said, is costing about more than Sh9 million from Sh2.8 million six years ago. The cheapest apartments in Kisumu range from Sh4.5 million and above depending on the residential area, Ounga said.
