Mombasa MCAs found pieces of cotton wool in five bottles of Dasani water on Tuesday afternoon, spelling trouble for the Coca Cola Company.County assembly Health committee chair Kibwana Swaleh said they would not have noticed had they been drinking the water at night. We noticed since it was daytime. It is scary when you think of how many people have already consumed such water, said Swaleh.He said Coca Cola will be given a chance to explain, but noted this was the second such incident.Swaleh said they handed the bottles to the Public Service Health Board for investigations and analysis.He said tough measures will be taken against the company if a report proves that the water was contaminated.But Coca Cola CEO Ibrahim El Khoury said their water was clean and had been cleared for human consumption by the Kenya Bureau of Standards.He said they have deployed their groundsmen to the county assembly to collect the bottles.The company will also investigate the supplier and seize stock before forwarding it to its laboratory for analysis. We have taken up the matter and we will give out our findings when we receive the report from our officers, Khoury said.
