ODM leaders in Kwale have dismissed insinuations that the region is fully supporting the ruling Jubilee coalition.They said the mere fact that Governor Salim Mvurya ditched ODM for the President Uhuru Kenyatta camp does not mean the region is now pro-Jubilee.Benjamin Tayari, an MP aspirant who is among organisers of a two-day tour by ODM leader Raila Odinga, said the region will back the latter until he wins the presidency. "Kwale county cannot back Jubilee just because of one person. The region is among those which have been marginalised by the past and current government. The only solutions to our issues is helping ODM taking over leadership," he said.He said they will back Raila since he is best-placed to deal with historical injustices meted on residents by past regimes."The Jubilee government cannot be trusted to solve issues of Kwale people because they have not done anything so far," he added.Read: Kwale muslim leaders to back Governor Mvurya's 2017 bid Tayari said that he will oust the Jubilee MP Gonzi Rai (Kinango) as the legislator has failed his constituents."People have faith in me and Cord.
