Kiplagat, a man loved and feared in equal measureFor 24 years, former Athletics Kenya president Isaiah Kiplagat wielded his power at Riadha House raising the then colourless federation into be what it became a global power house.He took over Athletics Kenya, then known as the Kenya Amateur Athletics Association from Paul Boit in 1992 after ascending from the post of secretary general.Many consider him to have built the Athletics Kenya administration through dictatorial leadership. He acquired authoritative powers as he went along.While some were opposed to his feudal lord-like leadership style, he was hated and loved in equal measure.During his tenure Kiplagat saw Kenya top the world during the World championships in Beijing last year to enter the history books with a glorious performance of 7 gold, 6 silver and 3 bronze medals.That marked the height of his success at Riadha House. He would announce his retirement soon afterwards but that was a decision he rescinded until he was later suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations.His suspension alongside that of his deputy David Okeyo and former treasurer Joseph Kinyua was necessitated by anti-doping process subversion and bribery claims.He was elected unopposed as AK chief five times despite the storm mounted by his critics who included branch chairmen.The calls for his resignation intensified in 2013 with AK branch chairmen from 14 affiliates out of the 16 demanding a change at Riadha House last year. They called for a special general meeting.Their agenda was to discuss the irregular appointments and the AK constitution which they alleged was altered to suit the incumbent.Last year Kiplagat appointed Lt.General (RTD) Jackson Tuwei as acting president in order to leave him free to concentrate on his campaign for the IAAF vice presidency which he lost.Immediately after the Beijing championships last year, he returned but his plan to disband AK s executive failed after Professional Athletes Association of Kenya staged a siege at Riadha House.Yesterday former marathoner Moses Tanui, a known Kiplagat critic sent a message of condolence at Kiplagat s passing saying though they differed in opinion, Kiplagat is the man who made AK stand.
