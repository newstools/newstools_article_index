Despite the limitation of team size at the instigation of the International Paralympic Committee, the Kenya paralympians who jetted out to Rio de Janeiro less than two weeks ago clearly made every chosen team member count.As a result Kenyans can now bask in the glory of having won three gold medals, a silver and two bronze medals. That was good enough for fifth place in Africa behind Nigeria with eight gold, two silver and two bronze; South Africa with 7, 6, 4, Algeria 4, 5, 7 and Egypt 3, 5, 5. When looked at in context, this was a fantastic performance by the Kenyans because they were among the smallest contingents at the Games. The fact that some of the Kenyan competitors suffered disqualification only emphasises the medal haul could have been even more impressive.This showing should underscore the importance of not overlooking the disabled in our midst - because the athletes have continued to prove that disability is certainly not inability.
