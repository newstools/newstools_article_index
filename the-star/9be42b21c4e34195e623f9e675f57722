Head of Serious Crime Unit John Kariuki has been summoned to court to tell which officer is handling a hate speech case involving four Cord politicians. Magistrate Martha Mutuku yesterday issued the summons after defense counsel James Orengo complained that it is difficult to tell who the investigating officer is. The court needs a sense of direction, Orengo said. Mutuku also directed the state to supply the defence with the evidence they need within the next seven days. The matter will be mentioned on September 1 to confirm compliance and for Kariuki to explain the state of affairs.The case against MPs Aisha Jumwa (Kilifi), Florence Mutua (Busia), Timothy Bosire (Kitutu Masaba) and Junet Mohamed (Suna East) was to proceed for hearing yesterday but failed owing to the absence of documentary evidence. Orengo said the state did not comply with orders directing the evidence be produced.
