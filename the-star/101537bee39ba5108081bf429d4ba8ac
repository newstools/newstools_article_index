An interfaith group is preaching peace in prisons and counselling inmates to help them be peaceful and law-abiding once they are released. They want ex-prisoners to be accepted by the community. The group also promotes unity among communities to prevent violence, especially during elections. The 42 Plus Women for Peace group comprises one woman representing each tribe in Kenya.On Wednesday, the group visited Kiambu Prison, cooked for the inmates and interacted with them. Chairperson Janette Njeri said ethnic barriers must be broken to promote peace. To promote unity we must penetrate every corner of the country, and prisons too, she said. Group chairman John Mwaniki, a victim of the 2007-08 post-election violence, said the initiative will prevent another PEV. I am a witness of what ethnic enmity can do to the country... That is why we took this initiative in reaching out to brothers and sister in prisons to spread the love of unity and the need to live in harmony as Kenyans, he said.
