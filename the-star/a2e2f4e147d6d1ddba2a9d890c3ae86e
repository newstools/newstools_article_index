WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has had his Internet access cut off by the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has been living since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual assault.WikiLeaks has alleged that US Secretary of State John Kerry has been pressuring Ecuador to shut down Assange's Internet access in order to impede publication of documents about Hillary Clinton during the US Presidential campaign.The move by the Ecuadorean Embassy follows WikiLeaks' publication on Saturday of hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which contain the transcripts of speeches made by Clinton at Goldman Sachs events.WikiLeaks said in a Tweet: "We can confirm Ecuador cut off Assange's Internet access Saturday, 5pm GMT, shortly after publication of Clinton's Goldman Sachs speeches."
