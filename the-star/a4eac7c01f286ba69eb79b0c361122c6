Four men were remanded for three days by a Mombasa court on Tuesday for further investigations into their suspected links to ISIS.Chief magistrate Julius Nang'ea ordered Ali Musa, Mwinyi Musa, Khamisi Hakim and Yasin Ahmed detained following a request by police.The court heard that the three were planning to carry out terrorist attacks at unspecified areas in Mombasa and Kwale counties.Police had asked for 14 days, saying the probe will include analysing mobile phones seized during a raid at their house on October 7 when they were arrested."I believe the respondents are involved with the offences or may have information which may assist in the investigations," the prosecutor said.The court further heard that the investigation involves a number of government agencies and that the suspects were likely to contact their accomplices who are still at large."With the upsurge in terror-related cases in the country in the recent past, the allegations against the respondents are grave and need to be thoroughly investigated," the prosecutor added.The case will be mentioned on October 14.Read: Wife of ISIS terror suspect detained 14 daysAlso read: Is the threat of a biological terror attack by Isis in Kenya real or mere posturing?
