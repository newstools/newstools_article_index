Uncertainty surrounds the Kenya Sevens technical bench with the contracts of head coach Benjamin Ayimba and his staff expiring at the end d of this week with the union having advertised the positions two weeks ago.Speaking after leading Kenya to Safari Sevens win victory over Samurai 38-21on Sunday, Ayimba said he is delighted with the new talent that has emerged and hopes they will be given a chance to play at the World Sevens circuit. We do have the talent in this country to compete with the best teams in the world and players like Brian Tanga, Aluda Beda, Steve Sikuta, Lameck Dunde and Ginton Adongo all impressing over the weekend, added Ayimba.Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Richard Omwela said he hopes to have the technical bench in place by the first or second week of October. I believe we have adequate time for the team to start training for the world series and also get their strength, conditioning and preparation for the series, added Omwela.Elsewhere, Homeboyz half-back Michael Wanjala has been ruled out for the next three weeks after suffering a hand injury at the Safari Sevens tournament over the weekend.Wanjala, who captained the Kenya Morans in the two Africa Cup Sevens tournament, will miss the Impala floodlight tournament which kickoffs this weekend at the Impala Club. Wanjala will, however, be available for the opening Kenya Cup fixtures on October 22 against former champions Nakuru RFC at the Jamhuri Park showground. Homeboyz face champions KCB in the Impala floodlight quarter-final match.Homeboyz coach Simon Odongo said Wanjala s injury gives an opportunity to another player to step in and do the club proud. We will of course miss his experience but it s a chance for other young players to showcase what they have. The 15 s season is a hectic one coming from the Sevens circuit. We want to start on a high and KCB will be a good test for us, added Odongo.
