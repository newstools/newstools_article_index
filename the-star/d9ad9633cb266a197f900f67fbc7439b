Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday said his desire to be Kenya s fifth President is not cast in stone.He said he is willing to support whoever is chosen as Cord s flagbearer. But if he is chosen, he expects their support.Kalonzo, speaking on Radio Jambo, said he will support ODM leader Raila Odinga or Ford Kenya s Moses Wetang ula if either is nominated. We cannot speak in absolute terms that Kalonzo has to be on the ballot. But if Kalonzo is the solution to deal with Jubilee s incompetence, then we can also explore that route, he said. Cord has shown clearly that we are together. These are the last moments for Jubilee. People should not be worried because we will stick together and nobody will tear us apart, he said. Cord leaders have been divided over who should face President Uhuru Kenyatta. Three weeks ago, Wetang ula was accused by ODM MPs of insulting Raila while addressing supporters in Narok. He likened Raila to a barren cow , referring to his three failed attempts to be President. Wetang ula urged Raila to support Kalonzo or himself. He has not apologised, despite clamour by Raila s supporters that he do so.Kalonzo accused Jubilee of massive corruption, tribalism and high unemployment, among other things. He said consensus should be used in nominations, but said he will not rule out other approaches. As a coalition, we do not have time to organise delegates. The moment you do that, you create an atmosphere of animosity. We know our strengths and weaknesses as Cord principals, he told the Star in a separate interview. However, Kalonzo urged Raila and Wetang ula to reciprocate and support him, should he be nominated. We must be clear in our thinking. I am ready to sacrifice even 20 times, but we need to know that there must be reciprocity. One good turn deserves another, he said.
