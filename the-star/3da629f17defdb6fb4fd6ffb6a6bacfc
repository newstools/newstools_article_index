Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has agreed to pay sacked environment executive Evans Ondieki Sh8.8 million for unlawful dismissal.In an agreement dated August 22, that was entered on his behalf by lawyer Tom Ojienda, Kidero said he would comply with the court's order for the compensation.Ondieki's award of unpaid salaries, gratuity and costs of the suit was issued on August 5 by the Employment and Labour Relations court.This was when Justice Nduma Nderi quashed Kidero's decision to remove Ondieki from office saying it was not done in a transparent manner.Nderi said the Governor was unreasonable in sacking the county official on the basis that he attended a church service alongside former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru."The court orders compensation to the applicant equivalent to full gross salary, less taxation, for the unserved term of contract between him and the county government," the judge stated.But he did not see the need to direct the county to rehire Ondieki since he did not want to be reinstated.Read: High Court orders Governor Kidero not to sack OndiekiOn January 26, days after reshuffling his government, Kidero appointed Urban Renewals and Housing CEC Tom Odongo to replace Ondieki in acting capacity.The Governor said the decision was aimed at ensuring efficient service delivery to Nairobi residents.Ondieki sued Kidero and the county government saying his removal from the post was not only arbitrary but also contrary to the law.He told the court that his sacking was instigated by malice and political whims, and further claimed he was fired for supporting Waiguru and Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru.The Nairobi government has 30 days to compute the award and file it for consideration by the court.Read: Court orders Kidero to compensate Ondieki for illegal dismissal
