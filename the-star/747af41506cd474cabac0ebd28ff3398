The Working Group on the Socioeconomic Audit of the 2010 Constitution established by a resolution of Parliament in 2014 has tabled its report before Parliament s Budget Committee.We wholeheartedly support the group s conclusion that Kenyans are over-represented and its recommendations that the number of MPs and MCAs positions be reduced and salaries and allowances drastically reduced.Our MPs are so over-paid that they earn more than British legislators, who make the equivalent of KSh750,000 monthly and enjoy no sitting allowances.The county governments should be allocated more resources for development, but something drastically deterrent needs to be done to combat the devolution of corruption.The recommendation that both levels of government (national and county) undertake value-for-money analyses of all projects funded by the taxpayer has the potential to fight the corruption cartels.The Working Group is headed by Auditor General David Ouko, who knows the anatomy of graft at both levels of government intimately. Capping the costs of representative government will be essential for devolution s success.
