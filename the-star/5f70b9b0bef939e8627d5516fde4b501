Changamwe MP hopeful Peterson Mitau has told National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale to stop meddling in the constituency s politics.He accused Duale of trying to impose Abdi Daib on residents. The people of Changamwe are not fools. They know who has been with them and they know who has served them, Mitau said on Wednesday. On Sunday, Duale led a group of Jubilee leaders in a rally to endorse Daib. Three camps within the Somali community in Mombasa are fighting for the Changamwe seat. Some people support Mitau (Wiper), others are behind Daib, and another group wants Hajir Maow of ODM elected.Former Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim is expected in Mombasa next week to campaign for Maow. Maalim wants to unseat Duale from his Garissa Township seat.
