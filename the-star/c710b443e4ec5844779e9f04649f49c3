Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter (pictured) yesterday said he is confident of being re-elected and warned those eyeing his position against quitting their jobs. He said his rivals have no chance of unseating him because he has performed well. The people of Nandi will give me a second term, Keter said. Last Sunday, Keter hosted DP Ruto in his constituency, signalling improved relations between them. I ll run on the JP ticket, he said.
