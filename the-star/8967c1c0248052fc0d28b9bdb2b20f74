Former Kiambaa MP Stanley Githunguri has sued the National Land Commission over a disputed multimillion-shilling property in Kiambu county. In a suit filed on Friday at the Milimani law courts, Githunguri accuses the commission of dispossessing him of the prime property by revoking his title deed without following due process.Through the law firm of Munga Kibanga, the politician claims NLC, in a decision communicated to him on August 15, took away his ownership right of Tassia Coffee Estate without giving him an opportunity to defend the land. I first learnt on 17 November 2015 through the media of a notice published by the NLC purporting to review the grant over title no Nairobi block /97/1736 by the commission. On August 15, I learnt that NLC had revoked the title, Githunguri says in an affidavit. He says the decision violates his rights and the rules of natural justice, and accuses NLC of bias.
