Chase Bank (in receivership) has partnered with Edulink International College to provide students with an easy fee payment platform. The two organisations have signed a Memorandum of Understanding in a deal which makes Chase the banking partner for Edulink. The college, which enables local students to acquire UK degrees from The University of Northampton, will give students or guardians who will bank with Chase a 20 per cent discount for the duration of the course. Chase Bank is keen to continue partnering with education institutions to give opportunities to the institution, the parents, guardians and students through tailor-made banking services and convenient access to payment options, Chase Bank receiver manager Paul Russo said. The partnership is part of a strategy to increase access to quality education.
