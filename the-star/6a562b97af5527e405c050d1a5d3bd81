Meru governor Peter Munya has finally honoured summons to appear before the senate's Public Accounts and Investments Committee.The defiant Council of Governors chairman had snubbed the committee chaired by Kisumu senator Anyang' Nyong'o.He is expected to appear before the team on Tuesday morning to be questioned on audit queries raised in the 2013/14 financial year.Two weeks ago, the committee summoned Munya to appear before it after failing to present himself to respond to audit queries.In a press statement on Monday, CoG said Munya will present himself for probe by the Nyong'o team."Munya shall appear before the senate Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday. The governor shall be honouring summons extended to him by the committee," the brief statement said.
