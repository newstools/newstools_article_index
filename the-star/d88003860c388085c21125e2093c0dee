Senior county officials forged documents to defraud the Nairobi government of more than Sh17.9 million through shady procurement deals, a court heard last Friday.Geoclean Enterprise director Charles Irungu testified in a case in which suspended chief Finance officer Jimmy Kiamba and county secretary Lilian Ndegwa are charged with three other senior former county officials - Stephen Osire, Regina Rotich and Nancy Kiruri - with misappropriation. They are accused of irregularly obtaining Sh17.9 million between November 2013 and December 2014.Irungu presented documents allegedly forged by them. The documents included a certificate of registration for his business, letter heads and voucher receipts, cheques and his signatures to obtain Sh650,00 from the county. He said he dealt with county officials who gave him contracts without him preparing quotations. Chief magistrate Kennedy Bidali heard the case. Irungu said he once fitted vertical blinders and was paid Sh115,000 in cash in Kiamba s office. Rotich asked me to deliver the blinders which I did and was given Sh115,500 in cash, he said.The witness named several top officials at City Hall who gave him jobs without any quotations and paid cash without giving them a kick back. The defence, through lawyer Paul Nyachoti, dismissed Irungu s claims and accused him of being part of a cartel that aims to bring confusion .
