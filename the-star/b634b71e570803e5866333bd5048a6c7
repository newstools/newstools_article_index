Juja MP Francis Waititu has urged Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery to take stern action against politicians making inciting the public.He cited Cord leader Raila Odinga, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria.Munyua reprimanded Sonko over the remarks he made at the funeral of former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti's husband on October 14. Sonko said he was the acting President.Waititu said the senator s remarks were seditious and disrespectful to the presidency. Sonko must take full responsibility for his words. He has to tell Kenyans which Constitution says e is or should be an acting president when the head of state is out of the country. That was treason and he should understand that he is just a senator, he said.Waititu was addressing the press after a meeting with pastors at Pefa Church in Juja on Monday. He said Sonko s remarks aimed to anger certain people.Waititu criticised Raila's remarks that Cord supporters should forcibly eject IEBC commissioners from office. He said the remarks aimed to raise political temperatures and cause chaos. Raila is a grandfather like me and I d expect him to be wise and use wise words while addressing Kenyans. He knows his status in the country and is aware that any inciting remarks would result to chaos. He should not be spared by the law," Waititu said.Munyua said Nkaissery should not spare Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, who called Raila s supporters cows. They are using inciting language so they can go on another fish eating spree to iron out their issues. We are tired of this and Kenyans want them taken to court and jailed if found guilty, he said.
