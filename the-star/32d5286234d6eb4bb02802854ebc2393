Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth has been accused of fooling Kenyans through the media that he had tarmacked roads in the entire constituency.Area MP Humphrey Njuguna on Monday said that Kenneth became famous following the alleged development record, yet there is nothing to show for the same on the ground.Njuguna said that Gatanga is yet to meet its development needs, with most locals lacking clean water for domestic use, while most roads are still in deplorable condition.Read: Gatanga is not number one constituency - MP The MP said at Mianyani Primary School in the lower Gatanga, when commissioning renovation of classrooms, that most areas in the constituency do not have even an inch of tarmac.He listed Ngalelya, Ithanga and Kakuzi-Mitubiri as among those areas whose infrastructure was claimed to have been improved."I was laughed at in parliament when I asked for roads. Some of my colleagues told me to let other constituencies get their share since all roads in Gatanga are tarmacked," Njuguna said.The MP said that he has fought for roads in the area of which the government has agreed to tarmac close to 200 kilometers within the constituency.Njuguna said he will petition Roads CS James Macharia over incomplete roads in the region, adding that residents have "suffered enough just because one person lied that roads in the area were in a good state and the issue hyped by some media outlets".Kenneth said he could not speak at the time he was contacted for comment.Meanwhile, Njuguna said that acute water shortages experienced in Gatanga will come to an end once three projects being executed in the area by the national government are complete.He said that the ongoing construction of the Gatanga Water Supply Scheme, the Northern Collector Tunnel at Kigoro/Kanunga and the Ithanga Water project will be helpful to the residents."These projects, once completed will save residents from the agony of going without clean water for years. It is a historical injustice that we own Ndakaini dam as our natural resource but we don t benefit from it," Njuguna said.The MP also said that Athi Water Services Board is undertaking feasibility studies for the proposed Nyaga Samuru Water Project which aims at improving water supply to Samuru division at an estimated cost of Sh460 million.The MP however urged residents to be vigilant and weigh which politicians they elect to various offices.
