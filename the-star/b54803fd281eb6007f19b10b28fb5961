Former champions Kenya Prisons women s team will be seeking to complete a double against rivals Kenya Pipeline when the final leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation national league takes centre stage next week in Eldama Ravine.The side coached by KVF technical director David Lung aho beat the reigning champions Pipeline 3-0 (25-22,25-21,25-20) in the first leg in Homa Bay County in July.The wardresses who last won the league title in 2013 have been impressive this season, winning all their fixtures and are placed first on the log unbeaten with 21 points from seven matches.Kenya Pipeline on other hand are second with 18 points from seven matches.The resurgence for Prisons has been attributed to the presence of sensational setter Jane Wacu, middle blocker and former national team captain Brackcidise Agala, hard hitting Evelyne Makuto and national team captain Mercy Moim.Wacu, Agala and Makuto rejoined the team after their attachment contract with French side Charmalieres ran out. Moim s attachment with club Orpo in Finland also lapsed.However, it remains to be seen if they will cap a win in regular season before the play-offs in November in Mombasa. They were stretched to a five set thriller 3-2 (21-25,25-19,22-25,25-10 and 13) by Pipeline before they reigned supreme during the Taita Taveta County Government Cup last Month in Voi.Wacu is on record saying it will be humbling if they reclaim the title they last won in 2013.
