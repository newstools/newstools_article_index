The government has not fulfilled the promises it made to the people of the Western region, nine months to the general elections. Lugari MP Ayub Savula asked the government to expedite the promised Sh6 billion revival of collapsed Pan Paper mills in Webuye.He said the government promised to revive the company to create jobs and steady the region s economy. The only developments that have taken place in Western were done through the CDF which is a fund shared to all the 290 constituencies, he said.Savula spoke at Webuye Motel when he met elders and delegates from the Tachoni community on Saturday.He said that the amount of allocation of CDF to constituencies was too little to fulfill the development needs. We want the money to be channeled through a structured system like the former district development committees where MPs are members, he said.Read: Settle on formula for picking flag bearer, remove old faces, Savula tells CordAlso read: We will not leave Jubilee, you led us there, Western MPs tell Mudavadi
