At least 20 Migori MCAs have accused Governor Okoth Obado of refusing to allocate bursaries in their wards after they criticised his government.The MCAs, who numbered half of elected members of the county assembly, said their wards were yet to receive bursaries allocated in the current financial year.They said this was the case as they have called for the completion of development projects and for non-performing officials to be sent home.The county assembly passed Sh120 million for bursary in the last financial year.The MCAs addressed journalists at county assembly grounds on Thursday, led by Richard Solo (North Kamagambo).They included Jared Osawa (South Sakwa), Robert Bondori (Muhuru Bay), Joshua Ongoma (East Kamagambo) and Paul Mang ondi (Got Kachola).The ward representatives said beneficiaries last received bursaries in first term.They said Obado should scrap off the financial aid if he does not want to offer it. On behalf of our colleagues who are yet to get bursary, we are telling Migori county to scrap it off because poor students are suffering," said Solo. It is pathetic that only children from politically correct sections in Migori are getting bursary. The rest are left in a limbo."Osawa said: We have sat down with Obado over the issue but have received negative replies from county officials. We believe the ploy is deliberate."Bondori said it was unfortunate for the Governor to waste resources and play politics at the expense of needy children.Nicholas Anyuor, press director in Obado's office, said the county government was looking into the matter.
