Average interest rates on government securities continued to fall marginally this week, creating more room for banks to lend to the private sector where returns are capped at 14 per cent.Average yield on the 182-day Treasury Bills fell to 10.42 per cent during the auction on Wednesday, while 364-day paper dropped to 10.42 per cent from 10.60 per cent the previous week.The sale of 182-day paper was oversubscribed by 44.67 per cent with bids amounting to Sh8.68 billion against the Sh6 billion on offer, the Central Bank said yesterday. The CBK, however, accepted Sh5.31 billion, turning away Sh3.37 billion.Bids worth Sh7.33 billion for the one-year debt securities were nonetheless all accepted despite being oversubscribed by 22.17 per cent, an indication that the CBK sees the rate oscillating around these levels in the next one year. The weighted average rate of accepted bids, which will be applied for non-competitive bids, was 10.416 per cent for the 182-day and 10.417 per cent for 364-day Treasury Bills, the CBK said in a statement.The auction is dominated by commercial banks which are reeling from interest controls regime which has thinned margins. The Banking (Amendment) Act 2016, which came into force on September 14, caps interest on loans at four percentage points above the 10 per cent Central Bank Rate ( 14 per cent). The amended law further requires banks to pay a minimum interest of 70 per cent of the CBR on term deposits. Once the law was signed some bankers tried to move their assets to government securities, CBK governor Patrick Njoroge said on September 21. However, this is not an open door because there is also a supply constraint driven by the government borrowing programme. Analysts at Britam Asset Managers projected that government securities will continue to be attractive to investors in the nearterm until the yield fall below the inflation rate at 6.26 per cent in August. I don't think there will be room to earn negative real return. So most likely investors will trade towards the middle single digit, Elizabeth Irungu, the fund management firm's chief investment officer, said.
