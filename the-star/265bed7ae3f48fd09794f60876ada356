An Egyptian company with interest in sports, telecommunications, real estate and industrial projects has set up a sports camp in Nairobi's Runda as it gears to develop major sports facilities at Home Africa's Migaa and Karen. The government is going to ensure that all the necessary infrastructure is in place to make Egypt s operations in Kenya smooth. Our plan is to provide a peaceful working environment so that these projects can be a success, President Uhuru Kenyatta said last Thursday when he hosted a delegation of Wadi Degla Group at State House. Kenya s economic ties with Egypt have come a long way, and this is the time we became closer.
