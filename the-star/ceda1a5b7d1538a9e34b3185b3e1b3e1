Disgraced Bongo singer Ray C was in June this year taken back to rehab after she relapsed following her prolonged battle with drug abuse.Ray C real name, Rehema Chelamila was introduced to the drug world by her former lover and rapper Lord Eyes, back in 2012, something she has come to regret ever since.The once celebrated songstress became so addicted she resorted to selling off her belongings to sustain her bad habit, leading to bankruptcy and eventually putting an end to her singing career. Back in June, an emotional video of Ray C emerged online, showing her attempting to commit suicide in public using a knife but thankfully police rescued her on time and the singer was arrested.The clip shows Ray C being escorted away in a police van after the unsuccessful attempted suicide with the artist visibly seen in a trance claiming that she was being kidnapped and harassed. This was the lowest point that Ray C had ever sunk to after declaring she was clean.With her health deteriorating the talented singer came out to reveal to the world that she was a drug addict, and appealed for help, which saw former Tanzanian President, Jakaya Kikwete came to her rescue and offer to help her by ordering her to be taken to rehab.Well, after the suicide attempt, Ray C was later taken back to a rehab centre - Rehab, Life and Hope Rehabilitation Centre in Bagamoyo, Dar es salaam - and from the looks of things, she seems to be recovering well and has even come back to social media.The journey to recovery and staying clean for the Uko Wapi hitmaker has not been easy, and with time, she has come to discover that self-love and acceptance are the start to staying healthy.She recently shared a long post about her decision to love herself first and not judge her addiction, seeking God's help too. Check it out below."Just as we don't have the right to judge someone else,we don't have the right to judge ourselves.Our addictive script in the past was that when we did something we felt ashamed of,we judged ourselves guilty.All too often,we then punished ourselves.Was that behaviour an expression of our shame and sadness because we are addicts?Punishing ourselves won't stop the problem but Loving ourselves will.We are grateful that our recovery has taught us the difference btn guilt and shame.Guilt let's us feel remorse and sadness when our actions violate our values.Guilt helps us know when we've acted badly;to ourselves through making amends;shame leaves us hopeless.To give in to shame and self-hatred only harms us and intensifies the power of the problem.There is a better way,and that's to learn to love OURSELVES.GOD PLEASE STEP IN WHEN I FEEL THE URGE TO TAKE THINGS OUT ON MYSELF,May your love for me teach me to love myself instead.AM LEARNING TO LOVE MYSELF AND AM LOVING IT."
