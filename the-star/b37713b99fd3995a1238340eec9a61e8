President Uhuru Kenyatta will this morning preside over the swearing in of Chief Justice designate David Maraga.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale yesterday told the House the President will also witness the swearing in the nine members of the IEBC selection panel.MPs last evening sat late-beyond the normal 6.30pm to adopt a report by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee.The House had until last midnight to approve the CJ being the expiry of 14 days after Maraga's name was forwarded by the President.The Committee which held a public hearing for Maraga's suitability, had recommended that the House approves the 66-year-old as the country's second Chief Justice under the 2010 Constitution after Willy Mutunga who retired.The Samuel Chepkonga led committee threw out three petitions which had challenged Maraga's appointment as baseless and lacking merit.In the report, the committee said Maraga had the requisite qualifications and vast experience which qualifies him for appointment to the position of CJ."The candidate exhibited impressive knowledge of topical issues including demonstrating understanding of administration and management principles required to address the challenges facing the judiciary," the report reads in part.The lauded Maraga for exhibiting a proper understanding of the doctrine of separation in which the executive, parliament and Judiciary respect the principle of separation of powers and appreciates checks and balances."According to the records and information availed to the committee, Maraga has never been implicated in any issues that may lead to a conclusion of lack of integrity on his part, " the report says.The committee observed that it threw out the petition and objection by Samson Ndenderu, because it lacked merit as Maraga obtained stay orders on behalf of his client and that the CJ designate owed no duty of care to the petition who was the plaintful.The petition by residents of Ainamoi constituency lacked merit because Maraga properly exercised his lawful judicial discretion to reduce the charge of murder against an accused from murder to manslaughter, the committee observed.The committee said a petition by Edward Onyancha was also properly dismissed because he was found to have filed an appeal out of time.
