Talk of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho standing as Raila Odinga s running mate was a gimmick that threatened to wreak havoc within Cord. Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar said the talk was reckless, myopic and childish, vexed and offended opposition loyalists .He said the ODM deputy party leader rants without considering others feelings. We are focusing on bringing change in 2017 but with your shisha stimulation, you have started traversing the entire country, Omar said.During ODM s 10th anniversary celebrations in Kisumu, several party legislators proposed that Joho should be Raila s running mate. But last week Joho said he will not be running mate. He said he will campaign for Raila s election as President next year then run for the top seat himself in 2022.Omar, Wiper s secretary general, said Raila put a leash on the governor s neck to keep him in check and that s why Joho dropped his bid to be running mate. He spoke on Saturday during a public lecture at the Renaissance Centre where Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua was the chief guest. When contacted for comment, Joho, through his aide Richard Chacha, said he refuses to be dragged into Omar s ploy . Omar said Joho should not venture into national politics because he s only county league material. He cannot compete at that stage. Here at the county we have overrun him, he said.Omar said it will be a major blow if one of the Cord co-principals bolts because of Joho s reckless talk . Everyone in Cord plays a crucial role. If Kalonzo moves out, about 1.7 million votes will be lost, he said. He said Cord has focused on unity. We agreed that each party should popularise itself to form a strong coalition, Omar said.
