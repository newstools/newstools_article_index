A rebel ODM MP has complained that they are still sending Sh20,000 monthly contributions to the party.Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama told the Star on Monday that this showed the party led by Raila Odinga was not being genuine.Arama accused Raila of dictatorship, said his 10-year old party lacked democracy and noted it was threatening to kick rebels out. If they were true to their word, why are they still receiving our money? If they were genuine they should have stopped, he said. We have been reading in the media about letters we have received from the party s disciplinary committee. We have not received any and we treat that as mere propaganda."The MP refuted claims they were paid to join Jubilee. Why should some people claim I received Sh5 million to join Jubilee? That s my two-month salary, he said.Thirteen ODM rebels dared the party to expel them after ODM threatened to deregister them for defecting to President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party.The leaders said last Wednesday that they have not been served with notices to show cause why they should not be deregistered.Through their lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, the leaders said they are constitutionally entitled to freedom of association and to make political choices.More on this: ODM rebels dare party to expel them, deny receiving warning lettersNotable among Western leaders who defected from ODM was Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba, who accused Raila of frustrating him.Ababu quit his party secretary general post on July 4 and later relaunched Labouor Party of Kenya through which he will defend his seat at the August 8, 2017 general election.He criticised MPs John Waluke (Sirisia) and Paul Otuoma (Funyula) as "cowards" for skipping his much-hyped event.It had been said the three were behind the 'mulembe consciousness' movement aimed at uniting Western residents and securing their place in politics.[AUDIO] Ababu resigns as ODM secretary general, narrates Raila Odinga's betrayal
