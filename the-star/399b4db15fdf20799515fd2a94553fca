The UK government-owned CDC Group has closed acquisition deals with two Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firms, targeting returns from growth of SMEs and infrastructure development. The development finance firm has bought 10.68 per cent stake in I&amp;M Holdings for undisclosed amount and 40 per cent stake in ARM Cement for Sh14.1 billion, the two companies announced yesterday. The deal with I&amp;M was agreed on April 19 while that for ARM Kenya's second largest cement maker was inked 10 days later on April 29. I&amp;M Holdings is pleased to inform its shareholders and the investing public that all the conditions precedent to completion of the acquisition of the sale shares have been fulfilled, and the acquisition of the sale shares was completed on 30 September 2016, the banking group, founded in 1974 said, in a notice yesterday. The fund is targeting returns from loan deals to cash-strapped small and medium-sized enterprises in the five-nation East African Community bloc. It has a combined wealth of about $145 billion, with its investment in I&amp;M. The banking group has presence in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Mauritius. The growth of many businesses is constrained by a shortage of affordable finance. Through its partnership with IMHL, CDC will promote access to finance, particularly to SMEs, which are important contributors to economic growth in the region, the fund said in a statement on April 19. CDC is hoping to reap big from heavy public investment in infrastructure projects in the region through its stake in ARM Cement, which has operations in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. The company is pleased to notify its shareholders and the general public that the conditions set out under the investment agreement have been satisfied by the company or waived by the CDCAC, and the company has further sought and obtained the necessary the necessary regulatory approvals, ARM said in a statement yesterday.
