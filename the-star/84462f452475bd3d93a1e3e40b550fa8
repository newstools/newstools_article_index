Deputy President William Ruto has accused Lamu leaders of using misinformed propaganda to sway the public s support for major development projects. He said they scare away investors. Ruto told residents the Sh200 billion coal plant and Sh21 billion wind power project will change Lamu s economy as well as the entire country. He spoke on Tuesday during the last day of his Lamu tour of Mpeketoni. Ruto told county leaders to first establish the facts about projects before rejecting them. We don t want people opposing development projects that they have no knowledge of. These projects are meant to change the lives of our people and I think leaders must have the interests of the people at heart," he said. The coal and wind plants are expected to generate 1,050MW and 90MW of power. The coal plant will be built by the Amu Power Company, while the wind project will be put up by Kenwind Holdings Company. Ruto said the extra power will be used on the Lamu Port Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport project. There is need to ensure the power-generation capacity is increased ... we shall also have in place industrial parks, resort cities, the standard gauge railway and others. All these require adequate power production and supply, said Ruto.
