Laikipia Queens women s team will feature in the next year s Kenya Volleyball Federation national league.Speaking over the weekend during the Baringo County Open tournament in Eldama Ravine, team manager Alfred Ruto said all the logistics are in place ahead of the next season. We wanted to have a feel of what to expect when we debut in the league next year and that s why we featured in Baringo Open. We are aware it s going to be a tall order but having started the preparation early, we hope to make an impact, said Ruto.He added, KVF have been reaching out to counties to invest in sports and I am happy this team has been sponsored by a well wisher from Laikipia County Mohamed Deddy and therefore we remain indebted for the good gesture from him. We are currently recruiting players to beef up the squad ahead of the season. Ruto, who doubles up as the Kenya Defence Force men s volleyball team manager, also regretted their absence in the next month s KVF play-offs for first time in a decade.KDF, who have been regulars in the play-offs fell by the wayside last Friday as they succumbed to Kenya Ports Authority 3-1 (25-18,24-26,25-22,25-19) hence failed to book the sole ticket that was up for grabs. Ruto said they may be down but not out. He said: Of course it s saddening, but we can t kill ourselves. We intend to go on a signing spree so that we have a strong side come next season in a bid to reclaim our position in the play-offs and go all the way to challenge for the 2017 title. He added, I wish the qualified teams in the play-offs all the best as all this is geared towards improving men s volleyball and the sport at large. The men s team which have qualified for the play-offs include surprise package Nairobi Water, champions General Service Unit, Kenya Prisons and KPA.The women s category has Kenya Prisons , champions Kenya Pipeline, Nairobi Water and Kenya Commercial Bank.
