Two Kwale MCAs one for and the other against Governor Salim Mvurya confronted each other on social media on Saturday.They disagreed over the formation of an ad hoc committee to investigate public officers campaigning before resigning. Mvurya s ally and Kasemeni MCA Anthony Yama said there are more important issues that need to be addressed including the passing of critical bills other than investigating county workers. In a Facebook post he said, Wasting time drawing allowances for probing people amounts to insincerity and failure on our part. Mwereni MCA Kassim Pojjo took on Yama saying his statement was misleading because he was not in the house when the issue was raised.
