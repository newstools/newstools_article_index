An advocacy group has questioned the formula used by the Commission on Revenue Allocation to distribute equalisation funds to counties.The group - International Budget Partnership says CRA's distribution formula may disadvantage areas with slightly higher incomes that lack access to basic infrastructure and services.The equalisation fund is anchored in the constitution and targets marginalised areas where access to health facilities, water, roads, and electricity is limited.In a report A Fair Share of the Budget: Principles and Practices in Public Resource Distribution in Kenya IBP researchers said CRA s approach to measuring infrastructure is also questionable.IBP country director Jason Lakin said the concern is that the road access variable is calculated based on the percentage of roads tarmacked in a county. This seems to ignore the fact that a county s need for roads will differ according to its size and population density. The percentage of roads tarmacked is also a poor measure of need since a county may have all roads tarmacked, but have very few roads to begin with, he said.The equalisation fund has more than Sh20 billion since 2011-12 financial year because the money was not disbursed in year 2015-16 fiscal year.IBP further says the education and health sector indicators used by the CRA do not provide a valid measure for a marginalisation index in counties since they consider service measures and not facility access.Latin said a proper distribution formula should look at needs, not just in terms of access, but also in cost of delivery adding this is why many revenue-sharing formulas, including CRA s own formula for the equitable share include land area . Counties with larger land areas have a higher cost of service delivery due to more expensive logistics. Likewise, if the cost of health, education, or infrastructure are different, giving them the same weight may be unfair, he said.
