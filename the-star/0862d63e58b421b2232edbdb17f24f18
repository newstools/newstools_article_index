Taveta MP Naomi Shaban (pictured) has urged residents to join the Jubilee Party to reap the fruits of being in government. She is the only MP from Taita Taveta elected on the Jubilee ticket in 2013. People in the villages, who never dreamt of having electricity in their houses, are now lighting their homes thanks to our government, Shaban said in Taveta on Thursday last week.
