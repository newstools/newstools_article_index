Embu Lands executive Josphat Kithumbu has said the issuance of title deeds for a decade s long disputed Mwea Settlement Scheme will go on despite a court order barring it.Kithumbu (pictured) told the Star on the phone that the Kirinyaga government has obtained an ex parte order restraining it from issuing 7,232 title deeds to residents who have not had land for more than 10 years.He said Kirinyaga is claiming ownership to the land on which the scheme is located. The land has already been distributed to the residents. It wants the issuance of deeds stopped until the case is heard and determined.Kithumbu said the case on the boundary issue is scheduled for September 1, at the High Court in Kirinyaga.However, he said that the issuance will go ahead because the order has been overtaken by events and it is addressed to the wrong persons.The county lands boss said following the survey and division of 4,000 acres and the parcels registered under the beneficiaries names, there is no land now known as Mwea Settlement scheme. He said the area is now owned by individuals who should have been sued and not the county.
