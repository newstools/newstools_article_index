An MCA from West Pokot wants Education executive Gladys Kiyapyap sacked over alleged misuse of her office and delaying implementation of projects passed by the assembly.Sekerr MCA Thomas Ngolesia said Kiyapyap did not implement the projects the assembly prioritised and has instead diverted the funds to other projects. In the year 2015 the county government through the Ward Development Fund allocated two million shillings to Marich Pass Primary School for the building of a dining hall, he said. We passed it in the assembly and it was assented to by the governor. We expected the project to take off in July 2015 and be completed in June 2016. The CEC has converted the funds to the construction of an administration block. The office is not a priority, he said.The Star visited the school and found pupils eating under trees in the scorching sun.
