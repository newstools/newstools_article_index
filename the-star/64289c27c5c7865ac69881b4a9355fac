Youths will from next month access up to Sh60 million a month from the Youth Enterprise Development Fund, chairman Ronald Osumba has said, in a product restructuring to increase access to credit. This is an ambitious 200 per cent increase from the current Sh20 million a month , a move that will more than double the enterprise s loan portfolio which is currently at Sh11.7 billion.The initiative is expected to bring on board 50,000 young entrepreneurs, adding up to the current 886,313 youth, who have benefited from the fund since its launch in May 2007. We are streamlining processes to bring in efficiency. We plan to invest in robust and efficient systems that will lay the foundation for automation and for availing our services on the mobile phone platform that is popular with our youth, Osumba told the Star in an interview.Local Purchase Orders take the lion share of loan advances where youth are currently accessing up to Sh20 million.Business expansion loans can get up to Sh2 million, individual loans between Sh100,000 and Sh2 million, green house loans between Sh357,000 and Sh430,000 while group loans range between Sh50,000 and Sh400,000Of the Sh11.7 billion advanced to the youth, loans in arrears are to the tune of Sh400 million, but Osumba said most of it is recoverable . Some of these could require rescheduling to recover from a bad crop season, others have their payments delayed by the people they supply with goods while others just require capacity building to help them master financial dynamics in their enterprises, he said.Agribusiness, retail trade and multipurpose mixed business are the common areas of investment, according to the YEDF credit data.The state corporation plans to reduce the loan turnaround period from the current two months to two weeks.Osumba called on youths to take advantage of the kitty to invest. This is the best time to be a young person in Kenya. The resources and opportunities availed by government are unprecedented, Osumba said.The fund seeks to create employment opportunities for young people through entrepreneurship.
