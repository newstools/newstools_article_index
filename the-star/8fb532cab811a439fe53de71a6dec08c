North Rift Kalenjin elders on Saturday told Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago to apologise for leading politicians to storm Moi University.Two weeks ago, Mandago, Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos and some MPs stormed the university to stop acting VC Laban Ayiro from taking over.Instead, they demanded Isaac Kosgey be appointed as VC. The group said Kosgey emerged tops during recruitment interviews. Their action sparked a national debate and drew condemnation of alleged tribal sentiments. Mandago and Tolgos were summoned to record statements at the DCI in Nairobi last week. They have denied making tribal statements.The elders, led by Charles Chebarit and Esther Maiyo, say the leaders have portrayed the community as tribal. Chebarit said the attempt to eject Ayiro from office was ill-advised. We are not happy with the way our leaders, especially Governor Mandago, behaved. The move was uncalled-for, he said.Chebarit and Maiyo said the action could affect the university s image. They said the institution must remain independent.The elders spoke when they met in Kipkorgot. They said Eldoret town is cosmopolitan and Mandago was supported by members all communities in 2013. Chabarit told Kenyans to understand that not all Kalenjins support Mandago s action. Maiyo said, Behaving like a tribal chief is primitive. She said such behaviour undermines cohesion, peace and reconciliation.The elders said they are concerned that the governor has been biased in the distribution of resources within the county. We do not have street lights at Kapkorgot market, unlike other areas. We are perceived to be from a different clan of the Kalenjin community, Maiyo said.
