Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi has dared Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki to table a motion of impeachment against him over the Meru-Tharaka Nithi border dispute.He dismissed Kindiki threats and said problems cannot be resolved by incitement."Kindiki was not there when I was giving out titles deeds in Tharaka Nithi. Why didn't he come? For him to say he will table a motion to impeach me is surprising, as we cannot solve land issues with incitement," Kaimenyi said.Kindiki had on Friday at Kwa Ngombe, Tharaka constituency, threatened to lobby for the impeachment of Kaimenyi. He said the CS has not done enough to solve the Meru Tharaka Nithi border dispute.But Kaimenyi said he has formed a committee to solve the dispute."This dispute has been recurrent, but we want solve it. The committee did their work and have already received a recommendations," he said.He said he will call legislators from both counties to resolve the dispute.
