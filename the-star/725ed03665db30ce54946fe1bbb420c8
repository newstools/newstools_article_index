Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani is in intensive care, especially after its chairman Salim Mvurya joined Jubilee, Pwani University lecturer Prof Halim Shauri has said.He said the Kwale governor s exit has mixed up everything because the JKP has to solve political differences. If Mvurya did not run the group while in the same party with the other governors, how would he do that from the Jubilee side? To the other governors, he looks like a traitor, he said.Speaking at Kanamai in Kilifi on Friday, Shauri said the JKP leadership is virtually dead because it has achieved nothing since its inception in 2013.He said the six Coast counties started on a very good note after the 2013 election, with the aim of forming one economic boc.Shauri said the aim was to put resources together and solve common socio-economic problems.Mvurya dismissed Shauri s claims, saying JKP is doing well and is on course. The brief of JKP was not about party affairs, but priorities of our people, he said.Speaking to the Star on Monday, Mvurya said his joining Jubilee will not affect JKP because he is working tirelessly with the secretariat to get funds from development partners.
