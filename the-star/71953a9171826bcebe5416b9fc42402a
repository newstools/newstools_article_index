Kabondo-Kasipul MP Silvance Osele yesterday warned those eyeing his position to prepare themselves for a tough political battle.Osele said his vision for the constituency cannot be accomplished in five years, so he will seek another term to complete the development projects I have started . He urged residents to judge aspirants based on their development record, before electing them to any position.The legislator told his rivals to stop cheap propaganda and focus on development. He accused 2013 parliamentary losers of tarnishing his track record for selfish gain. They have sensed defeat, he said.Instead, Osele urged the rivals to work with the Homa Bay government to foster economic growth. We need to unite to improve the lives of residents, he said. Many languish in poverty while some leaders are busy politicking. He said he will only engage in peaceful and issue-based campaigns once the time comes. Those expected to run for the seat include former Medical Services director Richard Muga, businessman Herbert Ojwang, banker Obonyo Mireri and Homa Bay Agriculture executive Eliud Otieno.
