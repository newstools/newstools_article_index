Israeli-Kenyan artiste Gilad Millo turned 45, this week. He celebrated his birthday with his fans and fellow musicians by sharing tips and insights he has acquired along the way.Teaming up with Alchemy Creatives Session as part of their weekly free mentorship program, Gilad gave a talk to fellow artistes about believing and investing in yourself in order to make it in the music and entertainment industry.Currently enjoying heavy rotation and media coverage from his Nakuahidi duet with Dela, Gilad has experienced first hand and knows the hardships faced by artistes and those aspiring to make a career out of music. I recorded my bit and then approached Dela after hearing her Swahili cover to Adelle s Hello. The song just felt perfect for her vocals. When I met and played it to her at a parking lot, she agreed to come to the studio later on. In the end, the song had evolved into the emotional ballad that we have, Gilad said. He was stalking me, but when I entered the studio I had so much fun and I changed a few things when he was away and after he returned Gilad loved it. Dela said.Though his music has continuously received support and admiration since the April 2015, release of his debut single, Unajua featuring Wendy Kimani, Gilad has had his fare share of frustration with music. Earlier on, he had to quit music all together at the age of 25 in order to fend for his family since music was not generating any income. His first encounter with music was as part of the White Donkey band in Jerusalem, which later broke up after failing to claim any mainstream commercial success. Through persistence and perseverance, he is now seeing his dreams come to fruition 20 years later. The objective of these sessions was to empower, support and educate artistes on the do's and don'ts of the music industry with an aim of making them earn from their craft.
