A land case against former minister Amos Kimunya will proceed to full hearing.This comes after DPP and EACC declined to have the matter settled out of court.The two agencies had received crucial documents in relation to the matter.Trial magistrate Felix Kombo on Thursday heard that the documents are confidential and sensitive.The court was told that the same only needed to be scrutinised by the court to reach a determination.Consequently, Kombo said the case will be heard for two days from January 23, 2017.The former minister is facing charges of abuse of office, breach of trust and fraudulent disposal of public property during his stint at the ministry of lands.Kimunya has since denied committing the offenses on June 30, 2005 at Ardhi house, Nairobi. He denied conferring a benefit on Midlands Ltd by causing it to be allocated a public plot known as Nyandarua /Njambini 5852.The charge is that he did so while knowing that the said land parcel was not available for alienation.Read: Governor Ongwae testifies against Kimunya in abuse of office case
