Striking Busia nurses have been ordered back to work. The officers in charge henceforth should take roll call and record attendance for future intended action. I wish to thank the staff who defied the order to down their tools, Health chief officer Asoka Itur said in a memo on Wednesday. Asoka said union officials were insincere in marshalling members to strike after walking away from a meeting with county officials. The nurses are demanding pay arrears and promotions. If the nurses persist with the strike, today will be its fourth day. On Wednesday, Busia County Referral Hospital medical superintendent Dr David Mukabi said 20 patients are being attended.. Nurse managers are attending to them. The number could have been high but most patients were transferred by their relatives for fear that they might not get treatment, he said.
