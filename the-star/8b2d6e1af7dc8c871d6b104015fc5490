Three hikers and a tour guide who went missing in the Aberdare on Saturday were found safe and sound on Monday. Search and rescue teams said they were airlifted to Nairobi Hospital and JM Memorial Hospital in Ol Kalou.The four went missing during a mission by 60 people from Nairobi, to the Aberdare mountains in Nyandarua county.The group converged at Gitabushi for the forest hike organised by Buckrest travelers.Stanley Ndung'u, whose daughter Eunice Wanjiru was among those missing, said they were on their way down the mountain when they lost their way. We were told the groups were split into three with one group arriving at the foot of the mountain on time and the others after midnight, he said.Ndung'u said the search was launched after they had waited too long for missing people. My daughter is an avid hiker and has been involved in other exercises. We were not sure what happened but hoped for the best, he said.Kipipiri OCPD Wilson Rotich said that the four were reported missing on Sunday after efforts to find them bore no fruit.Rotich said they mobilised officers from Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Forest Service and police units, and local guides for the operation.He said they carried out searches from the air and on the ground.A local who declined to be named blamed Buckrest saying it hired untrained locals to guide the hikers. Some of the guides are not conversant with the forest, he said, adding the thick terrain and poor visibility by search teams made lengthened the search.
