Kiambu majority leader Patrick Chege, who has been missing for more than a week, returned on Wednesday. He told the assembly men who were accompanied by police kidnapped him after injecting him with a substance that made him unconscious. Chege said when he regained consciousness, he was in hospital. He said he had feared for his life and decided to seek asylum in Ruiru Catholic Church. I stayed with the parish priest, Chege said.He said while he was at the church some men, police and a doctor from a Nairobi hospital forcibly gave him an injection. I was taken by some men accompanied by three policemen. They injected me without my consent and I woke up in hospital, Chege said.Chege said he was held in the hospital and could not contact anyone until residents of Githoua ward came to his rescue after learning of his whereabouts. He urged the speaker to warn those claiming he was sick.On September 17, Chege posted on his Facebook page, To all my friend s pray for me. Kabogo s men Peter Ngaruiya, Joseph Kangethe and the rest want to kill me. I m not Mercy Keino. I m not Kangethe s driver who you killed. You cannot create fear in me for I believe in God. I m not a devil worshiper. The devil worship place is at murere. On September 23, he posted, Watu wa Kabogo wanataka kuniua (Kabogo s people want to kill me). Pray for me. The reason for the abduction was not revealed. Kenyans are individuals. You probably need to see the individuals. I m not aware of such issues. They remain allegations until when you have proper information from the leader or the alleged accused, Governor William Kabogo told the Star in a text yesterday.
