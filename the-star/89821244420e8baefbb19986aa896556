Kilome MP Regina Ndambuki has dared Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to call for mini-polls to send her home for joining Jubilee Party. Ndambuki accused Kalonzo and the Wiper Democratic Movement of frustrating her and expressed confidence in defeating any candidate the outfit will sponsor against her."People want development, not politics of the party one supports. I am sure I will defeat their candidate at 9am if they call for the elections," she said."He will know he is not fighting me but the people of Kilome. Residents have been asking why Kalonzo has been fighting me and are ready for revenge."Ndambuki said the Wiper Party leader has mistreated her since her election in 2013 when she beat 17 contestants."Kalonzo started fighting me after Makueni senator by-elections when he accused me of not supporting Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr. They later removed me from the Administration, National security, and Library committees," she said.Read: Stop threatening defectors with by-elections, MPs tell Cord The lawmaker also dared Kalonzo to visit Kilome where she said residents were waiting to ask him why he has been discriminating against them by sabotaging their leader and frustrating women politicians.Ndambuki and Nominated MP Robert Mutemi were nearly lynched by Wiper supporters after they were accused of being Jubilee moles.They were kicked out of the party s retreat in Maanzoni Lodge, Machakos County in September last year.
