Suspended judge Joseph Mutava yesterday said he will challenge the decision by the tribunal investigating him to recommend his sacking.He said all the complaints against him were withdrawn and faulted the Justice David Maraga-led team for sending him home. Maraga has since been nominated for the Chief Justice job and is set to take office immediately.In a press conference at Museum Hill Centre, Nairobi, through his lawyer Philip Nyachoti, Mutava likened his case to that of President Uhuru Kenyatta at the International Criminal Court in which all complains were withdrawn. The tribunal had no jurisdiction to make any findings. The judge s case is like that of the President at the ICC, Nyachoti said.
