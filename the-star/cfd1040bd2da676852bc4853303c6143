Nelson Marwa has dismissed claims that a police conspiracy resulted in the killing of three women at Central Police station in Mombasa on September 11.The Coast regional coordinator defended police action and maintained the terror suspects hurled a petrol bomb at the station, setting off a fire that prompted officers to open fire.Marwa warned human rights groups against using the incident to create religious animosity in the country. It is a very clear that their intention was to attack the police station. If you are doing NGO business do it the right way; do not propagate hatred between religions using social media, he said.He addressed the media in Mwandoni area, Kisauni, on Wednesday.Read: Mombasa terror suspects rearrested minutes after unconditional releaseBut Muslims for Human Rights chairperson Khelef Khalif maintained his position that the three "innocent girls" were victims of extrajudicial killings.Khalif said the Independent Policing Oversight authority and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights began a probe and that those culpable will be punished. We have presented facts and challenge police to do the same. There is a lot of inconsistency on their part about what really transpired," he told the Star today. If exposing police is inciting the public let him (Marwa) take legal action. Our role is to defend human rights and the rule of law."Maimuna Abdirahman, Ramla Abdirahman and Tasnim Yakubu were killed in what police claimed was an attack aimed at blowing up the station.They said the women pretended they were at the station to report the theft of a mobile phone when one threw the bomb and another stabbed two officers at the report office.Ramla and Maimuna were buried at Manyimbo Muslim Cemetery in Tudor on Saturday after chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor conducted an autopsy in the presence of family members.
