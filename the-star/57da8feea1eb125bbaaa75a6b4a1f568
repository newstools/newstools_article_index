Mombasa-based mixmaster DJ Bunduki is focused on growing young talents in the deejaying industry than making fame for himself.The award-winning spin doctor, who is popular for his street-mix prowess, says that his aim when he founded the Getto Supastarz Entertainment Company in 2009, was to reach out to a bigger audience as a professional DJ, as well as as creating job opportunities for youths.Bunduki, who was born and bred in the coastal city is optimistic that his other projects that purposely target young talents will be a shot in the arm for the deejaying industry and the Kenyan economy."I started out as an in-house DJ in different clubs for five years before going solo as a freelance act," says the 33-year-old Information Technology graduate whose passion for deejaying and music in general started at a tender age.He adds, "My vast experience has been an added value in ensuring that all those young talents taking after me have the best skills not only in the art of deejaying but also in financial management."I did set up a deejaying academy in 2015, and with the growing rate of new students, I have decided to use music mix both in the streets, television and clubs to influence young people in making positive social and economic impact in Kenya and beyond."Having interacted with some world's most popular artistes such as Elephant Man, Chris Martin, I Octane, Future Fambo, I Wayne, Capleton, Denique, Charly Black, Tony Matterhorn and Higher Slice, some of Bunduki's future plans is to venture in the comedy world.He says: "As a creative artist, I aspire to initiate my own comedy show either on radio or television."
