It s wrong for people reporting events- protests by contractors , highlighting events as they unfolded to be roughed up, cameras taken, memory cards erased , this is taking the country backwards, Mungatana said.He challenged the county security officials to arrest and charge the people, agents and public servants associated with the violence against the press. For a contractor to be paid he must be related to the governor, others have stayed without being paid for over two years, he said.
