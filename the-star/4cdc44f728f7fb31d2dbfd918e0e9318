Multi-agency security officers combing for al Shabaab militia in the vast Boni Forest say they have not been paid for three months. The officers from Recce Squad, Rapid Deployment Unit, Administration Police and the Kenya Police said they are neglected.They are deployed in Basuba, Milimani, Ishakani, Usalama, Baure, Malalani, Kiangwe, Manghai and Kiunga.The officers have asked Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to demand accountability from senior officers at police headquarters responsible for their upkeep and allowances. We have not been paid our allowances for the past three months and we are not even getting proper food, one of them said. Police spokesperson George Kinoti said he will follow up. It s very shocking. Normally, the Inspector General of Police doesn t want to hear officers crying over unpaid allowances, he said.
