Ninety-six girls rescued from female genital mutilation and early marriages in West Pokot have graduated from St Elizabeth Girls Centre in Ortum.They were trained in ICT, digital media, web design, coding and financial literacy. Speaking during the graduation on Friday, Anti-FGM Board chairperson Linah Kilimo praised the girls - most of whom had run away from their homes to avoid being married off. This is a great achievement. It is better to be baptised a rebel than have an important part of your body cut off and being forced into marriage at a tender age, she said.She urged the girls to be anti-FGM ambassadors. Tell younger girls to refuse to be compared to how many cows they can fetch. You are all much more important than those animals your parents seek as they marry you off, Kilimo said.
