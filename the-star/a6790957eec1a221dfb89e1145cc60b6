Turkana Governor Josephat Nanok on Monday expressed concern over the ability of the IEBC to conduct a credible Kalokol ward by-election on October 26.Nanok said he doubts the returning and deputy returning officers appointed and gazetted will ensure credibility, saying political parties were not consulted as required by the law.He said the two officials are well known by the public as sympathisers and close relatives of Jubilee politicians. The seat fell vacant after Ford Kenya MCA Lochakolong Lolimo died three months ago.Nanok said is a plot by Jubilee to have its way in the by-election. He said ODM has written to the IEBC about the issue.
