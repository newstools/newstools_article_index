Maize farmer Samuel Mushai warded off competition from six rivals in the T.11 1,500m final to grab his second gold medal at the Olympics Stadium in the ongoing Rio Paralympic Games yesterday. The win means Kenya now have four medals, two gold and two bronze. Mushai gave Kenya the first gold in the T.11 5,000m. The bronze medals cam via the efforts of Wilson Bii (T.11 5,000m) and Henry Kirwa (T.12/13 1,500m).Mushai remains the reigning world record holder in the T.11 1,500m. He had aimed to smash his own record (3:58.37) set in the 2012 London Paralympics.With his guide James Boit, Mushai saw off close competition from Brazil s multiple world champion Odiar Santos who races without a running partner.The Team Kenya captain ran side by side with the Brazilian, his all time rival, before he stepped up his pace with a 100m to the finish line, clocking 4:03.25 for first place. The Kitale-based farmer beat Santos by 0.60 seconds as the South American timed 4:03.85. Turk Deniz Semih, guided by Muhammed Emin sealed ther final podium place, crossing the finish line in 4:05.42. After winning his heat (the slowest of the three) on Sunday evening in 4:13.20, Kenya s Wilson Bii missed the bronze medal placing fourth in the final in 4:07.96.Canadian Jason Dinkerley, and guide Josh Karanja were fifth (4:07.98), whereas Japanese Shinya Wada and running partner Nakata Takashi finished last in 4:15.62. I feel fulfilled. Defeating Santos is not easy, and beating him- a multiple world champion- a second time within days in our categories is awesome. It is always tough competing with Santos. This does not happen every day, intimated the jubilant Mushai who had also beaten the Brazilian to second place in the T.11 5,000m race which opened the Games.Mushai and Santos rivalry dates back to 2011 when the latter beat the Kenyan to silver at the International Paralympics Committee World Athletics Championships in Christchurch, New Zealand. I have achieved the best for the team and I now look forward to other world events, added the 26 year-old athlete.The 2016 Paralympics T.12/13 1,500m bronze medallist Henry Kirwa will today race in the T.12/13 5,000m final. Nancy Chelangat who did not go beyond the heats of women s T.11 200m, is up against her equals, and world s best in the T.11 1,500m heats.
