TRANS Nzoia county has identified real estate development as one of its flagship sectors under its Sh30 billion master plan for growth.The county projects housing deficit in Kitale, its headquarters and a major national food basket centre, at about 200,000 modern housing units in the next few years, especially for the growing middle-income earners.Governor Patrick Khaemba says the high demand for modern housing in the town will attract many investors. There are key investment opportunities in real estate and construction, residential villas, town houses and even commercial units in almost all parts of Trans Nzoia, Khaemba said.The county will host its investment conference next week and Khaemba hopes to ink partnership deals with private developers. We have both local and foreign investors who have made inquiries to partner with us in the housing sector, he said. Kitale town has a population of more than 300,000 people but it lacks adequate housing to accommodate the increasing population.Khaemba says demand for land in Kitale has gone up since last year after the county government and the National Land Commission streamlined the issuing of title deeds.More than 100,000 title deeds have been issued to land owners since last November, he said.Khaemba added that the titling programme has also given confidence to investors eyeing property development in the town.Property dealers have flocked the town, where the average asking price for 50 by 100 feet plots has shot up to as much as Sh1.5 million.The governor has backed the housing and construction sectors to drive the economy of the county.
