"Kenya is governed by law and police are no exception. Civilians have been killed during demonstrations in pars of the country including Nairobi, Kisumu and Siaya but the CS said "a few rascals do not justify condemnation of the whole force".He said the government was aware of a conspiracy by "non-elements" to undermine the work of the National Police Service."The media is biased against police in its blanket condemnation of the service.
