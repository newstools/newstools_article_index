Parents in Lari will be arrested if their children are found tilling land during school hours, area deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros has said. It is not bad to train children to till land, but we must do it during holidays or weekends. Our students must go to school, he said.Koros ordered chiefs to carry out impromptu checks in villages to ensure no student is farming during class time. It is frustrating that some of our students are going on with the syllabus while others are tilling the land ... We will not allow that, he said.Koros responded to concerns raised by area director of education Stephen Kitungu, who said many students in Kinale are farming and selling vegetables instead of going to school. The two spoke on Monday in Kimende when area MP Mburu Kahangara distributed revision materials to schools.
