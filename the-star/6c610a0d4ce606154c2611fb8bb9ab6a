There was drama at the Webuye county hospital on Saturday when faithful from Temple of God church stormed the facility's mortuary "to resurrect the dead".Five members of the church of more than 200 members told the press that they had been sent by the holy spirit to pray for the sick, heal them and resurrect the dead.Led by self-proclaimed prophet Daniel Wechuli, the five among them three ladies, claimed to have healed several people in western region through their prayers."We have been moving to various hospitals praying for the sick and most of then have been healed by faith," Wechuli said.He said that the holy spirit had spoken to them to come and resurrect people who had died prematurely."We are divine people who are anointed by the holy spirit to move to hospitals preaching and healing the sick without asking for any penny," he said.He said that the church is located at Mbande area, Kakamega county. Caroline Wafula, a member of the church, said that they have led healing prayers for people living with disabilities and bodaboda riders."We want to show people the power of God in their lives through our church that has been healing and restoring lives to God," she said.She said that their task is only to pray and one's faith is what matters if he wants to be healed."We have been to Malava hospital where we prayed and all the sick were healed and left the ward," Wafula said.She said that they started the prayers in July and have been to Vihiga, Kakamega and Malava where they have received overwhelming healing testimonies.However, no one had resurrected by press time as the group kept on praying. Residents of Webuye jammed the facility to take a look at the strange incident.
