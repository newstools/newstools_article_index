Former National Assembly speaker Francis Ole Kaparo on Friday told off opposition leader Raila Odinga for allegedly lying using his name.Kaparo said the allegations made by Raila during the late minister William Ole Ntimama's burial that he (Raila) sought his permission to allow Ntimama to address parliament were false."Mtu ambaye ako na miaka mingi kunishinda kudanganya kwamba alikuwa ananiomba ruhusa ndio Ntimama aongee kwa bunge ni uongo mtupu, Wakenya wajue haikufanyika". Loosely translated to, "A man who is even older than I am should not lie that he in any way talked to me to give the late Ntimama a chance to speak in parliament, that is an outright lie and the country should know it never happened."Kaparo was addressing residents at Doldol, Laikipia County during a funds drive. The NCIC chairman was accompanied by leader of majority Aden Duale who was representing DP William Ruto at the event."It is wrong to make such allegations because during my tenure as speaker of Parliament i was not forced or even asked to favour anyone because it is a fair house," Kaparo added.At one point, Uhuru told Raila Kumeza mate si kula nyama.
