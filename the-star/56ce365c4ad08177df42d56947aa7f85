Hundreds of ODM supporters in Malindi yesterday stormed the party offices, protesting against alleged hypocrisy and lack of good will among elected leaders in running party affairs.The supporters gave a three-day ultimatum to the leaders to open the offices, which were closed immediately after the by-election on March 7 or else, they will ditch the party.They said the party is losing popularity in the region at the expense of the Jubilee Party due to bad leadership.The supporters accused elected leaders of pretending to please party leader Raila Odinga so that they get nominations and win elections. In 2013 general election, all the elected leaders in the constituency won on the ODM ticket. Boaz Kiir, a strong local ODM supporter, said they are disappointed and may opt vote to ODM only for the presidential candidate and elect other leaders from other parties. Addressing journalists outside the locked party offices, he said the elected ODM leaders have no interest in popularising the party. He said the problem has led to the closure of all ODM offices in Kilifi county. We have no faith in the current ODM elected leaders. They have contributed to the mismanagement of party affairs at the grassroots, Kiir said. It s encouraging to see other leaders leading by example in encouraging residents to register as voters but in Kilifi, things are different. Leaders will only appear during the nominations. We will not allow such leaders to mislead the party leader for their own personal gain, he said.The Jubilee Party plans to open offices in all the 7 constituencies in the Coast.
