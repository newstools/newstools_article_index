Senators yesterday took Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga to task over his administration s illegal tendering and purchases worth millions of shillings.The audit report for 2013-14 showed the county violated procurement laws, leading to overspending of Sh69 million, which was 77 per cent of the approved budget. This broke the legal 10 per cent required for contract variation.Rasanga, appearing before the Senate Public Accounts Committee, failed to convince members.The committee questioned the county executive why it varied the contract for purchase of 24 second-hand vehicles from Toyota Kenya for the Health department by spending Sh159 million and not Sh89 million indicated on the budget. The over-expenditure was not approved by the county assembly through a supplementary budget, the report reads. Rasanga was accompanied by his CEC members. He said the report gives incorrect finding by failing to consider the entire budget for motor vehicle purchase.The governor and his officials said they did not break tendering laws because the approved budget was Sh199 million and not Sh89 million. Allocation for the purchase was provided under various departments but the execution was done centrally, Rasanga said. The important thing is that the projects were implemented. The committee took issue with his sentiment that all projects were completed. Senator Martha Wangari said three former Nyeri county officials were jailed this week for similar irregular procurement practices.Senators Bonny Khalwale and Kimani Wamatangi demanded an explanation on Sh13 million pickups bought from Bhogal Auto-World in Kericho through open tendering,. They said no adverts were placed in the media as required by law.But Rasanga said Toyota Kenya referred them to the company after it ran out of stock. The committee also sought an explanation on an early payment of Sh2.95 million for constructing ECDE classrooms at Awelo and Sihayi primary schools.
