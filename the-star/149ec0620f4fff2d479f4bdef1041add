A section of MPs whose UDF party was dissolved for Jubilee are mulling options that will enable them to remain in the ballot for the 2017 poll.The legislators, some of whom have said their backyards have turned hostile, are planning a protest to the Registrar of Political parties.They said they will demand that the registrar allows them to run independently or join other parties without attracting sanctions.The MPs are confident that independence will not subject them to new party rules or intimidation by officials who will be named to steer Jubilee Party.They told the Star on Monday that they will inform the registrar, should they decide to be independent, before the lapse of the 30-day deadline stipulated by law.Vihiga Senator George Khaniri (UDF) has led the pack of those who fear they might be disgruntled in the new outfit that President Uhuru Kenyatta will use to seek re-election."We have three options; stay in the new party, join another party or go independent as required by the new political parties Act," Khaniri said.The MP said he was not comfortable in Jubilee Party since the merger was poorly managed and there was no agenda for Kenyans."I have notified the registrar that I do not want anything to do with the newly launched JP. I don t like how they conduct their business and how they run the country," he told the Star on phone from Johannesburg, South Africa.The legislator said Jubilee was not popular at the grassroots because of tribalism and corruption in the government, making it hard to sell the party to voters."We do not move alone as leaders. The electorate take us where we belong and dictate what we do for them," he said.He added that Jubilee's days of being in power were numbered due to corruption and poor service delivery.Read: Jubilee wants to bar nomination losers from joining other partiesLugari MP Ayub Savula said he will wait for the current term of parliament to end before he jumps ship."We have an agreement with Jubilee on working together.
