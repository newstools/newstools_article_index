Africa Nazarene University s men s and women s softball teams are looking to stage an impressive performance in the 2016/17 national league.After all their players completed their training at the institution in May, head coach Peter Anyanzwa has been forced to recruit green-fresh players who will represent the varsity in the national league.The women s side finished fourth behind Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Multimedia University and Kenyatta University respectively in the 2015/16 league season, whereas the men s squad competed halfway into the league (till December) and then fell off, owing to final year class work engagement.Anyanzwa faulted his, and largely the university s team enrolment approach and have now resolved to recruit new players year round. The last time players were recruited into the ANU softball teams was three years ago. There is no continuity in the team this season but we are hopeful our current outfit will form up promptly as we compete in the league. We have learnt our lesson and given that softball is not played in Secondary Schools in Kenya, we will recruit at the slightest chance we spot a potential player, said Anyanzwa, also an assistant coach of the women s national team. Both sides have responded very well, they have mastered the basics within a few weeks and we will polish them up as we proceed.
