Kitui Governor Julius Malombe, 61, has said it would be a grave mistake and a step backward for residents to replace him with an older candidate. I cannot reconcile myself with the scenario of handing over the Kitui governorship to a tired elderly leader who is past his sell-by date. It will slow down the pace of development I have set, he said. Malombe spoke in Mulango ward on Thursday, when he inspected projects. He said he is confident he will beat Kitui Senator David Musila, 73, and former Lands CS Charity Ngilu, 64. Malombe said he plans to hand over to a young leader in 2022. I want to hand over the mantle to a younger, agile and progressive leader bubbling with energy. This vast county needs an intellectual and younger leader to maintain the development tempo my administration has set, he said.Malombe urged residents to reject the older leaders seeking dislodge him. In order for our county to move forward, we must nurture the spirit and culture of handing over leadership to younger people. It is wrong to recycle leaders who have served their time and should be in retirement. Kitui is not short of young capable and intelligent leaders, he said.The governor said both Musila and Ngilu have been in public leadership for decades. Their continued clamour for leadership reveals their contempt for younger leaders capacity and their insatiable greed for power, Malombe said.Musila laughed off Malombe s comments. Speaking at Kabati trade centres in Kitui West town during a football tournament, he told the crowd that he is Malombe s agemate.
