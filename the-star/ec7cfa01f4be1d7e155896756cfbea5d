Most food prices have stabilised and costs have declined, except for the cost of a bag of beans that has gone up by Sh95, according to the August food report.The report attributed the decline in prices to good rains. It says a 2kg packet of maize flour has dropped by Sh2 to Sh104.8 from Sh106.2 in July 2016.The average price of a 90kg bag of maize is now at Sh2,895, down from Sh2,935, in July. The price of a bag of beans is Sh6,430, an increase from Sh6,335 in the same month. The price of a bag of potatoes is Sh2,525, down from Sh2,865 in July, the report says.According to the report, maize stocks stand at 9,622,300, an increase from 7,546,397 bags in July 2016. This is due to a peak harvesting of the long-rains crops, which continued in Central, Eastern and Coast throughout August. Bean stocks stand at 1,162,270 bags, rice at 576,490 and wheat at 2,580,000 bags.The report projects an estimated long-rain harvest between September and December at 14 million bags, with an estimated post harvest storage loss of 2,392,231 bags.
