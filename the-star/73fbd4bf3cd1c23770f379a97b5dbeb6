A Kwale MCA has condemned the Thursday killing of a tuk-tuk driver by police.Swalehe Simba said careless officers should be punished. He said it is unfortunate that officers expected to protect residents turn against them. An officer is said to have been pursuing drug peddlers who hijacked a tuk-tuk at Tiwi in Matuga. Witnesses said the officer accidentally killed the driver after missing the peddlers who jumped off the tuk-tuk on realising the officer was shooting at them.But Simba said the officer s recklessness caused the death of Tsuma Mumbo who was driving towards Likoni from Ukunda. Why couldn t he chase the peddlers using a police vehicle?
