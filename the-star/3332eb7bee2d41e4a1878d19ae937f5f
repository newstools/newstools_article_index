A pendant rapper Tupac Shakur wore on the night he was shot in Manhattan has been put up for sale.The gold necklace was reportedly hit by a bullet when a gunman opened fire on the musician in the lobby of New York's Quad Recording Studios.The dented pendant has been listed by memorabilia dealer Moments in Time for $125,000 (Sh12.5 million).However, the celebrity website has claimed the rapper's family are strongly opposed to any sale and will file a lawsuit against anyone who tries to buy or sell the necklace. The day after the November 30, 1994 shooting, Tupac checked himself out of hospital three hours after surgery and appeared in court on sex assault charges.Appearing in court in a wheelchair, he was found guilty of three counts of molestation and found not guilty of six others, including sodomy, stemming from his 1993 arrest for sexual assault.He was later sentenced to up to four and a half years in jail.After serving nine months of his sentence, he was released in October 1995, largely thanks to the influence of Suge Knight, the CEO of Death Row Records, who posted a $1.4million bail pending appeal of the conviction, in exchange for the rapper releasing three albums under the Death Row label.Tupac was travelling with Knight when he was fatally shot multiple times while leaving a boxing event in Las Vegas on September 7, 1996.He died in hospital six days later.The pair, who had attended the heavyweight fight between Bruce Seldon and Mike Tyson earlier in the evening, were on their way to a party at Club 662.The auction of the pendant comes after a Bible Tupac read in jail was listed by Moments In Time for $54,000 (Sh5.4 million).
