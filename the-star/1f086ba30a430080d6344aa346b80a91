County governments will be ranked from next year according to how well they handle solid waste.Environment CS Judi Wakhungu on Thursday said the ministry had developed 10 minimum requirements on waste collection and transportation, management of existing disposal sites and licensing.She said this will ensure compliance with the Environmental Management and Coordination Regulations, 2006. The management of waste in the country still remains a major challenge as most urban areas and counties lack requisite waste handling infrastructure, Wakhungu said in a speech.It was read on her behalf by Environment PS Charles Sunkuli during a dinner on improved solid waste management in Kenya.During the gala at the Sarova Stanley Hotel in Nairobi, a scorecard on waste management was also launched. Nairobi, for instance, has been grappling with a garbage problem.Wakhungu said poor waste management has hurt the environment, public health, economy and image of the country, and has exacerbated climate change.The CS said the National Environment Policy, 2014, has been developed and it provides a holistic framework for the management of the environment and natural resources. The policy ensures that environmental matters are integrated in all government policies to facilitate and realise sustainable development at all levels, she said.The ministry on August 16 launched the Rapid Results Initiative. It s activities in the next 100 days include raising awareness and enforcement of environmental regulations and standards.Under the 10 minimum requirements, counties are expected to ensure that waste collection areas are zoned.They are to ensure timely and regular collection of all solid waste, either through door-to-door collection or from centralised collection points.While transporting waste, counties must ensure all collected waste is transported using NEMA-licensed vehicles to designated disposal sites.Dumping sites must also be secured with a fence and a gate manned by a county government official to control dumping and prevent spread of waste outside the disposal site.National Environment Management Authority director general Geoffrey Wahungu urged counties to make available billboards that Nema can use to reach the masses.He urged the private sector to partner with Nema to make the country clean. Investors are attracted to clean and secure places, Wahungu said.
