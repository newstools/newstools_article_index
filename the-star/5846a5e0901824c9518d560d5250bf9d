Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago yesterday told his rivals to stop spreadinglies about his performance and said he is certain of reelection.Mandago said he had not sidelined any part of the county or community, as claimed by some seeking to occupy his office. Those who want positions should sell their manifestos based on the truth. Cheap propaganda will not help them, Mandago said.He said his rivals have been rubbishing his government s performance in the past four years as a strategy to win. We ve been distributing resources equally to all the six subcounties without favouritism. Those claiming otherwise should better look for other reasons to campaign, the governor said. He spoke at Kipsomba ward.With the general election less than 10 months off, the contest for governor now appears to be a two-horse race.The incumbent will face newcomer Edward Serem, the chief Health officer in neighbouring Nandi county. He has announced he will challenge Mandago for the Jubilee Party ticket. I will be vying on the Jubilee ticket but I will say more at the right time, Serem said. Kenya s ambassador to Pakistan Julius Bitok is yet to confirm if he will run while Margaret Kamar has opted for Senate.
