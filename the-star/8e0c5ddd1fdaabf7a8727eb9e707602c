The government is this morning meeting the Kenya Airline Pilots Association and Kenya Airways management to resolve the stalemate between the airline and its pilots, a day before tomorrow s planned strike.Labour Cabinet Secretary Phyllis Kandie on Friday wrote to the two parties, where she also appointed a five-member committee to resolve the standoff,.KALPA has called for the immediate resignation of Kenya Airways CEO Mbuvi Ngunze and chairman Ambasador Dennis Awoti.In the letter, Kandie said the call for resignation of KQ top bosses cannot be termed as a trade dispute to be subjected to conciliation process as stipulated in section 76 of the labour regulations Act, 2007, to warrant the contemplated action. However in the interest of cordial and harmonious industrial relations, I have appointed a conciliation committee to assist the parties find an amicable solution, Kandie said in the letter copied to the Transport ministry, Federation of Kenya Employers, COTU, the ministry s chief industrial relations officer and the Nairobi county labor officer.KALPA secretary general Paul Gichinga yesterday told the Star the tomorrows strike is still on despite an injunction issues by the High Court on Friday. We have not been served so yes the strike is on. However we are meeting the government of Kenya on Monday plus KQ board at the ministry of labour, Gichinga said.The latest developments on the pilots strike come amid continued operational hitches at the national carrier, which has gained notoriety for flight cancellation and delays in the last one month.Yesterday, KQ cancelled five flights at its Jomo Kenyatta International Airport hub- KQ 600 to Mombasa, KQ 432 to Kilimajaro,KQ 350 to Juba,KQ 706 to Lusaka/Harare and KQ 740 to Maputo. KQ 782 to Livingston/Capetown was delayed.The airline attributed the cancellation to shortage of flight crew. Some of our outsourced staff including cabin crew have stayed away from work from Friday and we are working with their employer to resolve any issues they may have, KQ said in a statement.On satrurday, KQ101(dreamliner B787 registration 5Y-KZC) flight from London was cancelled due to technical issues. The pilots issued a seven days strike notice last Tuesday, calling for the resignation Ngunze and Ambassador Awori, over alleged mismanagement.KQ recorded a tax loss of Sh26.2 billion posted for the year that ended March 31.A mass exodus of pilots and engineers has been blamed for increased technical hitches at the national airline, which is losing talent to rival rich Middle East carriers among them Qatar Airline and Emirates. About 75 pilots and 50 engineers have left the airline in the last one and a half years, the Kenya Airline Pilots Association said.This has left KQ with about 450 pilots from 525 one and a half years ago.
