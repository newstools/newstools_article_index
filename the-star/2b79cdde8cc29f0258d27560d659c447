Politicians' manifestos devoid of infrastructural development should be ignored, Nyali parliamentary hopeful Ashiraf Bayusuf has said.Bayusuf said failure to investment in infrastructure means failure to grow and develop the social and economic fabric.All levels of government must have a stake in this, he said, noting Mombasa's approach to the matter will determine its future.The aspirant who will vie for the seat on an ODM ticket, said tourism will grow and employment created for the county's 60 per cent jobless population.Bayusuf said county and national governments must create the right conditions for investment, even where it is led by the private sector. The development of most constituencies, Nyali to be precise, has been curtailed by lack of goodwill from county government, he said in Bamburi on Tuesday. Nyali has the potential to spur the economy of Mombasa. It s a constituency that hosts most tourists hotels. A good working environment will translate to profits and job creation."Bayusuf said financial and regulatory conditions must be carefully considered so that development is long term. If this happens in constituencies across the country, the economy will grow in double digits, he said.The Jubilee government said it has prioritised infrastructure development to spur growth and job creation in all sectors of Kenya's economy.President Uhuru Kenyatta said infrastructure development is key to ensuring access to decent incomes and livelihoods for all, with special focus on youths.Incumbent MP Hezron Awiti (Wiper) is eying the Governor seat held by Hassan Joho.Awiti has had a frosty relationship with Joho, over the county's sluggish approach to its constitutional mandate to develop the constituency.Read: Awiti officially launches bid for Mombasa governor, vows to transform countyAlso read: Awiti, Joho fight to control Nyali politics, win upcountry voters
