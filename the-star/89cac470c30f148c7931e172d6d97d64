Ex-Uchumi managers' date with the court looms after former chief finance officer Chadwick Okumu was quizzed by the DCI detectives yesterday over alleged fraud at the company and embezzlement of funds.The Director of Criminal Investigation Muhoro Ndegwa confirmed that investigations into the Uchumi Supermarkets scam had been finalised, and the suspects were scheduled to appear in court."I've not been briefed of the arrest but I know investigations had been completed, and suspects were to take plea today," Muhoro said.DCI detectives yesterday picked up former CFO Okumu and drove him to their Kiambu Road headquarters to take his fingerprints in readiness for his court appearance.The detectives were reportedly looking for former CEO Jonathan Ciano who is also likely to be charged alongside Okumu.The arrest of the people suspected to be behind the loss of funds and mismanagement of Uchumi is one of the four conditions the government set for the firm to adhere to before bailout funds are released.On August 6, the government announced that it had gathered enough evidence to charge some of the senior officials of the troubled retail firm implicated in the mismanagement of the company.State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the government had conducted a forensic audit and found the former managers culpable. The money going into Uchumi comes from Kenyans' hard-earned taxes. They want to satisfy themselves that it will be used properly. Properly managed, it provides an excellent outlet for Kenyan products. We believe that that opportunity should not be lost, which is the reason for the proposed cash injection, Esipisu said in a statement.This came as State House announced that Industry and Cooperatives Cabinet secretary Adan Mohammed would present a proposal for the injection of Sh1.2 billion into the Uchumi supermarkets.The other three conditions for the disbursement of the bailout package are that the new management show evidence that the turnaround plan is working. The managers are also expected to prove their competency - a move that included a background check on their previous jobs, and a clear outline of how the bailout funds will be repaid.
