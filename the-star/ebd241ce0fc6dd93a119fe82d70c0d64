Bungoma MCAs have dismissed the Jubilee Party interim national officials announced on Thursday by interim committee chairman Noah Wekesa. Speaking to the media in Bungoma town yesterday, majority leader Henry Nyongesa said the former Jubilee Alliance Party officials, who now lead JP, do not reflect the face of Kenya . You cannot purport that the Jubilee Party is a national outfit, yet all officials come from two tribes, Nyongesa said.The MCAs said unless the interim officials are changed, the party will look like TNA and URP, which majorly consisted of two tribes. In our agreement before the dissolution, the national chairman or secretary general were to come from Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka s New Ford Kenya. We don t want anything else. Let us stick to the agreement, Nyongesa said.He said it would be difficult to sell JP in the region if New Ford Kenya members don t get top seats.
