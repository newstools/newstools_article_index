It seems likely the high political temperatures of the past weeks are at last cooling down. So we can now turn our attention to questions of greater significance than that of whether there will be tear gas floating in Nairobi next Monday.A foreigner looking at Kenya over the past few weeks might easily have concluded that we are a bitterly divided nation. And that possibly, we are divided beyond any possibility of genuine reconciliation.But the fact is that we are not. There are a surprising number of issues on which there is a broad national consensus. What we seem to differ on is who will get to deliver on the benefits of this national consensus.There are those who believe that the current team in power President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto is singularly incapable of steering the nation towards these desired ends. And that all those who claim to be nationalists must rush to the forefront and help uproot the Jubilee government from power at the next election.On the other side of the political divide are those who believe with all their hearts that no greater tragedy could come to our country than that former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and the d to power. And so their every waking moment is dedicated to stopping this apocalypse.I may also add here that viewed in purely psychological terms in their body language, so to speak each team reveals a deep-seated anxiety about their chances of victory.Top figures of the governing Jubilee alliance will routinely talk as if the outcome of the 2017 election is already decided in Uhuru s favour. And yet they will at the same time resort to the most paranoid accusations of deep schemes to overthrow the government with the help of foreigners , and generally act as though they are under siege.The opposition team too, will often boast about the certainty of their victory, arguing that they will be running against a corrupt and inept government in 2017.But they too and particularly in their street protests act as though they are opposing an overwhelmingly powerful and deeply entrenched tyranny, rather than a transient political alliance.So much for our superficial divisions. Now let us consider something more fundamental: what is this national consensus on what the country really needs?And I am glad to point out that this assumes a generalised formula: No matter who leads Kenya in years to come, clearly what they will have to seek to do is first to restore a degree of agrarian prosperity to the majority of Kenyans who live in rural areas. And second to create more and better paying jobs in the cities to allow the millions who currently live in slums to rise to a better standard of living.And whether we talk about planned reductions of the cost of power; the need for improved road networks; the much-hyped schools laptop project; loans for the youth or for women; in the end the ultimate objective is to achieve those two broad objectives.To illustrate what I mean, take the example of the transport infrastructure.Our immediate former President Mwai Kibaki is widely credited with having improved our roads, ports and airports beyond all recognition, having come in when all Kenyan roads (by definition) had potholes; the port of Mombasa was hopelessly inefficient; and JKIA was a filthy mess of an airport.Clearly, these grand infrastructure projects were but a means to an end.Rural roads are intended to help bring prosperity by making it easier for farmers to send their produce to markets, near and far. The larger and more efficient port is supposed to spur trade and create jobs. A cleaner and more efficient airport will encourage more tourists to come to Kenya, also creating more jobs.As I said, what needs to be done is clear enough.Where we differ is on who will ascend to high office and make the effort to get these things done.
