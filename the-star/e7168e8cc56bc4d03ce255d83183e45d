The Parliamentary Committee on Land has promised to resolve the protracted Nanga Kihoto land dispute in Naivasha in a months time.This came as the committee summoned a leading Naivasha farmer involved in the dispute with some former directors and 1,700 members.Committee acting chairman Paul Otuoma (pictured) said they will study documents presented by the feuding leaders.He spoke after a fact-finding mission in Naivasha yesterday.Otuoma said the petition about the leadership tussle was brought to Parliament by Murang a woman representative Sabina Chege. We have listened to the grievances by the two parties and we will issue a report after 30 days, Otuoma said.Chege urged the committee to probe attempted irregular transfers of land and fraudulent fund withdrawals from the company s accounts.The majority of the shareholders are from her Gatanga backyard. The woman representative said the last AGM was held in 2012. Efforts to hold subsequent AGMs to deliberate on subdivision of the plots have been futile, Chege said.She accused former director Pharis Mburu Ngugi of irregularly withdrawing Sh495,000 from the company s accounts.Chege wants the committee to place a caveat on the land until an AGM is held to resolve outstanding matters.Company treasurer Francis Muheria accused rivals of attempting to sell the 1,300 acres against their wishes.
