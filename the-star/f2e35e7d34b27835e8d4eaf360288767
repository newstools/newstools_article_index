President Barack Obama and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi met at the White House on Tuesday, discussing critical upcoming votes in both nations and the link between the sluggish European economy and populist discontent in the continent. The spotlight from the final state visit of Obama's presidency comes at an opportune time for Renzi, who seeks a boost ahead of a constitutional referendum on December 4 that could determine his political future. But even Renzi admitted that the US presidential election on November 8 loomed larger. "I have a feeling, and I think that rightly so, our American friends are a little more interested in November 8 than in the Italian vote on constitutional reform, and so are we, might I add," Renzi said, drawing laughter from the Rose Garden press conference. Obama slammed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for "whining" that the US election is "rigged." He praised Renzi's proposed economic reforms, and said he supported the attempt to modernise its political institutions at the referendum because it would help accelerate economic changes. "I do believe that there is a connection between stagnation and some of the less constructive, populist impulses that have been rising up," Obama said, saying more jobs needed to be created for Europe's younger generation. This is the second time this year Obama has weighed in on domestic political battles facing his European allies. In April, he visited London in support of former Prime Minister David Cameron's unsuccessful efforts to persuade Britain to vote to remain in the European Union.The leaders also discussed the fight against Islamic State and battle to take the Iraqi city of Mosul from the militant group. Obama insisted the US-led coalition had a plan to deal with what could be "heart-breaking" humanitarian consequences of the fight.
