Kenyans should expect next year s soaring multi-trillion budget by May before Parliament dissolves for the August general election.National Treasury CS Henry Rotich will have to present the budget much earlier away from the June tradition because the unfamiliar August polls date interferes with the 2017-18 budget-making process.National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale said the House will give priority to budget issues when the MPs resume from recess on October 4. Upon resumption of the House, there will be eight months remaining to the general elections. Therefore, come October, we may have to alter the calendar of the House to allow for the consideration of budget-related items for the 2017-18 financial year, including the Budget Policy Statement, he said.Parliament dissolves by June at a critical time when MPs should approve and authorise both national and county governments allocations.
