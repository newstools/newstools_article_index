Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has said he will maintain his good relationship and cooperation with President Uhuru Kenyatta, despite ditching Jubilee for ANC. Timamy was elected on a UDF ticket on March 4, 2013. On July 21, he announced he would leave UDF for the new Jubilee Party, which was formed on September 10.On October 3, he said he is no longer interested in Jubilee or Cord, as they have many candidates. He announced he would run for reelection on an Amani ticket. Speaking in Lamu on Sunday, Timamy said the Lamu government will continue cooperating with and respecting the national government. My move from Jubilee to ANC is a personal one and I shall not mix it with my mandate to serve the people of Lamu. I will continue working with the President, he said. Some politicians in Lamu say Timamy s defection from Jubilee might result in Lamu being denied benefits by the national government.
