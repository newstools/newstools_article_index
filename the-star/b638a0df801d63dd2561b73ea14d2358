Jubilee has implemented many projects in Northeastern, a region that was behind in development, Garissa Town MP Aden Duale has said.It has also given Northeastern people ministerial and ambassadorial positions, and residents should reward it by reelecting the Jubilee leaders, he said.The National Assembly majority leader spoke on Saturday at a fundraising for Madarassul Abuhuraira in Adamasajide ward, Wajir county.He urged the Northeastern counties to reward the Jubilee administration by reelecting the leaders. The Nunow-Madogashe road will be finished end of 2016, the Mandera-Elwak road is already on course and the certificate of the Madogasge-Wajir road will be issued within this month, Duale said.The majority leader criticised Wajir leaders for duping residents into the opposition, saying the region needs to be an ally of the government and residents should not be blind Cord fanatics. The Jubilee government has given us free hospitals, access roads and jobs, not meaningless pledges, Duale said.
