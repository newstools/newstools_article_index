The initiative kicked off in Kisii county as a means of spurring development and job creation in rural areas. We are rolling this out in Kisii as part of our efforts to drive development and sustainable growth across the country, said Irene Onyancha Marketing and Business Development Manager.According to the Ministry of Public Service, Youth and Gender, 90 per cent of all young unemployed people in Kenya lack vocational skills. Bamburi plans to place 12 containers by end of 2016, targeting youth groups in Kisii, Nyamira, Migori, Kisumu, Siaya, Kakamega, Kitale and Eldoret. The youth groups will have retail accounts with Bamburi Cement from which they can purchase cement . The company will deliver the cement to them in the respective areas that they will be operating.
