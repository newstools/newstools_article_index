ODM and Jubilee supporters in the city could clash on Sunday after each side insisted they would go on with rallies at a contested venue.Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero said ODM s rally at Masinde Muliro grounds in Mathare remains unchanged.But MP Steven Kariuki said he booked the venue and Jubilee supporters will converge at the venue after he finishes a tour of development projects in the constituency.Kariuki, alias K1, said he has organised a mega rally to popularise the recently launched Jubilee Party.The first term MP, who is also Bishop Margaret Wanjiru s son, defected from ODM to JP last Saturday.Kidero said it will be one of the biggest events to be held by the party and will be attended by party leader Raila Odinga. The Nairobi governor addressed the media Orange House yesterday. This is going to be the mother of all the rallies in this city by the party in the recent past. It is going to be bigger than what happened in Mombasa last weekend, Kidero said.The governor is the custodian of county property, among them venues for public rallies and religious conventions.The Orange House briefing was attended by ODM acting secretary general and nominated Senator Agnes Zani and MPs Tom Kajwang (Ruaraka) and Simba Arati (Dagoretti North).The ODM rally will be a culmination of a series of events organised by the party in Nairobi to celebrate its 10 years anniversary and also energise Raila s 2017 presidential election bid.The rally comes hot on the heels of a similar one led by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho at the Coast last Saturday.Zani said a caravan from Kawangware, Kibra, Kariakor, Mlango Kubwa, Eastleigh, Dandora and Masinde Muliro will mark the procession for the grand event. A letter by Kariuki to the police shows he has booked the venue for civic education on development programmes.
