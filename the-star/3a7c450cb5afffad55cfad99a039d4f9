The roof-top solar carport of the recently launched Garden City Mall will cut carbon emissions from power generation through non-renewable energy by 745 tonnes annually.This is according to the Solarcentury and Solar Africa renewable energy organisations that collaborated in the construction of the installation.The project that was announced on September 18, 2014, was launched Tuesday with a total 3,300 solar panels used that are capable of generating 1256 MWh annually.&ldquo;We are incredibly proud to be bringing our second dual-mode solar system to Kenya, this time to build East Africa&rsquo;s largest rooftop system,&rdquo; Dr Dan Davies, the Director for Solarcentury in East Africa said in 2014 during the commissioning of the project.The project, Africa&rsquo;s largest, is situated on the uppermost storey of car park at the mall as part of the integrated residential, retail, hotel and office development along the Thika Superhighway.Besides providing shade for cars, the dual-mode technology used in the project, will provide solar energy in the daytime to reduce consumption from the power grid.In the event of a power outage, the system reduces the consumption of costly diesel backup through generators making the dual functionality of the system highly efficient.
