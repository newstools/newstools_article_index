Graduates from UoN, Kenyatta and Moi universities have the highest chances of being employed, a British Council report reveals.The Universities Employability, and Inclusive Development Survey shows 25.6 per cent of University of Nairobi students, 19 per cent from Kenyatta University, 10.3 per cent from Moi University and 8.6 per cent from KCA are likely to be absorbed in the job market. Less than five per cent would be from Maseno, Catholic, JKUAT, Egerton and Masinde Muliro universities. The three universities are perceived to provide more graduates to the job market, and may have some historical prestige, Tristan McCowan from the Institute of Education, University College London, said.The report also showed that more than half of university graduates believe they cannot be employed despite having a degree. Less than 20 per cent of those interviewed attributed this to the economic climate, their university not being well regarded by employers, the shrinking number of jobs, and their degrees being too general or too specialised.Thirty-four per cent of the graduates questioned said they are able to get a job because they do not have social networks, while another 34 per cent cited lack of family connections. It is about who you know that will get you employed. Without networks, students said they were certain they cannot be employed, McCowan said. The report showed 65 per cent of students said they want to be self-employed because of the dwindling prospects in the job market . They said self-employment is a better alternative to formal employment because of the qualifications required. Universities are not preparing students for this reality, Ibrahim Oanda from the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa said.
