So what prompted Lamu Governor Issa Timamy (pictured) to make a U-turn after he had warmed up to and gone to bed with the newly launched Jubilee Party which paraded him as a celebrated defector? A little bird chirps to Corridors that the soft-spoken governor may have received intelligence that he may not be JP s favourite after all. It is said the party operatives are shopping for a different candidate, which has not gone down well with Timamy. And now he has embraced ANC.*********A governor from North Rift is uneasy and anxious. Reason? Corridors has been told the county boss who does not like publicity is now a latter-day King Solomon. He is said to be on a shopping spree for beautiful young widows. A mole in the county tells Corridors the governor has committed to help the ladies financially to provide warmth during cold seasons . Members of the public have laid a trap to catch him. ********Still with matters to do with governors, a county boss from Eastern is said to have directed his Accounts department to give his mother-in-law a monthly shopping allowance of Sh1 million. MCAs tell Corridors the allowance was given to the middle-aged woman so she could shop for expensive clothes and buy organic food to keep her young-looking and attractive. That way she won t embarrass the governor and his family. The woman is now said to be making monthly trips to Dubai and once in a while to Italy to collect the best of the best attire and jewellery. But is she eating healthy organic food and staying fit and trim?********With February just a few months away and the IEBC having already published campaign finance regulations, the two main political camps are working day and night to see how they can spend lots of money before the monitoring starts. It is burning a hole in their pockets. Our moles say President Uhuru Kenyatta s camp, which is receiving offers of funding from in and out of the country, is the most stressed about all those resources need to be spent fast. Some Asian companies are said to have opened their purses, hoping their generosity will help them secure lucrative contracts. How to spend the money before the monitoring starts is the biggest headache, according to insiders. In Raila Odinga s camp, money is said to be coming mostly from internal donors but they are dictating how it is to be used. But here too, the headache is how to use it without raising eyebrows.
