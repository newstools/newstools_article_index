Boda boda operators have revived their association and nominated businessman Ismail Khalif as patron. The Kenya Bodaboda Association formed a year ago to safeguard the welfare of its members and boost their earnings has been dormant, according to most of its members.Khalif said the revamped association, comprising 25 saccos, will address issues affecting bodaboda operators in the city. Speaking at the Lunar Park in Nairobi on Tuesday, he said the new lobby group will protect the riders from harassment by county officials. He was with chairmen of saccos affiliated to the association."In the past, my members have been operating with nobody to defend them against abuses from authorities like askaris of the Nairobi county government. But from today we are here to defend them and ensure that they make a decent income from their business and their profession is respected," Khalif said.
