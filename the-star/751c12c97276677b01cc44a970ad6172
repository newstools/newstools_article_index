Kilome MP Regina Ndambuki has dared Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to call for a by-election to replace her following her defection to Jubilee. Ndambuki yesterday accused Kalonzo and Wiper of frustrating her and expressed confidence in defeating any one the party will sponsor. She said Kalonzo and his party have mistreated her since 2013 when she defeated 17 other aspirants. I challenge him (Kalonzo) to call for the mini-polls. He will know he is not fighting me but the people of Kilome. They have been asking why he has been fighting me, and are ready to revenge, she said. Kalonzo started fighting me after the Makueni senatorial by-elections. He accused me of not supporting Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior. They later removed me from the Administration and National Security and the Broadcast and Library parliamentary committees. She challenged the former Vice President to visit Kilome where she said residents are waiting to ask him why he has discriminated against them and sabotaged their MP.Ndambuki and nominated MP Robert Mutemi were nearly beaten up by Wiper supporters after they were accused of being Jubilee moles and kicked out of the party s retreat in Maanzoni Lodge, Machakos county, in September last year. Ndambuki said the incident angered her electorate, and elders have demanded an explanation from Kalonzo. He has put Wiper rebels on notice, warning the party will expel them. This will result in by-elections.Five MPs have left the party. They are John Munuve (Mwingi North), Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central), Richard Makenga (Kaiti) Francis Mwangangi (Yatta) and Ndambuki. Wiper executive director Jared Siso yesterday said the disciplinary committee will summon the five to show cause why they should not be expelled.
