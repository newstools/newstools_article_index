Nyando MP Fred Outa will spend a night in police cells for allegedly inciting Ahero Girls' Secondary School students to protest.The MP was arrested on Tuesday for demanding that their interdicted principal, Sarah Adipo, be brought back, leading to demonstrations.Assistant IG Joseph Keitany said the MP was addressing the students when he was ejected by Ahero police station officers."He was told to go to the station to record a statement but instead he went to the market and mobilised the youth to cause chaos," he said.Outa was later arraigned before Kisumu senior resident magistrate Julius Ngarngar.The prosecution applied for his detention for three days amid investigations but the magistrate said a ruling will be delivered on Wednesday.Adipo was interdicted by the Teachers Service Commission over alleged misappropriation of school funds.She was replaced in acting capacity by deputy principal Stellah Wang ala. The protests, during which the students damaged property, saw the institution closed and the learners sent home.The Nyando security team led by deputy county commissioner Fredrick Runalo was called in to contain the situation.Runalo said the students went on the rampage from 6pm to about 11pm on Monday. He said the protests resumed on Tuesday morning. He said the school was closed for calm to be restored.
