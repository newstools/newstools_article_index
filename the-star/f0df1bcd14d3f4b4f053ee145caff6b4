Two MPs from Murang'a county have given the government conditions it must fulfill before proceeding with the construction of the controversial water tunnel.MPs Irungu Kangata (Kiharu) and Tirus Ngahu (Kangema) told journalists at Parliament Buildings that the state should plant more trees at Aberdare Forest.They also asked the government to ensure all households in the area are served with clean piped water as well as share "obstruction fee" with the county government.The MPs who appeared undecided on whether the state should proceed with the project, said the set conditions will reduce any unforeseen negative impact of the venture.The government has started implementing the Sh6.8 billion project funded by the World Bank, which entails building an 11.8km tunnel to supply water to Ndakaini dam."For the project to gain legitimacy, my main issue in this debate is that the people of Kiharu and the entire county of Murang'a should get water," Kangata said."The bone of contention was that residents of the county were not going to get water," he said.Ngahu said: "The horse has bolted but what we want to see is to ensure that the agreements reached with the locals and leaders are adhered to," The two leaders said the initial idea of building a dam was conceived by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and then Water minister Charity Ngilu. They said they opposed the construction of the dam as it was not far from Ndakaini, which is already supplying water to Nairobi county.The two said that it was the Jubilee administration that came up with the idea of building the Sh6.8 billion water tunnel.Read: Murang'a residents want area MPs to break silence on 'secret' water projectAlso read: Waiguru hits at Raila for opposing Sh6.8bn Murang'a water project NEMA DID NOT APPROVE PROJECT Cord senators James Orengo (Siaya) and Johnson Muthama (Machakos) earlier told the press that the project should be stopped.They asked the World Bank to pull out of the initiative until all the fears are addressed, adding that the same was not approved by the Nema. "Despite these clear laws, regulations and polices, the Athi Water Services Board proceeded to design the project and the World Bank proceeded to approve the funding before even the terms of reference by Nema had been approved," the leaders said in a joint statement. "Nema license for the project was not issued until February 2015, which is more than one year after the project was designed; and about six months after the contractor had commissioned the project," they added. They claimed some politicians in Jubilee who have investments in Ruiru secretly want to use the Northern Collector Tunnel for their personal gain.
