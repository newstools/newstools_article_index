Murang a GK Prison ran on lanterns and torches for three days until Monday night after Kenya Power cut off supply over Sh500,000 arrears.Wardens say they were more vigilant and those off duty have been recalled. The prison holds about 620 inmates - 550 men and 70 women. Wardens expressed fears inmates would try to break out. We would have had such a hard time if the prisoners decided to take advantage of the darkness to plot an escape, a warden said.He said the administration liaised with the Kenya Prisons Service to have the power restored.Power supply was also cut off from the wardens quarters. Some families said they have applied for individual power connections because of the frequent power cuts. It is unfair that we have been forced to start paying for our water and power bills, yet the government is supposed to pay for it since there is an allocation, a family member said.A prison official said the disconnection was caused by delays by the Treasury to release funds.The majority of prisons countrywide have experienced disconnections, he said.Murang a Prison officer in-charge Billy Koshial said operations have now been normalised.Last October, electricity was disconnected over Sh550,000 arrears.
