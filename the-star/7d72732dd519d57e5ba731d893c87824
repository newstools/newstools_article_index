Tiaty MP Asman Kamama has renewed calls for Cord to rescind plans to acquire a parallel tallying poll system for its presidential candidate in the 2017 election.Kamama, who said the initiative will cause chaos, wants the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to take charge."If their plans succeed, we may end up announcing two presidents. This will be a recipe for confusion," warned Kamama who is a member of President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party."No election in the world is administered by more than one referee. In this case, the referee is the IEBC."But ODM political affairs secretary Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja MP) told Kamama to stop panicking."They have no idea what our strategy is," he said. "The least Jubilee should do is to ensure the elections are free and transparent and that the will of the majority is respected. The consequences of rigging will be too grave to contemplate."It is expected that Cord leader Raila Odinga, who has a huge support base in six of the eight regions in the country, will run for the presidency for the fourth time.A section of Cord MPs, who did not want to go on record, said the system will collect, transmit and tally presidential votes from polling centers across the country.The results will be matched with what is announced by the IEBC through the national tallying system.Cord is planning to send a team of experts to Germany to oversee the acquisition of the poll system as part of preparations for the August 8 general election.The move by Cord is a case of lessons from the past; the coalition claimed the 2007 and 2013 presidential elections were rigged to the its disadvantage.Raila has often accused the electoral commission of colluding with Jubilee to rig last year's poll and has complained that the commission is ill-prepared for next year.But Uhuru's communication team blasted him in January saying the Jubilee Administration was steadily transforming Kenya as Kenyans want strong, principled, national political movements.More on this: Jubilee blasts Raila over rigging allegations, statement heaps scorn on Cord leadersIn August, the opposition leader gave an account of how the 2013 general election was allegedly rigged, saying commissioners called him and made a confession.The Cord leader further said anomalies were noticed in records the electoral commission submitted following a court order.[VIDEO] Raila reveals IEBC confession of rigging in 2013 electionRead: How 2013 elections were rigged in favour of Uhuru, claims RailaRaila has been quoted in public rallies assuring his supporters that he will not complain again of a rigged election but he challenged them to register in large numbers."Vote and leave everything to me," he has said on many occasions.
