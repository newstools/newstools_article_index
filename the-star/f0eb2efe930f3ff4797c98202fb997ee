A new study suggests that nearly half of Kenyan mothers deliver their children in facilities that could be as dangerous as giving birth at home without skilled help.It calls into question recent efforts to encourage women to deliver in dispensaries and rural health centres saying they are poorly staffed. The study by Harvard University's Chan School of Public Health argues that this may not necessarily save lives because many of those facilitates cannot handle complications. Our findings suggest that the current strategy of birth at any clinic is likely wrong, and that poor quality is undermining the goal of reducing maternal and newborn mortality around the world, said Margaret Kruk, associate professor of global health at Harvard Chan School and lead author of the study.The researchers said they only analysed data from health system surveys funded by USAID from Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda because these countries have high maternal mortality.They said that 40 per cent of births are taking place in poor-quality facilities with crucial deficiencies in staffing, infrastructure, referral systems, and routine and emergency care practices.The study, Quality of basic maternal care functions in health facilities of five African countries , was published on Friday in Lancet Global Health.The research does take note that most births in health centres initially took places in remote villages where many women died of complications. The free maternity programme in Kenya has been largely successful and latest data shows it has actually reduced maternal mortality.Head of Policy, Planning and Healthcare Financing at the Ministry of Health Dr Peter Kimuu says within the first year of its launch, deliveries in public health facilities had increased from 418,325 to 627,487.This increase translated to 61 per cent of total deliveries, in Kenya, being done in public institutions.The ministry says delivery in health facilities saves the lives of more than 2,000 mothers every year in addition to saving the lives of 30,000 children under-five, every year.In the Harvard study, researchers measured the quality of basic maternal care functions at 1,715 health care facilities using an index of 12 indicators, including the availability of skilled providers, a functional ambulance, electricity, clean water, and antibiotics. They also looked at whether quality was linked to volume of births per year or to a facility s capacity to perform cesareans.They found that nearly 90 per cent of the facilities studied did not have the capacity to perform cesarean sections, and that those clinics delivered 44 per cent of all babies born in a health care facility. Small primary care clinics scored, on average, only 3.8 out of 10 on a basic index of quality; facilities with surgical capability had nearly double this score. As we have already done in wealthy countries, we need to get women in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and in other countries with high rates of maternal and neonatal mortality, into larger, better health care facilities to deliver their babies, said Kruk. Governments in lower-income countries and their global partners need to urgently pivot from promoting access alone to improving quality of care for childbirth.
