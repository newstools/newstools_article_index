Pan African lender Ecobank says the law capping interest rates will push Kenya's interest spreads from the highest in Africa to among the lowest.The regional bank, which has operations in 36 countries, most of them in Africa said yesterday Kenya has the highest interest spread in the continent at between 11 and 12 per cent, while Nigeria - the biggest economy in Africa had the lowest at six per cent. Interest spread is the difference between what banks charge for loans and what they pay for deposits."Kenya's interest spread will now drop to reach the region of Nigeria. The Francophone zone of West Africa has the lowest rates because of currency pegs and low inflation," said Ecobank's head of financial research desk George Bodo.Kenya, which earned the bank one of the highest returns on investments, is also expected to witness lower earnings in the banking sector as of end of first half next year, Ecobank analysts said.Return on investment in Kenya was high with at least 20 per cent, the bank said, but will halve by quarter two next year due to lower profits brought on by the new interest capping law whose implementation started last week.The new law caps maximum interest rate on loans at 14.5 per cent and increases the rate paid on deposits to at least 7.35 per cent.Last week, Central Bank deputy governor Sheila M Mbijiwe hinted the moratorium on new bank licensing was put in place to protect local banks from new entrants, given that their spreads are too high to weather competition from lenders of other African states and from the Middle East.Citing South Africa s at 3.3 per cent, Mauritius at 2.8 per cent, and Malaysia s at 1.5 per cent, she told the industry to work on modalities to lower the spreads to about five per cent.With maximum cost of borrowing at 14.5 per cent and interest on savings accounts at 7.35 per cent under the amended banking law all factors remaining constant the spreads are roughly at 7.15 per cent. One of the things that strike me when I look at that (interest spread) is that with a lot of interest in Kenyan space, are our banks going to be able to compete favourably with the newcomers ... or do we do something quickly to make ourselves competitive and hold the advantage we have? she asked delegates attending the annual Kenya Bankers' Association conference on September 8.
