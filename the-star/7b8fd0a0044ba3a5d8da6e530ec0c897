The government has expressed concern over the shortage of skills among students. ICT Permanent Secretary Victor Kyalo yesterday said this has mainly been caused by the theoretical nature of the education provided in tertiary institutions.He said this is not adequate for graduates to find jobs in a rather practical-oriented job market. Kyalo spoke during the graduation at the Samsung Electronics Engineering Academy. He called for the revival of the Merge Trainee Programme that was once provided by public companies to equip graduates with required skills. Companies should embrace the programme. It was offered by Kenya Telecom, KPLC and the Postal Corporation. It assisted students to gain practical skills, Kyalo said.
