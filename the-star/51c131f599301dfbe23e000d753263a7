The 2014 event was a success and we hope to pick from where we left off in the the last edition, said the official.He added: For now we haven t settled on the six teams but we should be able to give out the names in two weeks time. At the same, Nairobi Water women s handball team have intensified training at the Nyayo Stadium ahead of the 37th African Women s Handball Champions League between October 20-27 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.The team led by Jack Ochieng failed to get past the group stages last year in Morocco and the tactician believes his side has come of age since. We have become regulars in this event. We have gained much exposure and experience to challenge our opponents. Meanwhile the KHF national league takes a break this weekend to pave way for the ongoing Kenya University Sports Association (KUSA) games.
