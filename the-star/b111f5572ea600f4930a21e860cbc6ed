Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago on Tuesday asked NCIC chairman Francis Kaparo to resign and join politics.He asked the cohesion commission boss to stop prosecuting people in the media before hearing their story."If Kaparo wants to join politics, let him resign but if he wants to remain as the chairman of this commission, he should follow due process," an agitated Mandago said after a 3-hour grilling at the NCIC offices.Mandago said his statement on Laban Ayiro's appointment as Moi University VC was qouted out of context by the media. "And I want to be very categorical about this, those things that were reported particularly by NTV that we don't want Ayiro because he's an outsider were not true," the governor said.

"What I have given you is enough, I don't want you to go and write things I didn't say," said Mandago.The probe was conducted by the NCIC legal team in the absence of Kaparo who was said to be away. The governor's associated intimated to the media that the governor is planning to sue NTV for defamation.Read: Mandago, Tolgos grilled for 3 hours over inciteful remarks
