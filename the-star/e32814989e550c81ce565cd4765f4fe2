Doctors in Nairobi have issued a fresh strike notice, citing failure by the county government to honour its pledges. Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union secretary general Nairobi branch Thuranira Kaugiria said only one of the five issues they raised has been addressed. We have given them until Friday to address the issues. If they fail, on Saturday we will be off duty again. Strike is the only language this county seems to understand best, he said. Kaugiria said the county has only effected a six month salary agreement, but the remaining demands, including issuance of confirmation letters, promotions and remittance of statutory deductions, have not been addressed. The doctors called off their three-week strike on September 30 after signing a return-to-work formula with the county government. The county agreed to address all grievances raised by the doctors by last Friday.
