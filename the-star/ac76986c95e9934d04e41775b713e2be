A resident of Suba South constituency has petitioned the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate the provision of boreholes by the Homa Bay government.In a letter dated October 17, Gerald Dibogo through the law firm Ahmednassir, Abdikadir and Company Advocates claims the boreholes were sunk in the homesteads of a county official, an MP and an MCA."This constitutes utter impunity and improper use of public funds, not to mention ultimately denying residents of Suba constituency the much needed public utilities," lawyer Martin Tebino said.He said the three colluded to divert the boreholes."It is quite unfortunate that our leaders do not appreciate that we are under a new constitutional dispensation, where all public officers are under a duty not only to uphold the provisions of the constitution but also conduct themselves in an ethical manner while serving the electorate," he said.
