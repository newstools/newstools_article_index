DPP Keriako Tobiko has refuted claims that he is yet to make a decision on the ChickenGate scandal involving top election officials.His office issued a statement on Wednesday in response to a story in the media which said he had been slow in making decisions on the Sh52 million scandal.Beatrice Omari, senior assistant director of public communication, said the files were received on July 19 from the EACC and reviewed, but that more information was sought.Part of the expected additional information, Omari said, was evidence obtained by the UK's Serious Fraud Office.She added that statements from the persons who handled Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) requests are also needed.Omari said the DPP will only make a final decision after getting all the information he asked the EACC for."On September 5, a joint meeting between the ODPP and EACC was held to discuss the identified issues. The anti-corruption team is addressing the issues so the DPP can take conclusive action," the agency said.More on this: EACC dishonest in Chickengate probe, using me as scapegoat - OswagoAlso read: Chickengate Trivialises Mega-Corruption ScamsKenya recovered Sh52 million from the scandal involving election and examination officials who were bribed by UK-based printing firm Smith and Ouzman.The British firm is said to have paid the officials to be awarded several contracts worth billions of shillings, for the printing of ballot papers and examinations material.Read: Isaack Hassan cleared as EACC wants Oswago, three others charged in Chickengate scandal
