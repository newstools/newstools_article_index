One thing that emerged from yesterday s State House Summit on Health is that while public hospitals have received state of the art equipment, medical staff remain neglected.While the Ministry of Health had a lot to say about newly acquired cancer machines, doctors, nurses and clinical officers narrated experiences at the hands of authorities that do not seem to care.Doctors arrive at a station willing and ready to serve but are disillusioned two years later when their salaries are delayed by several months and governors, who now oversee health management in the counties, are dismissive of their grievances.This has resulted in many strikes to demand better pay and working conditions. There is a strike currently going on at the Kakamega Hospital and, instead of listening to their grievances, the county government has declared the staff sacked and ordered them to reapply for their jobs.As much as it is important to have hospitals well-equiped, personnel remuneration, training and development are crucial.
