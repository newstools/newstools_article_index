Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has formed a special task force to fast-track reforms in all hospitals and health centres across the county .Mutua said the task force is expected to hand in its findings and recommendations within two weeks. My commitment is to ensure Machakos remains the best county in offering quality healthcare, Mutua said.He said the renovation of facilities in all health centres in the county were ongoing to ensure service delivery was at its best. I have ordered that no patient should share a bed with another in any hospital. That is the directive because we have enough beds and linen in these health facilities, Mutua said.He said quality healthcare was a right to everyone in Machakos and not a privilege. I want the level of healthcare to be of international standards, with the patient coming first, he said.He said working and living conditions of health personnel are being improved to motivate them.Mutua added that demands by doctors had been met and were part of the reforms that were being implemented to enhance service delivery in all hospitals .He said adequate drugs and other essential commodities had been bought for all health facilities adding that no patient should be forced to buy drugs from private chemists. Led by Kenya Medical Practitioners, Dentist and Pharmacists Union officials, doctors from Machakos Level 5 Hospital in July complained of harassment and intimidation by Mutua.They also raised concerns about their working conditions and went to his office to present a petition on the same. There is no CT scan in the Hospital, the governor has just painted the hospital white forgetting that doctors are not magicians to work without basic tools, Union chairman Harvey Mbithi said.
