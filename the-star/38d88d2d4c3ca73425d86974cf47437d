The talk of the formation of a giant Cord Party has become a matter of national discourse.Granted, there have been discussions around the issue, but the character of the proposals under discussion are different from what the media is portraying.What is under consideration is not a Cord Party: We are discussing something akin to the Narc model of 2002, not the Jubilee Party model of 2016. We are discussing how the Cord constituent parties can fly their own flags but retain the same Cord identity. We don t want to see Cord affiliate parties facing off at the general election, as was the case in 2013.In other words, the idea is for Cord to faceoff with Jubilee at the 2017 elections, literally. This is critical because the only better way for Cord to approach the 2017 poll is through a bigger, and more purposive, coalition, the same way Narc was in 2002.To achieve this we must consider going for joint nominations among all the affiliates, not necessarily forming one bigger party.Joint nominations will avoid intra-coalition competition, the kind we went through in 2013 with disastrous consequences. The outcome of the elections had huge implications for Cord s strength in the Eleventh Parliament. Using Makadara constituency, for example, the TNA candidate beat ODM's George Aladwa by a paltry 1,600 votes to clinch the seat. In the same contest, both Wiper and Ford Kenya had candidates whose combined vote count was as high as 10,000 votes. Almost needless to say, assuming that Cord had fielded one candidate in Makadara there is no doubt whose seat it would be today.An analysis by ODM of a similar situation arising from the 2013 elections reveals that our party lost up to 40 parliamentary seats because of intra-coalition competition.It is because of this that the coalition is seriously weighing the issue with the hope that, if properly leveraged, we may as well field one coalition candidate against Jubilee and do away with the tyranny of numbers myth.The idea of joint nominations stands to strengthen the coalition through increased numbers in both Houses of Parliament. Through it we shall give the small parties the freedom to identify with Cord and exploit their support base to the maximum.A coalition that fights itself through its constituent parties will not achieve its objectives.
