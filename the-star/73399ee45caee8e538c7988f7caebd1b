Gor Mahia s Italian fitness trainer Sandro Fantoni has been suspended for one match by the league s Independent Disciplinary and Complaints Committee after he was found guilty of poor conduct.The committee has further asked Fantoni to review his temper and reactions, warning that they will respond very harshly if he is involved in another case of misconduct this season. Fantoni will serve a further period of exclusion for one match being the immediate next Gor Mahia match following this decision. For that match, Fantoni shall not be allowed within any area of the applicable stadium. Fantoni is further put on notice to review his actions/reactions and that any reference to this committee for misconduct within this season if proved shall attract stiffer penalties, the IDCC ruling on the KPL official site read. The charges of bad behaviour had been brought before the disciplinary committee by the Kenyan Premier League.The league complained that on September 5, Fantoni made obscene gestures at the referee by using both hands in full glare of TV cameras after being ordered to move away from the area behind the opponent s goal. The Gor trainer will thus miss their next league match on Sunday against Sofapaka at Nyayo Stadium.At the hearing, KPL argued that Fantoni was a repeat offender whose conduct could lead to the provocation of Gor Mahia fans. The league body revealed that Fantoni had been officially warned about unbecoming conduct after using abusive language at match officials and stripping half naked thereby causing excitement amongst the club s fans.In his defence, Fantoni stated that he was deeply passionate about football, and that his actions were not meant to evoke any negative actions. He said his gesture of pointing both index fingers to the sky was very Italian and innocent, and certainly not meant to slight the match officials.IDCC agreed that the gesture might have been innocent, but that his actions of engaging the opponent s goalkeeper and the referee in verbal exchanges were disruptive.
