Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi was questioned yesterday over why the county illegally spent public money before the assembly passed a law governing county finances.He was also questioned on why there was no public participation in budget-making. The budget was passed without public participation. It is not only illegal but also an act of fraud to draw public funds without express authority anchored in law to incur that expenditure, Nyamira Senator Kennedy Mong are said.Cheboi had appeared before the Senate Public Accounts Committee to respond to audit queries for 2013-14.The county spent the 2013-14 budget before the Public Finance Management Act was enacted by the assembly because there were no supportive structures during the transition period that would facilitate and fast-track the legislation, he said. We consulted opinion leaders and members of the county assembly in the informal kamukunji meeting while preparing the budget, Cheboi told the committee led by vice chairman John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot).He said the county was able to prepare PFM Acts in 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. During the transition period, the Transition Authority staff were not even accountable to us. But we have subsequently regularised the issues, he said.The governor was also taken to task why his government hired office space from the Agricultural Finance Cooperation at a monthly rent of Sh250,000, and still incurred utility bills despite paying another Sh25,000 service charge per month.
