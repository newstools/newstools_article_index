Three senior Embu officials sacked a month ago led 9,000 residents of Kyeni North and Kyeni South in endorsing Embu Senator Lenny Kivuti for governor on Saturday. Joshua Kanake, Prof Joe Kamari and Bosco Kiura visited Kivuti at his Kanyuambora residence in Mbeere North subcounty. Kyeni people, because you have decided to support Kivuti for governor, we are together. The swahili people say dark clouds signify the coming of rains, Kanake said.
