Donald Trump has made a bold statement against Hillary Clinton, calling her a "bigot" who's only out for votes. Speaking at a rally at Jackson, Miss., on Wednesday night, Trump accused Clinton of taking for granted her minority voters. "Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future," Trump said, drawing loud cheers from the crowd. The statement has already been met with cries of irony on social media. Trump has been accused of racism himself and Clinton, speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night shortly after Trump made the statement, said, "Someone who's questioned the citizenship of the first African-American president ... is someone who is very much peddling bigotry and prejudice and paranoia." It's the latest attack on Clinton as Trump revs up his campaign. Earlier on Wednesday, during a rally in Tampa, Fla., he said Clinton's supporters are mostly celebrities who "aren't very hot anymore." "Her supporters have very little enthusiasm," he said.At the Jackson rally, Trump also invited outing UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage -- noted for being a major architect of Brexit -- on the stage, according to multiple reports.
