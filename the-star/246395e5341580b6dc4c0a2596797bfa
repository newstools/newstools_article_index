Confederation of African Volleyball women s under-23 Championships earlier set for October 18-28 has been pushed back. The event will now take place on October 23-27 at the Safaricom Indoor Arena, Kasarani.Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) secretary general, Ben Juma, said the changes were made by CAVB to pave way for another event in Cairo next month. The changes have been made by CAVB and since we are the host nation, we have no choice but to abide by that, observed Juma.\The event, according to officials, has attracted six nations including hosts Kenya, Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, Botswana and Rwanda, who are yet to confirm officially.The event will serve as a qualification for the FIVB U-23 World Championships set for next year in Ljubljana and Maribo in Slovenia. We have sent the letters rescheduling the dates to all the nations. I know Tunisia, Egypt, Botswana, Senegal and Kenya are sure bets for the event but for Rwanda, we will have to wait and see, said Juma.He added: In the first letter that was send to us by CAVB, two teams were to qualify for the World Championship if the number of teams taking part in the event were more than eight but only one is to qualify if less teams turned up for the event. And now that only six will feature in the event, only one team will book the sole ticket to the global event. At the same time, the national U23 women s team have intensified training at the Safaricom Indoor arena. The team, under the tutelage of former national team player Catherine Mabwi, Kenya Prisons women s team assistant coach Jos Barasa and KCB head coach has intensified training as the players seek to make the final cut of 12 players ahead of the event. Currently, 17 players are in the non-residential training and the technical bench is set to trim the squad down to 12 players in the coming weeks.
