The refugee crisis in Kenya and other countries will be discussed during the first ever UN Summit on Refugees and Migrants which started yesterday in New York.The summit comes months after Kenya announced her plans to close the Dadaab camp by November 30.Deputy President William Ruto, who has several times blamed the camp as a centre for recruitment, radicalisation, training and planning for terrorist attacks by al Shabaab, is leading a high-powered delegation.The spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Melissa Fleming, yesterday said the summit will be a game changer for people on the move in the world. It is not for few countries to shoulder responsibility; other countries should do much more, she said in a video posted on the UNHCR's official website, signalling a clash likely to occur in the summit over failure by rich countries to help developing ones.Kenya made the decision to repatriate refugees in November 2013, when Kenya, Somalia and UNHCR signed a Tripartite Agreement setting grounds for the repatriation.The agreement later degenerated into blame game that parties involved were dragging their feet.Fleming said richer countries have to provide much more reliable funding that is timely. If countries hosting refugees feel more supported then be able to offer opportunities for refugees to work and commit to have every refugee child in school, she said.The Kenyan government says the country has hosted more than 600,000 for more than 25 years, with littles support from the international community.And in May, the government said it will not backtrack on its resolve to close the Dadaab camp and repatriate refugees.More than 300,000 refugees, mostly from Somalia are hosted in Dadaab. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery said Kenya can no longer bear the security burden of hosting more than half a million Somali refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had warned Kenya over its decision to stop hosting refugees.UNHCR said the safety of hundreds of thousands of Somalis, South Sudanese and other refugees living in Kenya hinged on the country s generosity and its willingness to be a leading beacon in the region for international protection. The agency said it was important that international asylum obligations prevail and are properly supported for 600,000 refugees in Kenya, just like 60 million refugees hosted globally.
