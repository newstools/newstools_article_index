Kanu secretary general Nick Salat has denied claims he has joined Cord. He said he only joined the opposition in the push for the removal of the commissioners of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission from office.Salat spoke during the burial of Leonard Korir, the husband of Singorwet MCA Joyce Korir, in Aisaik, Bomet Central, last week. I only took part in the protests because reformation of the poll body was in the best interest of the Kenyan people. I m now a happy man because our fight was rewarded and the poll agency leadership has decided to go home, he said.Salat said he is still in Kanu and his association with the opposition does not mean that the Independence party is ready for a merger with Cord. What Kanu has been pushing for is the restructuring of the commission through the Inter-Party Parliamentary Group formula of 1997, where political parties nominated representatives to the commission, he said.Eagerly awaitedSalat also supported calls for a fresh audit of the voters register before the next general election to prevent rigging. The funeral was alto attended by Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso.He said the country eagerly awaits the new IEBC team to conduct the next year s general election.
