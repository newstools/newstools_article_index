Alego Usonga MP George Muluan has told off Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) for implying that Cord leader Raila Odinga should shelve his presidential bid.The Cord co-principals have asked Raila support them in the 2017 general elections.Muluan, elected on a Wiper ticket, admitted that Raila has been working very hard to popularise Cord as a coalition across the country.The MP complained that it is not fair for the two co-principals to propose that Raila should step down for them.He said this is owing to the latter's visible efforts to deliberate the country from the repression of poor leadership."It is high time the coalition had unity of purpose. I urge all members to put efforts in wooing supporters towards the common goal of defeating Jubilee in 2017," Muluan said.He said it was regretful that instead of Kalonzo and Wetang'ula supporting Raila s course to woo voters, they have resorted to politics that border on personal interest of being Cord flag bearers. The legislator disclosed that no single party has succeeded in forming a government in the past general elections, further Cord affiliated parties to unite.Muluan made the remarks when he addressed his constituents at Mwer Boys secondary school during the official hand over of a classroom funded by Alego/Usonga NCDF.He at the same time asked Nyanza leaders to support Raila s bid for president by campaigning for him in other regions instead of wrangling among them.The legislator further reminded his supporters that he is still a life-member of ODM despite being elected on a Wiper ticket."I was only forced to seek an alternative party during the 2013 general election after losing to secure an ODM ticket. That does not mean am not an ODM member, am still a life-member," Muluan said.His sentiments were echoed by West Alego MCA Peter Muhula, elected on a Ford-Kenya ticket, who said that the three Cord principals must strive to remain united.This comes at a time when there are alleged differences in the coalition over who will be the flagbearer of the coalition.Read: Discord in Cord as Wiper tells ODM to keep off going it alone threatRead: No discord in Cord Ford Kenya bossHowever, Raila has downplayed the insinuations of a split, saying that the coalition will name its flagbearer at the right time.Also read: Raila allies say he will be on the ballot in 2017
