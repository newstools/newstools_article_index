Ten new footbridges will be put up on the busy Thika Superhighway to reduce the number of pedestrians hit by vehicles on the road.Juja MP Francis Waititu said the superhighway has become a "killer highway" as many people are killed on the road.He spoke to the press after a meeting with religious leaders at a Juja hotel.Waititu said he and religious leaders petitioned Parliament to put up more footbridges from the Ruiru River to Thika, and it was approved. We have many institutions of learning like Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenyatta University Ruiru campus, Nairobi Institute of Business Studies, and the population has also increased, thus we need more safer road crossing areas, he said.Waititu added that the government will also construct the Juja overpass to ease traffic jams at the bridge, which has become a nightmare.Residents and leaders have been complaining over the number of people being killed on the busy Thika superhighway and have called for urgent solutions.Thika West deputy county commissioner Tom Anjeretold the press in his office recently that he and some experts from various agencies visited black spot areas in Thika and came up with recommendations to reduce fatalities due to accidents.The experts include the Thika security team, engineers from the Kenya National Highways Authority and a team from the National Transport and Safety Authority. We are going to erect signage at the Taj Mall, Del Monte, Njomoko and Thika Sports Club, where the speed limit is 50KPH. NTSA will enforce the set speed limits, Anjere said.The DCC said they will also close the stage at the Blue Post area, which has been blamed for the many accidents at that black spot.On development, Waititu said every school in Juja has been connected to electricity and thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for it.Every MP has been given five high voltage transformers to be erected in each of the 290 constituencies, he said. The President has given them to the MPs so that they can oversee and ensure they are not stolen and sold in Uganda like we have seen in the past, explained Waititu.At the same time, Waititu gave out bursaries worth Sh5 million to needy students in Juja constituency. In January we gave out bursaries worth Sh15 million, in February we gave out an additional Sh5 million. In total, since I became the area MP, I have issued bursaries worth Sh69 million, he said.
