Did the recent 10th anniversary dinner for ODM life members go wrong? Well, Corridors has learned that despite guests having paid Sh6,000 to dine and wine with party leader Raila Odinga, some of them missed seats because the hall was too small. Some who had travelled from as far away as Meru, Isiolo, Mandera and Mombasa found themselves peeping in from outside the room to catch a glimpse of the event, because some people who had not paid for the celebrations occupied their seats. An attempt by a senior party official to plead with uninvited persons embedded in the ceremony to observe some decorum fell on deaf ears. Members who travelled from far and wide were overhead complaining after the event it was disgustingly unfair that even after paying the Sh6,000 they could not get the space to sit and interact with their party leader. Some even vowed not to attend several other celebrations lined up at the county level.****************Residents of Akila Estate in the city's Eastlands area are a frustrated lot as crime levels continue to surge every other day. Those who have confided in Corridors claim that all manner of criminal activities, from mugging to armed robbery with violence, continue to disrupt their daily activities and their attempts to have the police deal with the matter have yielded zero results as residents continue to be terrorised by lawlessness. Attempts to hold meetings with the police on the best possible solution have not been successful either. Suspected burglars, muggers and others are released immediately they are handed over to the police under the guise that there is no evidence and since this year started, no suspect has been produced in court. Those set free turn on to their perceived 'betrayers'. They now blame one of the senior police officers in the area, saying that his arrogant behaviour will only see the menace escalate. And whether he is 'eating' with the lawbreakers, only time will tell! Meantime, will Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet act speedily on Akila Estate?*************Nairobi county Finance officers are heartily sick and tired with a renowned controversial senior staffer. Reason? A whispering bird tells Corridors the official, angling for a parliamentary seat, has been a nuisance, demanding money through unorthodox means from Finance officers to fund his campaigns. It is said the man has been using his position, privileges and administrative powers to order daily withdrawals of money payable directly to him. The Finance chiefs have threatened to fix him and approach either the County Secretary or their boss, Governor Evans Kidero.***************Just what compelled the angered Deputy Governor to throw papers at the County Secretary? Our mole tells Corridors a deputy governor in one of Kenya's cities threw uncleared payment papers at his county secretary in protest at a delay to approve them for his friend. It remains unclear what the deputy governor's friend was to be paid for, but word has it that the county deputy could, well, be pushing for payment to a 'ghost supplier' - or is part of the nefarious corrupt cartels at the county HQ.
