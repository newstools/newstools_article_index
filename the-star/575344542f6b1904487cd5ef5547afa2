President Uhuru Kenyatta has assured residents that they will be compensated for land taken up by the construction of Phase 2A of the SGR.He asked residents should cooperate with the contractor as the project will create jobs for the youth in all the counties it passes through.&quot;No one should therefore worry about loss of land because we will ensure full compensation is done to anyone who gives up his land,&quot; Uhuru said on Wednesday.He was speaking during the launch at Em-bulbul in Kajiado County. Uhuru said the contractor has also been directed to ensure that at least 40 per cent of all materials are sourced locally. &ldquo;This will not only expand our factories but also create more jobs for our people,&rdquo; he said.He pointed out that phase one of the SGR &ndash; which runs from Mombasa to Nairobi &ndash; has employed 40,000 Kenyans and expressed optimism that its completion will be within schedule in June 2017.Phase 2A of the construction, that will cost Sh150 billion, will take the track from Nairobi to Naivasha, while the entire second phase will go all the way to Malaba via several counties.These include Kajiado, Nakuru, Narok, Bomet, Kericho and Kisumu counties.The President urged the residents of the affected regions not to allow themselves to be incited against the project, saying they should embrace dialogue in addressing issues arising from the construction.&ldquo;It was wrong for some leaders to incite residents to rough up the railway workers,&rdquo; Uhuru said, referring to a recent incident where some Kajiado county residents attempted to disrupt ongoing construction work.Uhuru particularly took issue with conservationists and some politicians saying they should stop inciting people against the project passing through the Nairobi National Park.

Every care has been taken to ensure that there is no environmental degradation and the animals will be taken care of,&rdquo; he said.To complement the SGR, the President said his administration would facilitate development of several industrial parks, including one at Naivasha in Nakuru County and another at Suswa in Narok County.These will cater for light and heavy industries served by the abundant supply of natural steam and the proximity to geothermal electrical power generated in the vicinity.Uhuru said the SGR, which will significantly reduce transport costs, would also promote trade within the region.&ldquo;We have a big opportunity to grow our economy if we shun ethnicity and love each other as Kenyans,&rdquo; he said.Experts&rsquo; projections indicate that, once completed, the SGR will add 1.5 per cent to the country&rsquo;s GDP, while boosting intra-African trade by supporting the tourism industry and reducing the cost of transportation.Kajiado leaders who spoke during the launch assured the President of their support for the railway project.They included Governor David Nkedianye, Senator Peter Ole Mositet and Kajiado North MP David Manje.Other leaders who spoke at the event included Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery, Governors Evans Kidero (Nairobi) and Kinuthia Mbugua (Nakuru), MPs Moses Ole Sekuda (Kajiado West), Peris Tobiko (Kajiado East) and Mary Senator (Kajiado Women Rep).On his way back to Nairobi after the launch, Uhuru made a stopover at Karen shopping centre to acknowledge greetings from residents.He assured that the roads would be rehabilitated to improve the movement of traffic.&nbsp;
