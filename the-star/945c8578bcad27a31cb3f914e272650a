Coast Bottlers CEO and 22 MCAs were arrested by EACC detectives on Monday over bribery claims.Ibrahim Al Khoury and the MCAs were arrested at the company's plant when the latter sought to probe an incident where cotton wool was found water bottled by Coca Cola.A source within the anti-graft body intimated to the Star that the MCAs, who are members of the health committee, were on an inspection tour of the plant- a franchise of Coca Cola company at Kikambala, Kilifi county.The source said that the group wanted to be briefed if the product posed risks to its consumers, where they were allegedly given cash."These people are very corrupt. They were found taking bribe in broad daylight," the source said, adding that the team was grilled at the EACC offices in Mombasa.When contacted, EACC Coast region boss Simon Cherpka said that it was early to issue a statement since the legislators were still being interrogated."Let us give officers enough time to complete their investigations. Once they are done, we will issue a concrete press statement," Cherpka said.Read: Cotton wool found in Dasani water in Mombasa On Thursday, the health committee led by Swaleh Kibwana grilled Al Khoury, following summonses that he appears to shed light on the incident.It is believed that it was then that the committee then resorted to visiting the plant 'as part of their investigations' and were also set to visit the bottler's suppliers.Kenya Bureau of Standards suspended production of Dasani water at the Kikambala plant after a visit by the agency's officers who had received complaints from the MCAs.Regional manager Martin Nyakiamo said the suspension will be in force until surveillance inspectors give the bottler a clean bill of health.The company also recalled the products that were bottled between September 16 and 18.Read: KEBS suspends production of Dasani water at the Coast
