The driver of the lorry ferrying the fuel and his turn boy fled, as did two people suspected to be involved in siphoning.Police seized the fuel on Monday night in Kisian, Kisumu West subcounty. County commissioner Mohammed Maalim said an operation has been launched to destroy the fuel racket. We sent a team which raided the site and recovered a lorry with super petrol and three generator hosepipes, he said. Maalim commended wananchi for working closely with security agents to fight crime. He said 40,000 litres of fuel have been impounded in one week following tip-offs from the public.Last week, police recovered 30,000 litres of diesel and arrested a suspect in Lela. Maalim warned members of the cartel siphoning fuel meant for export that they will be arrested. On Saturday night, two Tanzanian men died of suffocation while siphoning off fuel at the Kisumu Port.The two were crew members of the MV Cock, a Tanzanian vessel whose engine exploded on September 9, as it was about to leave the port. County police commander Titus Yoma said five jerrycans of oil were recovered.
