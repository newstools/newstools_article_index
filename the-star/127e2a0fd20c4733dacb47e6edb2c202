Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula has called for the prosecution of Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet) following demonstrations at Moi University Eldoret.He said the behaviour displayed by the two "is not consistent with the expectations and spirit of the constitution"."We must not allow leaders to incite citizens to violence. This is primitive and barbaric, besides being criminal," he said on Thursday.The Ford Kenya leader said the country was moving towards a mature democratic space and there is no room for retrogressive leadership."We expect the same energy that we saw around Pangani six and Muthaiga two in play. It is clear that these leaders have engaged in criminal activities," he said.Last week on Tuesday, Mandago and Tolgos stormed Moi University in Eldoret to stop newly appointed acting VC Laban Ayiro from taking over. Education CS Fred Matiang'i appointed Ayiro to replace outgoing vice chancellor Richard Mibey whose term ended on Monday.[AUDIO] Two governors, MPs storm Moi University over new 'outsider' VC AyiroMandago and Tolgos said they want professor Isaac Kosgey appointed as he "topped recruitment interviews".But Wetang'ula has encouraged Ayiro discharge his duties without fear.He said Ayiro got his appointment on merit and must serve Moi University to the best of his abilities. "His ability to deliver is not in doubt," the Senator said.He said Ayiro has assumed his responsibilities though a few misguided leaders were making unnecessary and mischievous demands.[VIDEO] Eldoret erupts as CID question Mandago, Tolgos over Moi University protestWetang'ula said the Jubilee administration should admonish and discipline party members who behave in a manner likely to compromise peaceful co-existence."We expect the Jubilee leadership to crack the whip. We also expect Ole Kaparo to move with speed and initiate measures to enhance national cohesion instead of behaving like bystanders" Wetang'ula said.
