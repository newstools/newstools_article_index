Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has said that small parties formed to rival Jubilee and Cord in next year's elections have no future.He said plans by opposition leaders to register Cord as a party to rival Jubilee is good for democracy and national cohesion."Other small parties formed along tribal lines will never stand the test of time," Wamalwa said in Busia on Friday.The CS asked Luhya leaders to emulate his late brother Wamalwa Kijana as well as Masinde Muliro saying that the two died while still supporting national and not tribal causes.Wamalwa was in the county for the signing of deeds of transfer of water and sanitation services to Kakamega and Busia."Muliro was the founder member of KADU which was not a Luhya party and which believed in Majimbo and not tribalism. My brother formed NARC which was also not tribal party," he said."The dissolution of affiliate parties to form Jubilee Party does not mean killing democracy in the country but will unite all Kenyans," the CS added.Read: Jubilee merger plan boosted as nine parties plan official fold-upRead: Jubilee merger not threat to democracy, Uhuru affirms during Narok tourAlso read: CCU not part of Jubilee, chairman Bwanamaka saysBusia governor Sospeter Ojaamong disagreed with Bumula MP Bonface Otysula who urged him to look for votes without supporting ODM leader Raila Odinga.The MP had also claimed that he suffered with Ojaamong in 2005 during the " Banana" and "Orange" supremacy and in 2007 when they suffered unexpected defeat."I will not allow the country to plunge into single party dictatorship the KANU way. I sympathise with you my brother for crossing to Jubilee with catastrophic consequences," Ojaamong told Otysula."Jubilee is now a full house with many people seeking refuge in verandas. Soon, you will find yourself like a lone ranger in the wilderness," the governor said.
