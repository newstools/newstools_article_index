Talks to decide on the send-off package for the commissioners of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission start today (see page 6).These bipartisan discussions should be speedy negotiations that unlock the process of picking new commissioners. The next team of IEBC commissioners have less than a year to prepare for the 12th General Election, and so the clock is ticking.The Judicial Service Commission s nomination of a new Chief Justice last week was a move in the right direction, as far as the timelines of the August 8, 2017, polls are concerned.Every day between now and Election Day must count. The Presidential elections component of the past two general elections had its issues, including two high-tension disputes, one of which went into the streets and became a national crisis and the other into the Supreme Court.Everything should be done and done on time to make the 2017 event Kenya s smoothest, most free and manifestly fair election ever.
