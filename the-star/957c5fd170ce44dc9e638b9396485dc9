Renegade ODM MCA Samwel Nyang'wara has said he will move to court to fight his removal from three Nairobi county assembly committees.Nyang'wara was discharged from three committees shortly after tabling the motion for Governor Evans Kidero's impeachment.He was removed from the Business; Health Services and Trade, Tourism and Cooperatives committees.The MCA said on Wednesday that it was wrong for Cord leaders in the assembly to remove him from all the committees he was in.He said in a television interview that this violated section 14 of the County Government Act, and noted the law requires him in at least one committee."I will go to court and ensure I am in (at least) one committee. I will not allow the law to be violated," he said.Nyang'wara expressed confidence that the impeachment motion will sail through. He said he was sure at least half of ODM MCAs will support it as they will vote by secret ballot."The people against the motion and those making noise are less than 15. These motion will sail through because we have valid reasons to remove Kidero from office," he said.Nyang'wara accused Kidero of violating the constitution, misusing funds and failing to implement development projects.He faced opposition in tabling his motion - during his first attempt last Thursday when MCAs exchanged blows and on Tuesday when ODM ward representatives tried to block him.He eventually tabled the petition which Speaker Alex Magelo committed to the House Business Committee that will allocate it time for debate.More on this: Kidero impeachment motion tabled despite fracas at Nairobi assemblyODM later suspended the MCA for what it termed gross misconduct and violation of the party constitution .Read: ODM suspends MCA for gross misconduct, violating party law after Kidero motion
