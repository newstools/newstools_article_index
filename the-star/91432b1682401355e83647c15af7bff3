Court of Appeal judge Roselyne Nambuye yesterday said she will still walk with her head high, even if she is not selected to fill in the position of Supreme Court judge.She was also interviewed for Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice positions.Making her remarks after appearing before the Judicial Service Commission for the third time, Nambuye said the session helped her clear the air on some issues surrounding her."I am sure I have been absolved by Wanjiku on various issues after appearing before you. I am ready to continue with my duties at the Court of Appeal if I am not successful to fill the Supreme Court judge vacancy," she said.The appellant judge said the interviews have emboldened her and she is not wounded.Nambuye said she is happy to have served the judiciary for the last 38 years, rising to the rank of Court of Appeal judge.She said she has used the position to deliver justice for women and children in family disputes."No child should be destitute after a matrimonial dispute. Widows have a right in the estates of their husbands and my position has enabled me to entrench that using the Constitution," Nambuye said.She said women's rights are being trampled on and organisations such as churches and the civil society should continue educating them on their rightful place in the society under the new Constitution.Nambuye said given a chance to serve as the Supreme Court judge, she would launch a census to remove dead files in the judicial system.The judge, who is currently based in Nyeri, said she has realised that during court sessions some cases are called out but no parties appear."To clear the backlog of cases, removing such files from the system would go a long way in fast-tracking justice," she said. Nambuye, 64, said she pays school fees for destitute children and she will continue doing so in her remaining life in the judiciary. During the DCJ interviews, she said an Election Offence Division should be established to hear cases related to poll violence.Nambuye said since the law is flouted every election year, the division should be used to stop violence and punish perpetrators."With the creation of the division, politicians will fear to incite Kenyans to violence," she said. Nambuye also supported the creation of a Criminal Division Court in the African Union to deal with election violence in Africa.The judge, who is writing a thesis on the International Criminal Court, said the African court will be in a better position to deal with African issues as it understands them.She said since she has worked in far-flung stations in Kenya, she will help the Supreme Court to improve justice in the areas.Nambuye said there has been a big positive change in the judiciary since the new constitution was promulgated in 2010.
