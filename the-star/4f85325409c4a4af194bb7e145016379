Safari Sevens to be taken back to either Nyayo or the RFUEA groundsThe 2018 Safari Sevens will not be staged at the Safaricom Moi Kasarani Centre, Kenya Rugby Union chairman Richard Omwela said yesterday. He said the event will make a return to either the Nyayo Stadium or the RFUEA ground. Omwela said this has been necessitated by the declining attendances and lack of a title sponsor. We are done with Kasarani. We went there because of title sponsor Safaricom but with them not sponsoring this year's event and apathy by fans to the venue have made us rethink logistics. We may have to take it back to Nyayo or Ngong Road, he said. The 2011 and 2012 editions were at Nyayo stadium with an attendance of over 25,000 over three days. The Kasarani stadium recorded a good attendance in 2013 and 2014 with over 20,000 people over the three days. This year's numbers were less than 2000 which means the tournament will make a big loss in terms of revenue. Omwela hinted at poor marketing as a reason for the low numbers experienced this year. We fell short of our advertising budged for the tournament. We targeted Sh60 million but managed Sh55m. So going forward we have learnt our lessons. Next year we hope to have a good event, he added. In the last two years the location of Kasarani has been blamed as a contributing factor to fans staying away. Omwela said they will continue with a pool of sponsors instead of one title sponsor."As a board, we have decided to have many sponsors. When there is a title sponsor, we are always at their mercy. When they pull out we are left holding the can, he explained. He, however, insisted the future of the tournament is not under threat. Should the tournament return to Ngong Road, Omwela said they will need to create extra seating space and logistics to cater for the increased numbers."If we are to go back to the RFUEA Grounds we may have to install more seating capacity and look at logisitics and security he added.
