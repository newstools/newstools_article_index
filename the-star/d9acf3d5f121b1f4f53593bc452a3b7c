Suspended High Court judge Joseph Mutava is set to appeal a tribunal's decision recommending his removal from office.The tribunal unanimously recommended his removal on Wednesday after finding that three of six allegations against him were proven.But Mutava's lawyer Philip Nyachoti told journalists on Thursday that the decision was "ridiculous"."We respect the tribunal's decision but my client has to appeal this decision," he said.Mutava was accused of demanding Sh2.5 million to get a favourable judgment in a land case in Karen.He was also accused of terminating the Sh5.8 billion Goldenberg scandal case against businessman Kamlesh Pattni.Nyachoti said all complaints against his client were withdrawn."It is like using recanted evidence against the accused. We cannot be left hanging... It is unfair. My client will fight and we will not relent," he said.He added: "It is honourable and in our view that the tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to rule on the matter."Read: Mutava urges tribunal to spare his jobAlso read: Tribunal wants judge Joseph Mutava dismissed for misconduct
