Progressive Party of Kenya leader Governor Moses Akaranga has urged two leaders to join his party to avoid the mistreatment they face in ODM .He said PPK is ready to accommodate Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and Karachuonyo MP James Rege. Akaranga said Kidero and Rege should not take ODM s action lightly because they may end up being rigged out in the nominations. I m a man of God and I am not happy seeing hardworking leaders like Kidero and Rege being mistreated in ODM, he said. I invite them to join my party, which has no wrangles. He said plans are underway to popularise PPK countrywide. He said from the look of things, most candidates will be locked out in the nominations. Akaranga said although the party does not have a presidential candidate, he will go round the country to sell its manifesto.
