The state has remitted a negligible percentage of the free primary education funds to Embu schools, the Kenya National Union of Teachers Embu branch has said.The newly elected officials said head teachers are finding it difficult to run the schools and have asked the government to release the funds immediately.Executive secretary Dickson Murunguma said the funds are supposed to be sent when schools are in session, but it seems they might be sent when students are away on holiday.
