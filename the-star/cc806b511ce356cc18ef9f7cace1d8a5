TWO Jubilee MPs, one from the Rift Valley and the other from Central, had a bitter exchange for close to three hours in a certain WhatsApp group on Saturday night. The first-term MP from Central had said that the region would not allow Deputy President William Ruto near the 2017 Jubilee Party campaign kitty. This agitated the first-term MP from the Rift Valley, who, amidst unprintable words, told his colleague that the DP was capable of funding his rivals and ensuring he never sees the inside of Parliament again.***A section of members of a different WhatsApp group formed to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy William Ruto are unhappy that some of their colleagues in the group are actively campaigning for former anti-corruption boss John Harun Mwau for the now-crowded Nairobi governor race. They have demanded to know why some Jubilee supporters are backing the Party of Independent Candidates of Kenya (PICK) leader to unseat Governor Evans Kidero in 2017, yet the President s coalition has several of its top politicians who have already declared they will contest. ******A group of MCAs from a North Rift County protested to the Speaker that they did not visit one of the sites proposed by a museum director during a benchmark tour abroad. In an off-the-cuff conversation, the MCAs said after visiting one of the museums, the directors asked them to visit their website. The MCAs did not know what a website was. They actually believed it is a place you can drive or walk to. The MCAs added the site was part of the tour and it was wrong for the organizers not to include the tour of the website. They wanted the Speaker to intervene so that they can travel abroad again - for the website tour.
