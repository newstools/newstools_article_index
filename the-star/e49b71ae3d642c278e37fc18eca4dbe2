No one will do anything to Kenya at ICC ASP," Murkomen said via Twitter on Tuesday."No one wants Kenya and Africa out of ICC," he added. The tweet elicited mixed reactions from Kenyans, with others attacking the International Criminal Court, while others attacked the Senator."@kipmurkomen it only confirms ICC's desperation and lack of legal tact. [Flogging] a dead horse cannot revive it," James Bett said.Joho wa Mulembe said: "@kipmurkomen silent victory is Justice denied. For God's sake you are the pastors son."."@kipmurkomen so Kenya will still use the pullout blackmail," Sam Kimani said.The court on Monday said ASP would be best placed to address the lack of cooperation to provide an incentive for Kenyan government to cooperate with the court. Noting that the case against Mr Kenyatta has been already terminated and considering the relevance of the materials sought, Trial Chamber considered a referral to the ASP appropriate for the purpose of fostering cooperation more broadly for the sake of any ongoing and/or future investigations and proceedings in the Kenyan situation, the court said.On November 29, 2013, Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda filed an application for a finding of non-cooperation against the Kenyan government. She said it failed to comply with a request to produce records relating to Uhuru, which she claimed were at the heart of her case against him.Bensouda, who dropped Uhuru s case for lack of sufficient evidence, said the government s cooperation drastically changed when Uhuru became President.Read:ICC judges terminate President Uhuru's case
