Jackline&nbsp; Mwende, 27, whose hands were allegedly chopped off by her husband jetted back in the country on Monday after successful surgery in South Korea. Her arms were fitted with electronic limbs, which specialists say she will learn how to use in a span of two months. Mwende flew to South Korea last month to be fitted with the limbs following series of protest over the abuse meted on her.&nbsp; Michael Maru, chief orthopedic surgeon at PCEA Kikuyu hospital who accompanied her, told journalists that the myoelectric prosthetics use a battery and electronic motors. &quot;She is still very weak and needs time to practice how to use her new limbs,&quot; Maru said.&nbsp;Her stumps were fitted with the prosthetics on Friday at the Korea Prosthetics Laboratory.Jackline Mwende holds a boquet of flowers given to her by LG marketing manager Moses Marji at JKIA. /PATRICK VIDIJA&nbsp;&quot;They are custom-made to fit and attach to the stumps with maximum suspension using suction technology,&quot; he said.
