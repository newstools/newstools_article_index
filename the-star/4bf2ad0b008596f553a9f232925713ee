National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has accused the National Treasury and SRC for delaying the recruitment of new IEBC commissioners.Muturi, in a statement on Saturday, said the hiring of new commissioners will only happen when the positions are declared vacant."There need to be a vacancy to necessitate recruitment. That requires resignation of the current occupiers of those offices," Muturi said."But as you will painfully realise again, there is no law requiring their exit, save for the gentleman s agreement with the current holders that they should vacate," he said. Muturi said the National Treasury is yet to make a commitment on the funding the exit package, but noted that the commissioners had voluntarily agreed to quit if they are paid.Read: IEBC commissioners agree to exit but want 'dignified' pay deal"There are no offers from Treasury coupled with the loud silence by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to facilitate execution of this agreement," Muturi said."By and by, the country might be losing the goodwill of this gentlemen s agreement as time flies towards the next general elections," he said.The embattled IEBC commissioners formally agreed to resign, ending several tumultuous months of political confrontation and violent demonstrations.It was a clear victory for Cord, which called the protests to demand the removal of the team of nine, saying they were biased and incapable of holding fair and credible elections in 2017.The commissioners said at Parliament buildings they will step aside in the interests of the country if they receive a "dignified" send-off package.Read: Uhuru assents to Election Laws bill, sets stage for IEBC team exit
