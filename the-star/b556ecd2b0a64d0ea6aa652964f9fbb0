Nyeri Town MP Esther Murugi on Friday clashed with Nema board members when they visited a dumpsite near her residence. She complained the dumpsite is a health hazard as it is located near a residential area, Asian Quarters. She said the dumpsite is a haven of criminals who attack locals and rape women. Murugi criticised board director Patrick Ngatia and David Ong are, director in charge of compliance and enforcement, for doing too little despite residents protests over the years. We have a right to a clean environment. The local residents are even ready to burn these trucks pouring refuse here. Don t cheat us that you have alternative land since the county government has not allocated money in the budget for alternative land, Murugi said. Ong are said the dumpsite will be moved in six months. Ngatia said Nema and the county government have a plan to relocate the dumpsite. He said by April next year trucks will be banned from dumping refuse there.
