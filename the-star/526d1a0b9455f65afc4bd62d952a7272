Laikipia speaker Patrick Mariru has said he will run for Laikipia West MP against incumbent Wachira Karani. Mariru said Laikipia politics will be issue-based, with the voters interests taking the centre stage next year. We will engage in the politics of water, roads, hospitals and education, he said. Mariru spoke during a fundraiser presided over by Deputy President William Ruto at 91 Municipality Primary School, Nyahururu, on Saturday.He said, however, he will support the MP during his remaining term in office. Whoever wins will shake the loser s hand, Mariru said. In response, Karani who was present, said the voters will decide when the time comes.
