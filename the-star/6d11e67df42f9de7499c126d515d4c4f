When I was a little kid living in the Coast, we often went down to the beach. My favourite trips were the ones we made during low tide. When the ocean receded, it left behind pools of water trapped in depressions in the rock, in which little fishes swam around. Often, I had this urge to scoop them up and take them out to the big blue ocean over yonder I thought they d be happier out in the open sea. But now I m thinking, maybe those little fishes in their little pools were perfectly happy exactly where they were. I remembered the fishes because of what happened to Kevin Roberts, who until recently was the chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising agency, and head coach at the agency s parent company, Publicis Groupe. A job he lost following the furore-eliciting comments he made during an interview, where he wandered onto the minefield of gender diversity in the workplace. He suggested that women in advertising did not want senior roles, specifically that of creative director.Not stopping there, Roberts added: many talented women at Saatchi reach a certain point in their careers and when offered the chance to become creative director, turn it down saying, I don t want to manage a piece of business and people, I want to keep doing the work . Their ambition is not vertical, it s this intrinsic, circular ambition to be happy. Was it so far-fetched then for Roberts to say many women and some men simply want to be happy and do the work. I think the bigger conversation Roberts was having, in his head at least, was, what does success look like? Is being shackled to a job 24 hours a day success? Is it time we redefined success?For most men it s easy, success is wealth, fame, and fortune one track. Women generally have much more depth, multiple tracks.Maybe what Roberts was saying was, not all fishes want to swim in the big blue ocean.
