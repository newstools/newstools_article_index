The government should develop a comprehensive sex education curriculum for nursery and primary school children, ACK Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit has said.He said ignorance leads many children to experiment with sex, drugs and alcohol. Morals should be instilled at a young age. Our society is getting lost when it comes to matters involving sex, alcoholism and drugs. The best thing we can do is to handle it by instilling the values of education in our children, Sapit said.He spoke during St Paul s University s 25th graduation ceremony in Limuru town on Friday.Present were chancellor Sam Kobia, vice chancellor Joseph Galgalo and deputy director of university education at the Ministry of Education Christopher Yegon. We are moving forward. We should not look back because we will start blaming ourselves for our mistakes. Let us look for strategies that will help our society see the fruits of hardwork, Sapit said.He said lack of a sexuality education programme has made children discover different alcoholic brands and condoms through the media . Our children are watching too much television, where adverts of condoms and alcoholic drinks are aired. This makes them grow up quickly. No matter how much we teach them, they have already been exposed to these matters and they will try, Sapit said.Galgalo urged parents to take their children to church and other religious institutions so they can learn good morals.He said parents should also take children to school because they also need to become well-adjusted members of society. Churches and mosques also have a duty to ensure our children become decent members of society Galgalo said.
