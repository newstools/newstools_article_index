Nairobi woman representative aspirant Millicent Omanga has called for the amendment of the Micro-Finance Act so that interest rates can come down.She told the Star on phone that despite the interest rates on bank loans coming down, the interests of loans from Micro-Finance institutions are yet to be effected.Omanga said that the Banking act lowering interest rates at 14 per cent as signed into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta only serves the well-to-do people in society and not the common man."Majority of women and youth cannot afford the bank loans since they are not salaried. They are forced to go to micro-finance institutions yet the interest rates are still high. We have to amend the micro-finance act to help the low income earners in society," she said.She said that the problem that affects Nairobi women is poor leadership from legislators who do not have the interests of the people at heart.Omanga said that most women leaders simply wait for men to endorse them and do not go out to fight for the positions.She said that once elected as the woman representative, she will work hard to ensure that the boy child is not neglected as is the case is."I want to tell off women legislators that most of them have done little to empower women and youth. Once elected, I will serve all residents equally irrespective of who they are and ensure that there is job creation," she said.
