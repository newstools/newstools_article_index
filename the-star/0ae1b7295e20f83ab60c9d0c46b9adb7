We also have 100 acres, buildings that served as field offices, a dairy cow demo farm and several flagship projects, Simon Wesechere, the federation s deputy secretary, told journalists in Kakamega.Moco, which was owned by sugarcane farmers contracted to the ailing Mumias Sugar Company, collapsed eight years ago due to mismanagement .
