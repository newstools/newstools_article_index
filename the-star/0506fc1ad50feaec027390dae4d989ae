The event is set for July 12 and 16, 2017.Wario added that the government was ready to fund the KU village since IAAF promised to turn it into a high performance training centre (HPTC). I shall seek help from the Education ministry to boost renovations at Kenyatta University to make it a world class athletes training centre, he said.Local Organising Committee CEO Mwangi Muthee revealed last week that the IAAF would only transform the varsity into an HPTC if the government committed to ensuring itis transformed into a facility of high standards befitting an Under-18 Championships village. All the rooms at Kenyatta University will be renovated with the facility benefiting from the competition and warm up tracks that will be laid at Kasarani, said Muthe.He added that the Village will have fully-fledged ultra-modern equipment including a modern running track.Meanwhile, most facilities at Moi International Sports Centre will be locked down at the end of October for earmarked renovations.Local and IAAF engineers led by Cristian Burril from Italian track manufacturer Mondo have visited Kasarani, where a blue tartan will be laid, and KU. A borehole will be sunk near the competition venue to address water issue, said Muthee adding that IAAF technical delegates will be in the country between October 16 and 20 to start the renovations.
