Nandi County Women MP Zipporrah Kering says she will fight to retain her seat next year through Jubilee because she needs another term to complete the projects she has initiated to empower women.Kering said she had been mobilizing women to participate in self empowerment projects and her efforts were achieving success. I still need more time to ensure that the welfare of women is improved in my county and other parts of the country. I will ask the people on Nandi to re-elect me again next year , said Kering.She was speaking in Ainabkoi Constituency in Uasin Gishu during a ceremony where jubilee aspirant for the seat William Chepkut was installed as an elder. Chepkut was endorsed by the elders to vie for the seat against MP for the area Samwel Chepkonga.Chepkut said he if elected he would fight for equal opportunities for residents of the area and economic empowerment to fight poverty and ignorance.Kering said Nandi County had benefitted from Sh 13 million from the Affirmative Action Fund but there was need to increase the money so that it benefits more women initiatives.At the same time she said there was need for more women to come up and vie for all elective seats in order to improve their representation at all levels. Women should not fear vying for all seats including that of Governor, Senator and MP because we are few in leadership at all levels including in counties , said Kering.She said women had better management skills and honesty adding that those already in elective positions had been performing well. We will go out to sensitize more women to come out and vie for political seats next year , said Kering. In Nandi she will face more than ten other aspirants who have declared interest in her seat.Kering rooted for Jubilee saying it was the best party in terms of helping to unite Kenyans. She said President Kenyatta and his Deputy Wiliam Rutoi deserve re-election next year because they had performed well in the first term.ENDS
