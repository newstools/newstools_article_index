Kenya Volleyball Federation and its current officials are once again in court fighting for their legitimacy.Whereas the first petition questioning the legality of KVF at the Sports Dispute Tribunal by Gideon Njine was pinned on registration, Moses Mbuthia s is pegged on the federation s constitution. The Kenya National Sports Council treasurer Charles Nyaberi is the second petitioner.In his petition, Mbuthia claims KVF was an illegitimate body at the time the current office was elected. He acknowledged the federation complied with the Sports Act 2013 by drafting a new constitution, but used the old charter at the April 26 2014 election which makes KVF an illegal entity. The petition also claimed the federation was not registered at the time of election.In the Tuesday hearings, Mbuthia s lawyer Theophilus Kamwaro noted a contradiction in the constitution, that there is a provision for promulgation that negates Article 75 which indicates the constitution will come to effect through a Special General Meeting.Kamwaro also indicated all activities the federation carried out after March 1 2014 (when the constitution was passed) inclusive of the election are illegitimate.In his petition Mbuthia, who lost the KVF presidency position to Waithaka Kioni in the 2014 election prayed the Tribunal throws out KVF officials and constitute a caretaker committee to run the sport.Counsel Migwi Mungai, representing KVF read some selfish objectives in the petition since he was the loser in the polls held over two years back. Thus, the SDT chair John Ohaga inquired why Mbuthia took so long to petition, and why he participated in what he termed as an illegal election.It also emerged that Mbuthia had lodged a complaint with the KNSC who decreed that the SOYA federation of the year 2015 (KVF) had followed the right procedure in conducting the election.Meanwhile, the petition also noted KVF had not adhered to the two thirds gender rule in its national executive committee. As constituted, Kamwaro said women hold less than a third of positions by one.
