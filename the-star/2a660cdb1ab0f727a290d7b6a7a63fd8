He said JP interim officials in Nairobi have not appointed any person to head county branches.Alluding to the fighting that occurred last Saturday at the JP offices in Nakuru town, Kamama said there is no power vacuum. JP has not appointed anyone to be party officials in Nakuru, he said.Kamama said they are still waiting for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to give a directive on party structures. Kamama said those fighting to control the JP offices in Nakuru are leaders guided by selfish interests.He urged security personnel to investigate the matter and bring to book those involved in the fracas.
