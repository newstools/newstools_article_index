Most people associate fire with being destructive and bringing death, but there are controlled conditions that cause fire to bring life.Currently, the Nairobi National Park is virtually surrounded by human developments built over the years. Ancient migration routes have been reduced to a mere trickle, and over time and especially after good rains this year, the plant biomass has grown and dried out. With the migration route being severely restricted, I believe it is important that alternative methods be considered to ensure that more herbivores remain inside the park boundaries.If the herbivores remain inside, then the predators, such as lions, will tend to remain inside the park.The challenge is to turn the herds as quickly as possible after the rains, when their natural instinct to migrate happens. Controlled burning programmes have been successful in many places in Africa, especially if measured scientific methods are used. To burn dry grass biomass and successfully transform a dead grass area to have fresh green shoots attracting herbivores, a cold fire method is required, where a fire is lit in a demarcated zone with firebreaks just before a rainstorm. Scientifically, it has been proven that burning should happen approximately every 10 years, depending on the climate.Heavy rains are forecasted over the next few weeks, so it s time to plan for select areas of the park to be burned with cold fires. Hopefully KWS will do this action and bring new life to the park.
