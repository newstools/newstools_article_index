The government targets to provide electricity connections to 70 per cent of the population through the Last Mile Connectivity project by December next year, Kenya Power MD Ben Chumo has said.Speaking during the launch of the project at Nyigoon Primary School, Mosop, Nandi county, on Tuesday, Chumo said they want to provide power connection to as many Kenyans as possible. Several homes were connected to the national grid. Chumo was accompanied by area MP Stephen Bitok.Bitok urged residents to form Last Mile committees and come up with a list of households to make it easy for Kenya Power to plan the connection schedule. Since we want each household connected, the list will help Kenya Power in designing and estimating the cost of the materials required, he said.The government allocated Ksh65 billion to the national project. Bitok said electricity will help in poverty eradication and improved lives. There are businesses you can start with the availability of power. I want the youth to use this opportunity and establish businesses, such as welding, salons and kinyozi (barbershops). This will provide income and improve your standards of living, Bitok said.
