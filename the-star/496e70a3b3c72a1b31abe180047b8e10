Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to publicly condemn the recent protests against the appointment of acting Moi University VC.The demo at the university's Eldoret campus was led by Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu), Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet) and a host of MPs from the North Rift region.The leaders wanted to stop the appointment of Prof Laban Ayiro as the VC, citing discrepancies in the outcome of interviews for the college's VC.Namwamba on Sunday said that Mandago's action were against Chapter Six of the constitution on leadership and integrity, adding that the acts makes the governor unfit to be a public officer."That conduct goes against chapter six of the constitution of integrity and ethics. Anybody who spreads ethnic hate and celebrates division against tribal lines is not allowed to hold a public office," he said.The legislator described the the incident as "the most outdated and backward behavior that can ever be exhibited by a leader of in the caliber of a governor"."You cannot storm a university of such a magnitude with cheap tribal politics, and when condemned, still go on national television and talk bad," Namwamba said.He told Mandago that the Uasin Gishu county where he is the boss is full of Kenyans of diverse origin who cannot be sidelined in various positions due to their tribal origins."We are now calling upon the Kalenjin elders and Jubilee government to publicly condemn this act. We all know that Prof Ayiro is a qualified citizen who can lead any university in this country," he said."I want to challenge the Jubilee government to come out clearly and condemn the incident so that we know they are fully committed to fight against tribalism. They cannot tell us today in Nairobi that we are together and tomorrow in Uasin Gishu we are not," he said.Namwamba said that Jubilee should know that the concept of unity is not about rhetoric talks but about actions which speaks louder than words."They must not bury their head in the sand on this matter as if everything is alright," he said, adding that Jubilee policies will not unite Kenyans but actions that show unity.The LPK party leader said that its saddening that the country has gone against the "justice should be our shield and defender" as the national anthem states.Read: Khalwale hits at DP Ruto over loud silence on protest against acting Moi University VC
