Former Lugari Member of Parliament (MP) Cyrus Jirongo has been replaced as the Kenyan Premier League club, AFC Leopards patron. Jirongo will be replaced by an International management and economic consultant Dr. Francis Inganji.The new Ingwe office under the chairmanship of Dan Mule elected made changes in the appointment of a new patron and trustees, who were unveiled at Hotel Milimani last week. Former Kilimani ward civic leader Linnet Merihane was appointed as the new trustee and will be joined by two more trustees who will be appointed later.The new trustees replaces Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi, Nairobi women s representative Rachel Shebesh, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa and nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro.The new members pledged to support Mule s office to implement their manifesto and extended an olive branch to election losers to join hands with the office for the good of the club. They unveiled an ambitious plan of buying land to construct a state of the art stadium, training ground, club house, secretariat and a sports academy for AFC as they targeted Sh200 million to realise that ambition. Inganji donated Sh5 million to kick start the process of pursuing that obligation of the Ingwe stadium and academy s construction. I want to engage the team in long term sustainable projects that will generate income so that the culture of seeking for handouts to survive will be a thing of the past, he said.
