Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung aro is to be installed as a Mijikenda elder, effectively becoming the Coast s new kingpin, a source close to the MP has disclosed.Mungaro s ambition and elevation will heighten the rivalry between him and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho of ODM, long viewed as the Coast s supremo.He is expected to be installed soon before President Uhuru Kenyatta visits next month, but the date has not been announced.The source told the Star Mung aro has held a series of meetings with Mijikenda elders to sell his agenda. Mung aro could not be reached by press time.The Kaya elders and the Jubilee-allied leaders are expected to witness his elevation at Tononoka.Mung aro believes he is the person to deliver the Coast votes to Jubilee. In 2017, he will run against Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi.The source said preparations are advanced. Our aim is to make Mung aro the Coast kingpin. We are confident he will deliver not only to Kilifi, but to the entire region, he said.He said Mung aro has received a positive response from the elders who believe it is high time the region worked with the government to spur development.The elders are comfortable with Mung aro as the right link to government and person for the job, he said.During the Malindi by-election in March, Mung aro campaigned for Jubilee candidate Phillip Charo; however, ODM s Willy Mtengo won.Political observers viewed the by-election as a contest between Mung aro and Joho with regard to Coast supremacy. At that time Joho was seen to have overcome the first hurdle in his quest to be the region s undisputed leader.
