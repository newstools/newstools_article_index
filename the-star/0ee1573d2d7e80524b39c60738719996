Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has dismissed former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo s political ambitions, saying he will teach him a political lesson .Murkomen said Kimaiyo s ambitions to become Elgeyo Marakwet senator and face Deputy President William Ruto for presidency in 2022 are unrealistic.Murkomen is a close ally of the DP and President Uhuru Kenyatta. He said despite being younger than Kimaiyo, he has experience in national politics and is a better leader.Political rivalry between the two intensified on Sunday when Kimaiyo accused Murkomen of lacking the experience to lead Elgeyo Marakwet.He accused Murkomen of engineering his downfall from the police service and at the Kenya Airports Authority board, where he was chairman.The remarks angered Murkomen, who told Kimaiyo not to belittle him.Speaking on the phone on Wednesday, Murkomen said, What experience is Kimaiyo talking about? He has experience in the police service and I have experience in politics. I have never been a police officer and Kimaiyo has never been a legislator. So he should not bring up the issue of experience. He went on, I have never accused him of inexperience as a legislator because he has never served in Parliament or in the county assembly. Kimaiyo said his 35 years experience in the police service will help him become a better senator. I worked for this country for 35 years, starting as a police constable and retiring from the service in the highest rank as IG. Elgeyo Marakwet needs this kind of experience, he said.Kimaiyo said Elgeyo Marakwet residents asked him to vie for the seat after Murkomen failed to deliver services.Murkomen has a huge following among the youth, who form a large number of voters. Former URP chairman John Kangogo and Nairobi businessman Baranabas Boit have also declared their interest in the seat.
