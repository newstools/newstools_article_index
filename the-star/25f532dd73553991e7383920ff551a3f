Kanu is working on a plan to rebrand ahead of the elections.One of the suggestions to be considered is to have Baringo Senator Gideon Moi elevated to the position of Party Leader. The party may then have a national chairman under him.Secretary general Nick Salat yesterday said an in-house committee has been put in place to work on the expected changes as part of the rebranding. Gideon has approved proposals to brand the party afresh. We want to expand that committee to bring on board many other people, who will inject more ideas on how we should move forward, Salat said. He spoke to the Star on the phone. The party plans to fill vacant positions occasioned by defections since last year, Salat said.He said they would also hold a National Executive Committee meeting to discuss the defection by some members to the Jubilee Party. We will take our position on the defections and other national matters, Salat said. He said they have started receiving expressions of interest from many aspirants, who want to vie in the 2017 elections through the party ticket.Former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo, who has joined politics in Elgeyo Marakwet, is expected to run for the Senate seat using the Kanu ticket. But he said he is still consulting. Kimaiyo is among leaders who argue that Kanu needs to rebrand. I will make a decision after consulting people, including my friends in Kanu, he said. Kimaiyo has, however, not ruled out running as an independent candidate.Kanu officials in Rift Valley led by Paul Kibet said they support rebranding of the party. Among key members who shifted to Jubilee are West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin and Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto. Kanu and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto s CCM are expected to give Jubilee leaders a run for their money in the Rift Valley.
