Kisauni parliamentary aspirant Ali Mbogo s invitation to accompany ODM leader Raila Odinga to Germany has thrown the incumbent Rashid Bedzimba s camp off-balance.Sources say the camp is planning a series of meetings to analyse the impact of the trip.Mbogo accompanied Raila for a five-day business meeting on a personal invitation from the opposition chief. The two are said to have met at a Mombasa hotel on Friday and Saturday last week when Raila attended the party s 10th anniversary celebrations.Mbogo skipped the anniversary because his wife was unwell and did not want to cause commotion at the event, one of his aides said.Mbogo and Bedzimba have been criticising each other as they battle for the parliamentary seat. Earlier this year, Mbogo expressed concern over the fairness of the nomination process.
