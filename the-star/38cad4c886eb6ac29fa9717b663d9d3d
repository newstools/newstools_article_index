Tana River MPs are working on a formula through which small tribes will have a share of elective seats. We want a Tana River county that is all inclusive. This is the only way to end tribalism, marginalisation and forms of discrimination, Garsen MP Ibrahim Sane said on Monday.The three big tribes are Pokomo, Orma and Wardhei. Bura MP Ali Wario said the formula will be announced soon.
