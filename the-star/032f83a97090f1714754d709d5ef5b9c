Two governors and several MPs stormed Moi University on Tuesday to stop newly appointed acting VC Laban Ayiro from taking over. Education CS Fred Matiang&#39;i appointed Ayiro to replace outgoing vice chancellor Richard Mibey whose term ended on Monday. Ayiro, who is acting deputy vice-chancellor in charge of planning, is to&nbsp; act for three months before the substantive VC is appointed. More on this:&nbsp; Prof Laban Ayiro appointed acting Moi University vice-chancellorUasin Gishu G overnor Jackson Mandago, who led the protest wit Elgeyo Marakwet&#39;s Alex Tolgos, said they want professor Isaac Kosgey appointed as he&nbsp; &quot;topped recruitment interviews&quot;&nbsp; He said they will stop the university&#39;s graduation ceremony on Friday if Kosgey is not installed. &ldquo;We want to be very clear on this. There will be no graduation on&nbsp;Friday &nbsp;if Kosgey is not the VC,&quot; he said in address to workers at the institution.&nbsp;&quot;We have told Matiang&#39;i to immediately release his appointment letter.&quot; He said they could not understand why Kosgey was being &quot;blocked&quot; yet he came second in similar interviews at Egerton University.Others who took part in the protest were MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Sila Tiren (Moiben), James Bett (Kesses) and Uasin Gishu county assembly speaker Isaac Terer. Sudi said:&nbsp;&ldquo;We will cut all trees and use all means possible to block roads and ensure there is no graduation on&nbsp; Friday.&quot; He claimed Matiang&#39;i was opposed to the appointment of a Kalenjin. &ldquo;We wonder why they have to wait for DP William Ruto to be out of the country to mess up with our university. We will not accept that,&quot; he said. The leaders earlier met Ayiro and&nbsp;university council chairman professor Jenasio Kinyamario. They warned acting VC against entering the office and demanded the confirmation of 3,500 casual labourers. Matiang&#39;i named Ayiro acting VC in a letter to&nbsp; Kinyamario, who said the substantive VC would be hired&nbsp; in line with laws governing the university. The council has carried out interviews for the position and submitted three names to Matiang&#39;i who is to pick one.But sources said&nbsp;political interests delayed the appointment, with politicians from the North Rift and South Rift rooting for one of them. Mibey went on terminal leave a month ago but returned&nbsp; under unclear circumstances &nbsp;after two weeks, sparking protests by staff members. Jack Abok, s ecretary of the Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU), said:&nbsp; &ldquo;We want a CEO who will be able to streamline this university and revive its operations because it was on its death bed.&quot; The union said the university has a Sh1.4 billion including&nbsp; workers&#39; statutory deductions that have not been remitted and salary arrears. Mibey&nbsp;took over David Some, who is now&nbsp; Commission of Higher Education chief executive in 2006.He retred after the 10-year tenure. He is credited with the quick expansion of the university, increasing the number of students to more than 35,000. But he leaves behind a troubled institution whose seven top managers were suspended following claims of corruption and illegal hiring. Those suspended include two deputy vice chancellors and sources.&nbsp; An audit at the&nbsp;institution&nbsp;revealed the managers could not account for more than Sh 5 billion. Kinyamario said the university council was in the process of dealing with cases affecting the suspended staff who will be given chances to defend themselves.
