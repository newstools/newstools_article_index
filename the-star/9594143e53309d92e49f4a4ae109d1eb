Coast-based political party Kadu Asili banks on welcoming politicians afraid of being locked out during nominations.Politicians Sanga Barawa (Malindi), Francisco Esposito (Magarini) and Lucas Maitha (Kilifi) want to vie on the party s ticket. Kadu Asili has over the years struggled to be identified as purely a Coast outfit. It expects more defectors from Jubilee and Cord. National secretary general Jimmy Ngala said seasoned and veteran politicians have sensed they will be locked out if they remain in big parties. Esposito, an Italian businessman, met the party s top brass in a Malindi resort last weekend to strategise on his political ambitions.
