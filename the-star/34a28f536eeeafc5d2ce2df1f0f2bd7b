MCAs in Cord zones seem to have been compromised by their governors, Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale has said.Khalwale said this on Thursday, noting most of the impeachment motions the Senate has received in the last three years were against Jubilee governors. It means MCAs in Jubilee areas seem to have understood their role of oversight more than their Cord counterparts, he said.A motion for ODM Governor Evans Kidero's impeachment was tabled by Viwandani MCA Samwel Nyang'wara, also a member of the party, on Tuesday.But the MCA has faced opposition from the party, which has removed him from county assembly committees. ODM ward representatives tried to block him from tabling the motion against Kidero, resulting in two cases of chaos at the Nairobi assembly.Kidero will appear before the assembly next Tuesday to defend himself against allegations of corruption and violation of the constitution.Read: Kidero to face assembly next Tuesday after impeachment petitionKiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi said the judiciary has been interfering with processes of impeaching leaders.Wamatangi said courts should keep off the work of other arms of government.Nandi Senator Stephen Sang said the motion against Kidero was questionable as it was anchored on issues that arose in 2013. Why now? he asked, when the politicians spoke on Citizen TV s breakfast show.But Mombasa's Hassan Omar said leaders can be impeached at any point during their terms, regardless of the time at which issues were raised against them.He added that there were weighty constitutional issues concerning the judiciary in the oversight roles of the county assemblies.Khalwale and Omar said they had no problem with Cord leader Raila Odinga being the coalition s presidential flag bearer in 2017.Khalwale said that co-principals Moses Wetang'ula or Kalonzo Musyoka were demonstrating healthy internal democracy by asking Raila to back either one of them. We shall support Raila if the process of picking the flag bearer is free and fair and ends up with him, said Omar.But Wamatangi and Sang said Raila's candidacy was a done deal.Read: I will beat you hands down, Raila tells Uhuru after ODM endorsement for presidentMachakos Senator Johnson Muthama said on Radio Jambo that Cord was simply being strategic.He said the coalition was intact and that the perception of a crisis in the choice of a flag bearer was wrong.Read: Raila defends Kalonzo, Wetang'ula, says bids against him part of game plan
