Three politicians were yesterday grilled over the remarks they made after the appointment of Laban Ayiro as acting Moi University VC.They are Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, his Elgeyo Marakwet Alex Tolgos and Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi.The three were among politicians summoned to record statements.Mandago, Tolgos and Sudi arrived at Nairobi s CID headquarters at 1.15pm. They were flanked by several MCAs. The three were questioned until past 4.30pm, when they left the offices.Others expected to record statements are MPs Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills), James Bett (Kesses) and Tiren Silas (Moiben). They had stormed Moi University to protest against the the appointment of acting VC Laban Ayiro, who took over from Richard Mibey. Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery ordered they be questioned, saying they risk arrest if they fail to record statements. He said the six had incited the public to protest against the university management.Mandago said they still stood by whatever they said in Eldoret.He said, however, he will not reveal the information they had given to the detectives, saying this would jeopardise investigations.Mandago cautioned media not to sensationalise the matter while reporting, as it could trigger violence.Meanwhile, riot police were forced to use teargas to disperse some Eldoret residents who were demonstrating in support of the two governors and the MPs.Hundreds of youth carrying placards and twigs barricaded several roads in the town, forcing police to intervene and disperse them.Last week, the governor threatened to stop the university s graduation ceremony last Friday, if Prof Isaac Kosgey is not installed as vice chancellor. There will be no graduation on Friday if Kosgey is not the VC, he said. We have told Matiang i to immediately release his appointment letter.
