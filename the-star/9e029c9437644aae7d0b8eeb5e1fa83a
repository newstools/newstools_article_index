A series of awareness meetings have been convened in Mai Mahiu and Narok after the standard gauge railway route was identified and settled by the government and the contractor.The decision comes barely a week after conservationists stopped construction through the Nairobi National Park.Naivasha subcounty commissioner Isaac Masinde said the route and the locations for depots have been identified and construction will start in two months.Masinde said the railway line will pass through Satellite, Duka Moja and Kedong, before winding up in Olkaria, where an industrial park will be constructed. The Naivasha route has now been settled and various government agencies will embark on engaging those affected, he said.Masinde said officers from the National Land Commission will start acquiring the land, ahead of the project launch.He urged the affected communities to cooperate. Works on various sites the contractor will use are nearly complete, Masinde said.He urged the public to be wary of unscrupulous traders going round claiming to be surveyors planning the SGR route. Some people have been fleeced by conmen, who promise to make sure the SGR passes through their farms, Masinde said.This came as workers hired by the Chinese contractor in Mai Mahiu and Duka Moja cried foul over poor working and transport conditions.The workers said criticised the employer for using open trucks to ferry them to their workplace, saying it is dangerous and illegal . The government recently banned ferrying of sand loaders on open trucks. But the contractor has ignored, said a worker who declined to be named. He said their workplace is dusty and dangerous to their health.
