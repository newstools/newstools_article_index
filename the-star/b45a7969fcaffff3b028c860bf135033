The National Land Commission has repossessed 7,000 public properties illegally acquired. They include public utility land, riparian land, schools, hospitals, forest and county government land. NLC vice chairperson Abigael Mbagaya said they will not allow public property be remain in private hands. She said they received a complaint from the Housing ministry that some of its houses in Kisumu had been alienated and titles issued to private individuals. Mbagaya spoke in Kisumu on Monday during the review of grants and disposition of property owned by the directorate of housing. We put out a notice asking those interested in the particular property to avail themselves for the hearing to explain how they acquired such particular land, she said. Mbagaya said some people hold title deeds to government houses and fraudulent letters.
