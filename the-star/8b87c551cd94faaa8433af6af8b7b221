The state-owned KBC and Mombasa county are still feuding over 22 acres in Nyali.The county had earlier agreed to obey a court order allowing KBC to fence off the land, but has reversed its decision.In what is seen as a move to frustrate the broadcaster, the county yesterday listed a raft of conditions for KBC to fulfil before it is allowed to develop the land.KBC and Mombasa have been fighting for the ownership of the land for years. The national government last Friday threatened to arrest Governor Hassan Joho for contempt of court after he ordered the fence be pulled down.Joho previously has accused the national government of undermining him. The county is using its constitutional powers to keep KBC off the land. A statement from the governor s office said KBC must meet 10 conditions for a 99-year lease to be issued.The two parties had agreed to let lawyers interpret whether fencing off the land involves putting up a perimeter wall using stones, a chain link or wooden fence.The county had also agreed to stop using the plot as a dumping site. The statement from the governor s office said the land should be reverted back to the county. No further buildings will be erected until plans, drawings, elevations and specifications are approved in writing by the Local Authority and Commissioner of Lands, the statement reads.The county wants the land to be used as a wireless transmitting station. KBC was asked to pay the Commissioner of Lands the estimated cost of building roads, drains and sewers serving or adjoining the land. Should the Commissioner of Lands at any time require the said roads to be constructed to a higher standard, the grantee should pay, the statement reads.
