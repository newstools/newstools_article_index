Several North Rift politicians are being investigated by the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights for alleged involvement in cattle rustling.On Saturday, KNCHR vice chairman George Morara said cattle rustling has been commercialised, with far-reaching adverse economic and social consequences.He said the KNCHR will soon publicise report on its investigations, detailing how some politicians support cattle rustling, besides inciting communities to engage in banditry. We will not just sit and watch the conflict here being treated as if it s a normal cultural practice. It s a conflict-driven economy it has become bigger, because there are people supporting it, Morara said.He said investigations focus on all aspects of banditry-related conflicts in the North Rift counties, including Pokot, Turkana, Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet and Samburu.Banditry attacks last year had declined in all the counties, but last month there were renewed attacks in Kerio Valley along the border of Marakwet East and Baringo counties. Leaders from the two counties have traded accusations against each other over who has been supporting the attacks. Professionals from the Marakwet community protested over the attacks and claimed the community lost more than 600 people in the last one decade through banditry.The GSU is carrying out a security operation in Kerio Valley to arrest bandits, who have been attacking villages.Marakwet East police boss Emannuel Rono said they will try to recover all stolen animals. Residents said the government should compensate families of those killed by bandits. The government has also approved a plan to hire 450 police reservists.
