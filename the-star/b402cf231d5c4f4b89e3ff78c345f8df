We thought they were police."Mbute s father George Githiri said they called his phones after learning of the 'arrest' but that they had been switched off.Githiri said they then went to the AP's office for details.He said officers did not recognise the car they described and advised them to report the incident as a kidnapping.The police commander said family members and residents reported the matter at his office and at Lari police station.Waititu said police started investigations and had Mbute's bank accounts blocked before he was found dead. He said the DCI was also carrying out a probe.Mbute's father said they suspect his wife committed the crime as they had separated. Our main suspect is his wife. She was seen at Kimende on Monday... that is rare. We do not know where she lives. Let s not discuss that issue," he said.He said the family will provide police with all the information needed to complete investigations.
