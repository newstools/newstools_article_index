A driver accused killing a university student while trying to avoid an alcoblow test has lost a bid to stop his prosecution.Job Nyongesa is accused of killing 21-year-old Brian Kaimbati on January 30.City magistrate Elector Riany said on Tuesday the trial will proceed to full hearing.The prosecution said Nyongesa drove on the wrong side of the road and rammed into another vehicle that was being driven by the first year engineering student.The accident took place as Nyongesa tried to avoid a road block where alcoblow tests were being taken.Nyongesa had objected to the trial on the grounds that the charge sheet was defective.Through his lawyer John Khaminiwa, he argued that the charge sheet presented by the prosecution has used his Christian names. He said that was unlawful, since the State has no religion.But State counsel Mary Nganga said Nyongesa was applying delay tactics.She said the charge sheet met all constitutional requirements.Nyongesa is out on a cash bail of Sh100,000.Read: Three die in fatal accidents along Thika Super Highway evading alcoblow
