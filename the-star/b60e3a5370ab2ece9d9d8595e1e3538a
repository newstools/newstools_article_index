A Kisumu assembly committee has been tasked to find Sh2.2 million meant for members. Market Milimani MCA Edwin Anayo said Governor Jack Ranguma gave Manyatta B MCA Nereah Okombo the money to be shared among 22 MCAs who support Ranguma, Anayo said.He told the assembly on Wednesday afternoon that only four MCAs know the location of the money and the rest should be told where it is and why it was not shared out. The speaker of the day, MCA Elijah Omondi, directed the House Privileges and Power Committee to investigate. Omondi told the Star the House had no information on the statement raised but the committee will ascertain the truth. During the morning session, Okombo and nominated MCA Lydia Odhiambo nearly came to blows. If it were not for the sergeant-at-arm who held Nereah back, the two would have fought, an MCA said. The MCA said Odhiambo hurled insults at Okombo. Omondi said the incident was very unfortunate . He said members should act with decorum. He said any member found culpable will be punished. East Seme MCA Aggrey Ogosi told the Star every time a member who does not support the executive raises an issue in the assembly, the executive intervenes. The executive is giving out money to divide members and this is just one of the many cases we have, he said.The governor s office director of communication Dennis Onyango dismissed the claims as propaganda. He said Ranguma enjoys massive support in the assembly and does not need to pay for it. Onyango said Ranguma is out of the country and is not in touch with any MCA.
