Education CS Fred Matiang i has put the county education directors on notice.He said they will be held responsible for illegal school levies in their areas of jurisdiction. The CS told MPs he is sad that despite fee ceilings set by the ministry for all public schools, there is a surge in arbitrary fees increments.The payments are mostly illegally approved by unscrupulous education officials colluding with rogue school heads, he said.Matiang i told the National Assembly Education Committee the government has come up with stringent guidelines to make it mandatory for all county education directors to record the fee structures approved for every secondary school.The Education ministry fee ceiling guidelines stipulate that parents pay Sh53,554 for boarding schools, Sh9,374 for day schools and Sh37,210 for special needs schools.The government provides a subsidy of Sh12,870 for every learner per year.
