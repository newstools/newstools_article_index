What has really compelled Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko to team up with two MPs eying City Hall? Word has it Sonko developed cold feet when Water CS Eugene Wamalwa teamed up with former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru to oust incumbent Governor Evans Kidero. It is said Sonko, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru and TNA chairman Johnson Sakaja could not afford wasting time to team up after realising the Eugene-Wanjiru collabo and influence through rallies was spreading like wildfire. Corridors is told Sonko who earlier had indicated he will run for the big county job as an independent stood no chance to win unless he teamed up with the two. *********So what really happened to make hardliner Cord MPs give in and agree not to shoot down the anti-party hopping Bill? Corridors has learnt it took the intervention of an ambassador from a Western country who exerted pressure on the Cord co-principals to whip the legislators to support the Bill. A little bird in Cord whispers to Corridors that the ambassador personally called one of the principals and told him, It isn t going to be business as usual if your lieutenants are not going to support the Bill. It was passed by the National Assembly on Thursday night.********* Still in Parliament, a legislator from Nyanza region was overheard bitterly telling his colleagues soon after the passage of the anti-party hopping Bill that the MPs had held a gun to their heads and it was only a matter of time before the effects of the Bill would be felt.The first-time MP went ahead to say that he will consider defending his seat as an independent candidate and he is aware the party is supporting a different candidate for the 2017 election .**********A plot has been hatched to remove some members of the National Police Service Commission. Those behind it say they want the commissioners out to allow them to continue doing business as usual. Moles say they first plotted the mission using a suspect facing several charges in court. But they chickened out after realising his image would be questioned. After Kinisu the Police Commission is next, said one of those aware of the whole plot. Unfortunately, those behind it are people in big government offices. They recently transferred an official from the Police Commission to Harambee House without consulting the employer, as part of efforts to undermine the war on graft. We are watching.**********Still on police matters, it seems like hard work doesn t pay within the Police Service. A hard working police officer on the outskirts of Nairobi has been quickly transferred at the behest of criminals who have been frustrated by the sleuth. The senior cop, who has been instrumental in fighting crime, especially robberies along the Thika Superhighway, is so frustrated he is contemplating quitting the service.**********Embakasi East MP John Ogutu Omondi was overheard praising his colleagues for unanimously passing the anti-party hopping Bill. Omondi was heard bragging that once he defeats his opponents, he will then go ahead to win the elections because they will have no option but to support him. I will defeat them then go ahead and win.
