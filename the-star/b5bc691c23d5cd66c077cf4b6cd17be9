Lang'ata MP Joash Olum has said he will identify and support local artistes from the Kibera slums.Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, the MP said he was impressed with the local talent."I think the best way to help youth will be to get somebody like Jua Kali and Nonini and invite all interested youth to perform. Then Jua Kali or Nonini will be the judges and the winning groups or individuals will be given cash to record and come up with their albums," he said.He was presiding over an eponymous sports tournament at Undugu Grounds in Kibera.Olum said helping the youth record their music will market them and give them an opportunity to grow in their careers."I want the youth to succeed. I will not give you handouts but I will ensure you have something better to do," he said at the event.He said this would be a better way of helping young people and empowering them.
