Chama Cha Uzalendo leader Wavinya Ndeti has accused the Machakos government of "sitting on emergency funds".She said the government has neglected victims of a fire tragedy in Mavoko subcounty. Where is the emergency fund? What does the county leadership do with it? We have not seen the county government help families since a fire razed houses in Mlolongo, Slota and Sofia slums, Ndeti said.She spoke in Athi River town when she visited the victims on Sunday.Ndeti donated assortment of items including blankets, utensils, stoves, cooking oil, maize flour, basins, soap and clothes to more than 300 victims of both Slota and Sofia Slums who lost their property to fire inferno recently.The fire destroyed 40 mabati houses in Sofia last Tuesday, a week after Slota slum went up on flames. A man was killed in the fire.Ndeti said the county government should improve its emergency preparedness to ensure residents do not lose property and lives when when there are fire outbreaks.She said Mavoko subcounty needs more fire engines because it is big.
