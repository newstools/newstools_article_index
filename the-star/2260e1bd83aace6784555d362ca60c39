One of the most biting criticisms levelled against former Prime Minister Raila Odinga takes the form of a question: Why is it that so many of those who work most closely with him end up opposing him?The two most conspicuous examples given are the former Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi and Deputy President William Ruto.Following the 2007 General Election, Mudavadi was the ODM Deputy Party leader, and also DPM. Ruto was an influential Cabinet minister. By the 2013 General Election, both these men had bolted out of ODM to set up their own political parties, with Ruto ending up as the DP when he supported Uhuru Kenyatta s successful run for President, while Mudavadi made his own run but ended up a distant third to Uhuru and Raila.So, why is it that those who work most closely with Raila end up going off in anger to form their own parties?I once put this question to a self-proclaimed Raila diehard . And he responded by telling me that I was asking the wrong question. The real question, he told me, was this: Where would Ruto and Mudavadi be, if they had not received a huge boost from their association with Raila? He then pointed out that, prior to the creation of ODM, Ruto had been a Kanu operative, answerable to Gideon Moi and Uhuru Kenyatta. And that had Ruto not made a belated entry into Raila s inner circle, he would have remained on the sidelines of national politics to this day.As for Mudavadi, the Raila diehard spoke of him as having been resurrected by Raila, as he was more or less a failed politician after the 2002 General Election.For in the 2002 election, Mudavadi, while serving as Daniel Moi s last Vice President, lost his own Sabatia constituency seat to a political newcomer Moses Akaranga. And you really cannot suffer a more complete political collapse than that.It is only when he linked his political fortunes to Raila s that Mudavadi rose from the ashes like the proverbial phoenix.Now it seems like it is Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho s turn to be the man most widely seen as Raila s right hand man just ahead of a general election.It may be that this will in time come to be be seen as his biggest mistake.Or it may be that it will mark his first step towards a key role in national politics.
