Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has launched a Sh40 million renal unit. He said the unit will not only help residents, but people from Busia and Kakamega counties. My government will carry out dialysis services free of charge this week, the governor said. Lusaka said specialists are being trained to run the unit. They will graduate on November 5. We are determined to make the Bungoma County Referral Hospital a medical facility of choice, Lusaka said. He said they will renovate health facilities with more focus on inpatient services.
