Security officials in Garissa have promised to issue a comprehensive press statement regarding the Thursday night attack in Hamey, in which al Shabaab militants attacked a police post.During the raid, the unknown number of militants stormed the police camp and fired indiscriminately, injuring three police officers and abducting four.An officer in critical condition was rushed to Nairobi for treatment. The other two were treated and discharged. The camp had 14 officers. On Sunday, thorough their official Twitter account, the militants posted photos displaying the weapons they seized during the attack.But Garissa county commissioner James Kianda disputed the militants' claims, saying a comprehensive report will be issued today. Investigations are at an advanced stage and sooner, rather than later, Kenyans will be told the truth of what really transpired on that particular day, he told the Star. What we will not accept is a few individuals to come and attack us on our soil and do all manner of evil things. We'll make sure we do away with such characters. A senior security official, who spoke to the Star on conditions of anonymity, said some sugar smugglers who were uncomfortable with the presence of the camp in the area were directly involved in the attack. They saw the presence of the officers at the camp as an impediment to their illegal business. And so the only thing to do is get some gunmen from across to attack the station, he said.
