Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has dismissed the governors who recently defected from Cord to the Jubilee Party, saying they did so out of greed.In an interview with the Star after appearing on Radio Jambo s morning show, Rutto said it was the worst decision.Cord governors Ukur Yattani (Marsabit) and Salim Mvurya (Kwale) have declared they will work with JP to push for President Uhuru Kenyatta s 2017 reelection. If you are a head of a county government, how do you defect? It is the most backward way of thinking an individual could ever imagine, Rutto said.Tana River Governor Hussein Dado, another Cord leader, is also interested in working with JP.Rutto said the governors proclamations of allegiance to Jubilee were informed by lack of political experience.Rutto and his Meru counterpart Peter Munya are some of the Jubilee governors who have fallen out with it.The Bomet governor has accused Jubilee of poor leadership.He has formed his Chama Cha Mashinani party, on which he intends to run in 2017Munya, until recently, planned on using a PNU ticket to seek reelection before the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal approved its dissolution to join JP.Though the governors said they need to support the national government to promote development in their counties, Rutto disagreed. It is not the business of a governor to support the national government, but rather, improve services for the people who elected him, he said.Rutto said county heads do not have to support Jubilee to get development because the governors already have devolved funds.He said the treasury does not disburse funds based on who supports Jubilee. However, Rutto said if Jubilee had a sound ideology, he would support it.
