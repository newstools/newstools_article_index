Businessman Hassan Maalim, nicknamed Willy, on Wednesday threatened journalists of dire consequences for taking his pictures.The journalists were covering proceedings of the Cianda Shopping Mall ownership dispute at Milimani law court.The mall is located at the junction of Mfangano and Ronald Ngala streets, Nairobi.Maalim walked out of court and confronted several journalists, shouting at them to stop taking his pictures."Why are you taking my pictures? I will deal with you," he said.However, several lawyers pulled him aside and told him that since he had agreed to go to court, he has to let journalists take photos.He was advised that the matter is of public interest."Once you are here, you allowed yourself to go before a court of law and everything here is public here," one of the lawyers told Maalim."Do not threaten journalists who are simply doing their job. If you do not want publicity, you should have chosen to stay away," the lawyer said.The case was filed by businessman Ibrahim Surrow, who claimed in his submissions, of a breach of a shareholders agreement.Surrow accused Maalim and another partner Adan Abdi of attempting to defraud one of the companies that owns the block.He states that the shares of Gravet company, an associate of Guled Housing company, were almost transferred to third parties.The two had initially agreed on 45 and 55 per cent shareholding respectively.The row over the two plots, registered as LR numbers 209/798 and 209/6497 on which the mall stands, started on July 1, 2008.The two companies jointly secured Sh250 million to buy the plot from the late businessman and former cabinet minister Njenga Karume.But they have failed to agree on what each of them should control in the joint venture.The businessman was represented by lawyers Fred Ngatia and Issa Mansur.Read: Businessmen fight over city Shopping MallAlso read: Judge Warsame denies links to Cianda Mall ownership
