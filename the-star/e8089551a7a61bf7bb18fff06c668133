The database showed 121 Kenyans were killed by police in the first eight months of 2016, compared to 114 in the same period last year.However, there has been lack of information on the said police killings through the media.This has made the police force justify killings and denying impunity is a problem.In June, hundreds of Kenyans demonstrated after human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and their driver were shot dead after suing the police over a shooting.Kenyan officials did not respond to questions about the number of cases submitted to or investigated by the country's police oversight body that was set up in 2012. A senior police officer at Vigilance House on Monday disputed the numbers of victims of shootings as highlighted in the report.The officer claimed the figures are wrong and are aimed at tainting the force's image."We will issue a statement on the reality of the situation. We always get crime related cases and cannot deny there are criminals among the people," he said.
