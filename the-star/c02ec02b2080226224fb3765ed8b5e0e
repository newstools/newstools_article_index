More than 600 pupils from Tilak Primary School in Kapenguria constituency have been forced to learn under trees after the Health ministry ordered demolition of all 11 mud-walled classrooms.In a letter seen by the Star, the school was on Wednesday given 24 hours notice that the structures would be demolished. You are required to pull down all mud-walled premises and provide alternative safe classrooms and improve storm water drainage flow. The classrooms to be built must adhere to public health rules, the letter read in part.Head teacher Vincent Onek yesterday said 11 classrooms were demolished. This term is short so we have been forced to learn under trees to ensure our pupils prepare for exams, he said. Onek said parents agreed to the arrangement. We do not have many trees in the school compound so some student have to learn in open air. It is very cold in the morning and younger students find it hard to cope. Students in upper primary are forced to study in the hot sun, he said.The school has 1,300 pupils. Onek urged the government to increase infrastructure funds allocated to public primary schools. I know county governments are not supposed to set up structures in schools, but they have disaster funds that they can help us sort out the situation, he said. Parent Emmanuel Rotich urged well-wishers to donate cash to build permanent structures. We have no place to take our children. That s why I am asking well-wishers to help us build modern classrooms, he said.Student president Millicent Marion said girls are suffering because there are not enough toilets.
