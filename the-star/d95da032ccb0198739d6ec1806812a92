Kenyans on Twitter have asked Cord leader Raila Odinga to deliver them from those eating meat in government as they salivate.They said this in reaction to Raila's post on the social media platform on Thursday."Consulting with my brother (Kalonzo Musyoka) earlier. We reaffirm the unity of our coalition to deliver democracy and reforms to the Kenyan people," he wrote.The opposition leader was asked to ensure this comes to pass and not to let his coalition break.Cord co-principals Raila, Kalonzo (Wiper) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) have all declared that they will vie for the presidency in the August 2017 general election.This has sparked speculation on division but the three have assured the public that they will pick a flag bearer and get Jubilee Party out of power.Read: Cord to pick flagbearer in JanuaryAlso read: I will beat you hands down, Raila tells Uhuru after ODM endorsement for president"(Raila, Kalonzo), deliver us from the meat eaters," said Twitter user Nyakundi Julius.The long-running 'meat eating' joke arose from President Uhuru Kenyatta's criticism of the opposition at the funeral of Maasai community leader William Ntimama on September 14.Uhuru told Raila to "leave Jubilee alone" and fix his party ahead of 2017 elections.Raila had earlier said Jubilee Party had two hands; one that makes Kenyans suffer and another geared towards development."Wachana na nyumba yangu ya Jubilee. Nyinyi mkitafuta sisi tumekalia. Endeleeni kumezea nyama mate sisi tukila nyama," Uhuru said in Kiswahili.This loosely translates to: "Leave my Jubilee house alone. As you search we are on the seat.

"Please internalise your differences and let's vote for Cord six-piece," he said.He was referring to the six-piece voting that Raila had proposed but Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale rejected saying they will not allow it.The style of voting will see people select candidates from one party for the positions of president, governor, senator, woman representative, MP and MCA.Khalwale said Kakamega residents will vote for Wetang'ula and other candidates from the party.
