Murang a residents have warned Governor Mwangi Wairia against using county assets in his reelection campaign. They accused the administration of promoting the governor s candidacy by branding county vehicles with his image. Most vehicles have photos of the governor on them. He should not allow that because county assets are not private property, resident Joshua Wamae said. The President himself does not have his photos on government vehicles. It s unconstitutional and unnecessary. I believe if one wants to market himself, there are better and lawful ways to do it. Business consultant Macharia wa Mwihaki said it is wrong to use the vehicles for personal gain. Those vehicles do not belong to the governor.It would be nice to know the reason behind the branding and its significance to Murang a residents. he said. The residents feel Wairia is pursuing self-interest at their expense. Efforts to reach the governor or his office were unsuccessful. Calls and messages went unanswered.
