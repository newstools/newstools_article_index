The Nairobi government has remained silent after the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital was burglaried and medical records stolen. Staff at the hospital said on Tuesday night, unknown people broke into the procurement office and stole medical records. Health CEC Bernard Muia and superintendent Musa Mohamed were reluctant to speak to the Star.The two said they are not aware of the raid and they needed time to get more information. A source, who requested anonymity, said the people who broke into the office targeted medical records, procurement vouchers and receipts. There is a new procurement officer posted to the hospital two months ago. The officer was based at City Hall and the former occupant, who was transferred, did not want to leave. We suspect the former office holder had something to hide and must be the key suspect, the source said.
