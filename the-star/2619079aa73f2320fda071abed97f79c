The Health ministry is conducting a crackdown to revoke licences of institutions that sell sanitation facilities to members of the public.Director of Public Health Kepha Mobacho said this as he urged county governments to put in place mechanisms to encourage good sanitation and hygiene in facilities used by the public."All public and private institutions must have toilets. Some supermarkets sell the facility to their own customers [and] if they want to run the business of toilets, they should stop selling other products to clients," he said.The director was speaking during Global Hand Washing day in Nakuru on Saturday.He emphasised the importance of washing hands effectively and consistently, especially after using the toilet and before contact with food."Diarrhoea and pneumonia kill an estimated 1.7 million children every year globally; many of the deaths can be prevented by hand washing with soap, he said.He said this year, the ministry intends to reach more than half a million children countrywise to demonstrate the importance of washing hands with soap. County governments to put up mechanisms of scaling up hand wash facilities in public places such as health facilities, schools, market places, bus stops and monitor the progress on quarterly basis, he said.He further directed all proprietors of public and private buildings, schools, government institutions and health facilities to put in place mechanisms geared towards promotion of hand washing with soap.UNICEF wash specialist Shiva Singh also said the Education ministry and its stakeholders should promote hygiene in schools to curb the spread of infections."Kenya is among countries that record high cases of diarrhoea, pneumonia hence can easily be prevented by observing good sanitation," Singh said.
