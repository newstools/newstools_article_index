Kenya is finalising the process of developing a policy and strategy to address emerging issues associated with nuclear power use, Energy CS Charles Keter has said.Keter said on Tuesday that the country has made steadfast progress in the development of its legal and regulatory framework for the nuclear power programme.The policy is, among other things, aimed at addressing radiation safety. He said the National Energy Policy that formally introduces nuclear into the energy mix was adopted by the Cabinet in September 2015. The Energy Bill 2016 which seeks to legislate the Nuclear Energy Programme Implementing Organisation (NEPIO), has been passed by Parliament, he said.More on this: Energy Bill awaits President s signature after legislators passed it yesterdayKeter said the accession to the Convention on Nuclear Safety is being reviewed by the Cabinet for considerationHe said efforts were being made to placing Kenya as a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety adding that the country is in the process of finalising the Draft Nuclear Regulatory Bill 2016.The CS was addressing the 60th Regular Session of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria.

Energy is an important prerequisite to achieve the long-term development agenda for the country and has been recognized as an economic driver in Kenya s development blue print." He said Kenya would continue to work closely with the agency in enabling countries to undertake objective energy planning to meet future energy requirements.Keter said the energy planning process in the country has resulted in the need for inclusion of nuclear energy in the country s energy strategy. Kenya acknowledges the central role played by the Agency in promoting international cooperation including its efforts to strengthen the global regime on the peaceful use of nuclear applications, nuclear safety, security and safeguards, said Keter.Read: Viability of Kenya's nuclear plant divides opinion
