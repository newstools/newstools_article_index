Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwamba yesterday said he will run for President in 2022.He said if elected, he will ensure equitable distribution of national resources. Namwamba also said he will fight corruption and promote education. He spoke at the Busia Youth Polytechnic during another party launch. Namwamba said his party is the only political outfit that will improve lives.The Budalang i MP said LPK, sometimes called the third force , is a national party, whose agenda is to preach peace and unity. He said LPK leaders do not preach tribal politics and are drawn from all corners of the country, contrary to critics claims. The former ODM secretary general accused the Busia government of failing to address important issues affecting health workers at the Busia County Referral Hospital.The health workers went on strike on Tuesday to protest delayed promotions, despite assurances from the county government. He urged other Luhya leaders to join his party. He appealed to Ford Kenya leader and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang ula, Musalia Mudavadi of ANC and Cyrus Jirongo.Namwamba was accompanied by party chairperson Julia Ojiambo, secretary general David Makali, organising secretary Peter ole Musei and deputy party leader Esther Kondo. After he quit ODM, Namwamba was criticised as an absentee leader whose heart was not involved.ODM professional Edwin Sifuna said Namwamba should be told in clear terms that a leadership that does not exist cannot be undermined. Last month, Namwamba said he quit his secretary general position because of party mismanagement.He also said political rivalry does not and must never amount to enmity.
