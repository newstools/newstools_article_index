Former EACC chairman Philip Kinisu's Esaki Ltd received Sh2.9 million from the Devolution ministry in June when in office.A committee of parliament probing the NYS scandal was told on Thursday that Esaki received Sh54.3 million from the service.CEO Halakhe Waqo revealed this when he faced members of the National Assembly's Public Accounts committee (PAC). The EACC official added that he only played his role as a whistle blower and was not involved in any approval of the said funds."My password was hacked and its only afterward that I realised that my approval had been used and was being coerced not to follow up on this issue," Waqo said.He said files with findings of ongoing investigations by multi-agency team on the matter will be forwarded to DPP."The National Youth Service actually lost Sh1.8bn in the NYS scandal and not Sh791million, so lifestyle audit is underway on key suspects," he said.On Wednesday, he accused his former bosses Principal Secretary Peter Mangiti and ex-National Youth Service Director General Nelson Githinji of allegedly playing roles in a scheme to defraud the National Youth Service (NYS) of Sh695 million.
