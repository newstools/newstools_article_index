The President of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) Leandro Negre has called on the Kenya government to invest more in the game to restore it to its glory days.Negre, speaking at the Sikh Union Club Nairobi on Monday as he opened the hockey section of the club s Mahan Hall of Fame, said more financial backing would ensure the country record s impressive results in a sport it once dominated.The Mahan Hall of Fame is a tribute to all the Kenya players who featured in the Olympic and World Cup over the years.The FIH president s sentiments come in the backdrop of Kenya teams failing to qualify for the World League Series Two at the just ended World League One series in Accra, Ghana.Kenya men s and women s teams finished second behind Ghanaian teams and will now rely on next year s African Continental qualifiers to reach the World Cup. In previous years, Kenya was a force to reckon with in hockey. I believe with the right investment and support Kenya can achieve great results. It goes without saying that football is and remains a popular sport in Kejnya but with good funding hockey can match the popularity, said Negre.The FIH President also lauded the Sikhs impact in the growth of the sport in the country. Sikhs have written their names in the country s history by giving a lot to hockey and more should be done to ensure the memories are treasured.
