A man who served in high office during President Mwai Kibaki's first term told me once how he and a few other influential leaders tried to have the 2007 general election postponed.What happened is that given their positions in the Kibaki administration they were well aware of two things.First, that there was the very real prospect Kibaki would lose the election. But this is not what troubled them the most. The real horror they wished to avoid was that of the looming explosion of violence in the Rift Valley, which they had been warned to expect by the Intelligence services, and which was likely to target their own Kikuyu community.So they sought an audience with President Kibaki and suggested to him that, for reasons concerning his hopes for reelection, but also the peace of the nation as a whole, the 2007 election should be postponed.President Kibaki did not even pause to think about it, before he dismissed the idea.And with good reason: As a veteran of Kenyan politics, who served in Parliament continuously for five decades before retiring, Kibaki knew very well that this was a path which the nation should not go down.One of the things that has for all these decades provided a much-needed safety valve for the Kenyan people is that, every five years, without fail, they have had the opportunity to decide who will lead them.For the first 30 years or so (1963 to 1991), they only had a voice in determining who their next MP would be. The presidency was generally held very firmly in the iron grip of the serving president, and there was no question of a contested presidential election.But from 1992 onwards, even the imperial presidency was open to electoral challenge, and not only did some of President Daniel Moi's former ministers run against him, but even the most obscure of Kenyans, if they only got the requisite number of signatures on their forms, could run for president.And not once was there a postponement of a general election, because there was an anticipation of violence, or for any other reason. The 1983 election was in fact held earlier, in the face of the Charles Njonjo crisis.The one constant of Kenyan political life that must be retained is that the date of the next general election cannot be pushed back.
