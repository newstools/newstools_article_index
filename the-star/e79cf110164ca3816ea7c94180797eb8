Champions Gor Mahia have found their form at just the right time, reinvigorating their hopes of clinch a record setting fourth successive league crown.Tomorrow, Ze Maria s charges will face off with relegation-threatened former champions Sofapaka, hoping to stay in touch with league leaders Tusker.K Ogallo have won two difficult games on the bounce with one-time crowd favourite George Odhaimbo turning back the hands of time with goals that have resurrected Gor s hopes of retaining the title they have made their own for the past three years.Odhiambo will be expected to once again feature in the three-prong attack that includes Rwandan duo of Medie Kagere and Jacques Tuyisenge.Tuyisenge in particular, will be keen to add to his eight goals for the campaign but like many of his teammates, helping the team get three points will be of primary concern.Today, though Ulinzi Stars Sportpesa Premier League title hopes all but disappeared with the damaging defeat to Gor last week but they will be keen to stay in the race mathematically with three points from a difficult trip to face Chemelil Sugar in Kisumu County.Both sides will be withoutkey players with the soldiers set to miss defender Mohamed Hassan, who was sent off in the ill tempered defeat to the champions while Chemelil will be without midfield anchorman David Ojuang, who has accumulated five yellow card.Tireless Kakamega Homeboyz defender Charles Momanyi has returned to club after honouring his first national team call up, and talk is that he will be conferred the captain s armband for the remainder of the season.Momanyi will be tasked with keeping the likes of lively Heritier Luvualu and Roosevelt Blatty of Ushuru silent as Homeboyz seek to avenge the 1-0 defeat they suffered against the taxmen in the first leg.Ushuru have not won a match in their last eight outings certainly an ignominious record they will want to snap. AFC Leopards push for a top eight finish will continue with a difficult match against Western Stima tomorrow hours after Mathare United take on hard to beat Posta Rangers.
