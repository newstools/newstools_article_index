Some Nairobi residents have threatened to march to Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company offices over "persistent" water interruptions in their estates.They say their taps have remained dry days after the company completed maintenance works. Last week the county shut the Ngethu treatment plant for maintenance.Umoja One and Two, Dandora Phase 1, Donholm, Buru Buru Phase 4, South B and other Eastlands estates have been without water since Thursday last week. We expected water to have been restored by Saturday morning but our taps are still dry. We do not know whether to buy water or food. It is even worse for us because vendors now have increased the price of water, which makes it hard for poor families, resident John Wambua said.He said they are spending a lot of money buying water from vendors.NCWSC corporate affairs manager Mbaruku Vyakweli said water supply was restored last Saturday after the completion of the maintenance."Normally, after maintenance, there are normally some airlocks on the pipes but this takes less than a day. So let them contact us," he said.
