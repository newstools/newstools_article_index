Taita Taveta communities have criticised the County Public Service Board for employing under-qualified health personnel. In a social media forum called Taita Taveta group, members said the county employs nurses with certificates instead of diplomas. How can they send someone underqualified to head a station like Mpizinyi and at the same time take care of patients? This raises an issue of integrity," a resident said. The three nurses operate in Wesu, Saghaighu and Moi.Health executive Gifton Mkaya dismissed the allegations. We have hospital management teams that can assist you get the information you want. See the medical superintendents of the hospital concerned and get all the details you want, he said.
