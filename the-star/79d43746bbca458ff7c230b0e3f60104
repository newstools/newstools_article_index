South Mugirango MP Manson Nyamweya joined legislators pushing for Kisii unity, but said their frequent visits to State House are for selfish interests . It is not the role of the President to allocate resources. The budget is done in Parliament, not at State House, he said.Nyamweya attended the caucus second funds drive in Bomachoge Chache.But Kisii Senator Chris Obure and Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi said the State House trips are purely for development. Let him come out clean and tell us if he was paid to attend that meeting. He should stop tarnishing our names by claiming that we were paid to go to State House... We will continue to engage every stakeholder, Obure said.Angwenyi said, We are going to State House again in two weeks. We will not force him to join [us]... Kisiis have decided to work with the government and we will not allow a few people to distract us.
