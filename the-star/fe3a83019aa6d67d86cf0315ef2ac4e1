ODM members who defected to the Jubilee Party will face the party s disciplinary committee on Friday.Committee chairman Fred Athuok told the Star they will hear each of the 13 leaders, including two governors, independently. We have summoned them for Friday at the headquarters in the morning... They will come in one-by-one. It s a straight forward issue either you have defected or not, the lawyer said yesterday.ODM has threatened to kick out the defectors in what might trigger unprecedented by-elections with only 10 months to the 2017 general election.Athuok said all the 13 leaders responded, despite initially saying they will ignore the show cause warning.They include Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani, his Kwale counterpart Salim Mvurya and Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga.Others are Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Mathare MP Steven Kariuki, Gideon Mung aro (Kilifi), Isaac Mwaura (nominated) and James Rege (Karachuonyo).Athuok said the seven-day window to Budalang i MP Ababu Namwamba and Likoni MP Masoud Mwahima has not elapsed. The two will be summoned at a later date, he said.However, some of the targeted MPs have accused ODM of dishonesty in the purge, saying Raila and the Orange Party have also been receiving defectors.
