Plans are underway by top government officials to ensure IEBC commissioners do not leave office as expected, Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba has said.On Thursday, the MP said the government is not willing to fast-track the exit packages of the commissioners. The delay in bringing in new commissioners will automatically postpone the election date or force the current commissioners to oversee the election, Bedzimba said. We shall not allow the commissioners to oversee the election nor would we allow the election date to be postponed, he said. Bedzimba issued bursary cheques worth Sh26 million to Kisauni students at Mtopanga Primary School.
