My dad was an air force pilot, so I developed a passion for flying planes and, after clearing high school at Lukenya Boys, I joined an aviation flight school at Wilson airport. I am now a full-fledged pilot with more than 100 hours of flight time. Taking lessons under guidance from an instructor and to feel the rush when you re handed the controls while airborne is the best feeling I have had and continue having. Learning to fly a plane or helicopter will give you a truly unforgettable experience.My second passion is music, which I inherited from my grandfather, who was an entertainer back in the 1960s.0500 HRSMy day starts with breakfast, before heading to Wilson Airport with my flight instructor Captain Ben Wamalwa. We take the skies for an hour or two to learn new skills or emergency procedures and then head for lunch. 0800 HRSI get to JKUAT Karen for morning classes, where I m pursuing a bachelor of commerce degree in finance. 1200 HRSI spend time socialising and exchanging new ideas with colleagues. After my favourite chapati and beef lunch, I play basketball with the campus team. 1400 HRSI spend the afternoon at Young Dreamers studios at Nairobi West, where we work on new music with my extremely talented rap buddies: Bruno Kips, Coogi VI, Lyon and The Pharaoh. I work with several producers, my favourite being Richie G from ATL entertainment. We are currently working on a single called Goosebumps.1600 HRS My work at Jeff Hamilton, a security company starts. I am engaged as the online sales manager.WEEKENDSMy rap partner Lyon, who is my childhood friend, and I hit the clubs in Nairobi for a performance, leisure or business. When im not performing, I prefer quiet weekends at home and ordinarily join family for church service at Mavuno. I prepare for my week ahead so that by Sunday evening, my schdeule is already done. Taking time to relax is also important for me as a music writer, so sometimes I get away from all the social buzz.
