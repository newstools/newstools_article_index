More than 2,500 medical laboratory students seeking registration have been rejected by the Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board in two years.Chairman Abel Onyango said 2,000 completed studies but were not recogised by the board.The remaining 500 had been admitted by both private and public institutions without meeting the minimum requirements. The board s attention has been drawn to the continued non-compliance by some institutions flouting statutory entry requiremens, he said. This has resulted in irregular admission of unqualified students to some institutions. At a press conference in Nairobi yesterday, Onyango said some institutions have doctored letters claiming the board has lowered the minimum entry requirements and are using them to defraud students and parents. Kenya has not run short of qualified students interested in medical lab sciences to justify some colleges targeting unqualified students for admission, he said. The chairman said the board will withdraw the programme from some institutions, especially private colleges, that lack the necessary infrastructure, equipment and staff. We recently concluded an audit of all the institutions offering this programme and we realised some do not have enough lecturers, while others are over-admitting students, Onyango said. All public and private universities offer the programme at degree level and 30 private colleges offer diplomas.In 2014, the board abolished the training of medical lab technicians at certificate level to improve quality.
