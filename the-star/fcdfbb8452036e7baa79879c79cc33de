Four Nairobi governor aspirants traded accusations during a live TV debate on Wednesday night.They were Adopt a Light CEO Esther Passaris, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, former Cord leader Raila Odinga's aide Miguna Miguna and former Nairobi town clerk Philip Kisia.They appeared on the JKL Live show hosted by Jeff Koinange on KTN.Miguna accused Wanjiru of corruption when she was Housing assistant minister.He said Wanjiru is not fit to be governor because she was allocated several government houses in the city.Wanjiru denied the allegations, saying she will sue Miguna.She told him Miguna he has nothing to offer Nairobi residents except the "good talk".Miguna took a swipe at Governor Evans Kidero, saying he is the most corrupt leader, who doesn't have the interests of the common man at heart."Once I get into office, I will ensure Kidero, the biggest thief, is arrested and jailed. I will weed out corruption at City Hall," he said.Miguna said Kisia left the city in a mess and was amonginept leaders at City Hall.Wanjiru said if elected, she will clean up the city. She said she will engage youth in weekly clean-ups.Wanjiru said she left ODM because Kidero rigged her out in 2013."I will not be any one's running mate, no matter what. They can be my running mates but I will not play second fiddle to Sonko or Sakaja," she said.Passaris said she has been tested and tried. She said she lit up Nairobi and worked hard to rehabilitate slum children.Kisia accused Kidero of borrowing too much, adding that the county owes its creditors Sh42 billion. He said it will be difficult to repay the cash.Kisia defended his record at City Hall, saying he initiated the ICT strategy that has improved revenue collection."Kidero is only implementing what I started. I was the brainchild of the e-payment system that he is bragging about. I started the asset management initiative. I also pushed for the start of the integrated solid waste management, which has stalled," he said.The four said despite the fact they were in ODM, they will never go back because they were conned by the party.
