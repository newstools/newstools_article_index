Kisii MCAs who claimed sitting allowance while on maternity leave have been asked to refund the money. EACC deputy secretary Michael Mubea said in September, October and November 2015 all members were paid maximum sitting allowance yet some were on maternity leave.He spoke in the Kisii assembly chamber during the official presentation of the Corruption Risk Assessment reports for the county executive and county assembly. Mubea said payments were included in the payroll before the end of the month.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission CEO said the team that compiled the reports found registers with inconsistent signatures used to support payments. Corruption and bribery are alive in both the county executive and assembly procurement departments, he said.
