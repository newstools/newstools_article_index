Nairobi county government has automated the process of regularising all buildings in the City.City Hall announced on Thursday that residents have until the September 15 to regularise their buildings or they will be brought down.Jambo Pay has been charged with collecting revenue electronically for City Hall.CEO Danson Muchemi said this will boost revenue collection for City Hall since many more people will be paying rates.The regularisation of development was brought about to curb the issue of collapsing buildings in the City.The Bill was tabled and passed in Nairobi County Assembly in 2014.It seeks to ensure that all buildings are safe for occupation.In-cases where buildings do not have lifts, ramps for the disabled, and do not generally meet safety standards, the Bill requires that the owners of the buildings make adjustments to the buildings with City Halls approval.Once regularised, building owners are put into the valuation roll and start paying rates.Speaking to the Star on phone, deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke, who is the chair of the regularisation process, said that City Hall introduced the online payments so that residents can make payments at their convenient time and latter submit hard copies of their drawings to City Hall.He said that the regularisation will help land buying companies and residents get a chance to have a title deed."Once residents have title deeds, they will be able to use them as security and thus will be able to carry out more development activities," Mueke said.But the deputy Governor said that City Hall is still facing many challenges and that residents are still sceptical about the regularisation process."Some cannot believe that City Hall has changed and our aim is to serve them. They still live in the past but this has to change," he said.
