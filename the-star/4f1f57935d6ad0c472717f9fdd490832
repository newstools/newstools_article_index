The Uasin Gishu government has suspended construction of a mortuary within an estate on the outskirts of Eldoret town after residents protested against it last week.On Monday, developer, property owners, some residents and county lands officers held a three-hour meeting to resolve the standoff. Physical Planning CEC Robert Ngisirei directed that the construction be halted, pending public participation and environmental impact assessment.The county committee had initially approved the project, but residents said they were not consulted. All parties have agreed that public participation be carried out first. That s why we have stopped the project, Ngisirei said.Hundreds of protesting residents criticised the county for allowing construction of a morgue in a residential area. They warned the county to act, or else they will pull it down.
