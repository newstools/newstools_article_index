Mama Sarah Obama will be among heroines to be feted by the government on Mashujaa Day in Machakos, a CS has said.Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugune Wamalwa said Sarah will be honoured for her contribution towards supporting orphans and vulnerable children.Wamalwa said the father of the US President, Barack Obama Senior, will feature in the list of those to be recognised in the event, to be attended by President Uhuru Kenyatta.The CS spoke on Saturday at Senator Barack Obama Primary School, Kogelo village, Siaya.He launched a Sh2.1 billion water project supported by the African Development Bank and the government.Wamalwa said Nyanza is home to distinguished leaders who have contributed to the country s first and second liberation.He cited freedom fighter Achieng Oneko,Cord leader Raila Odinga and Siaya Senator James Orengo. Orengo was my teacher when I was pursuing my law degree, Wamalwa said.The CS said it is necessary to invest in the region s education to revive academic glory. We need to invest a lot in education so that we can produce the likes of President Obama, Wamalwa said.He was with Mama Sarah, former minister and Lake Victoria South Water Services company chairman John Koech and Siaya Deputy Governor Ouma Onyango.Mama Sarah asked the government to support her foundation in taking care of orphans who cannot access basic education.Last month, the Bamburi Cement Company signed an accord with the Mama Sarah Obama Foundation to construct an Early Childhood Development and Education centre in Kogelo, Siaya.The centre helps more than 1,000 orphans and children from impoverished families. Construction started on September 14, the company said.The foundation has ensured health literacy for out-of-school adolescent mothers. It provides prevention education for boys and girls on gender and HIV-Aids in Siaya. Wamalwa added that Uhuru will visit Nyanza in a few weeks to commission water projects expected to benefit more than 190,000 Siaya residents.He said the President will also commission the Siaya-Bondo water project, among others.Onyango praised the project, saying it will end the perennial water shortage.He urged the government to extend the scope of beneficiaries to include all county residents.
