Ezekiel Mutua, CEO of the Kenya Film Classification Board, has promised to go back to the drawing board after furious reaction to his consultative bill to dramatically increase KFCB powers.The bill proposes that the KFCB authorise all programmes and advertisements in watershed and non-watershed times. Internet providers will have to accept KFCB authority over their content. It will authorise all outdoor billboards and monitor all print publications, both local and foreign. And if any content is ethnically divisive, the KPCB will pursue it.With this bill the KFCB is hijacking authority from the Media Council, Communication Authority and the National Integration and Cohesion Commission. This is a blatant power grab.Mutua should not go back to the drawing board. He, or his superiors, should completely scrap this attempted seizure of power. The KFCB should stick to classifying films as its title proposes. It should leave everything else to more competent and appropriate authorities.Quote of the day: "You can tell whether a man is clever by his answers.
