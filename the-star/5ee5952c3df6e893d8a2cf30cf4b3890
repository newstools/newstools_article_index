Despite reported cases of mega corruption in counties, governors have said devolution has had positive achievements since its inception in 2013.The 47 counties have so far received approximately Sh1.3 trillion for both recurrent and and development expenditure. On Friday last week, Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya said there is positive change in all the devolved functions.Addressed journalist at Parliament Buildings after appearing before the Senate Public Accounts Committee, he admitted there are cases of corruption in the counties. "Since the advent of devolution, there is evidence to show the people have experienced a lot of positive change, especially in service delivery. Health services are more accessible in the rural areas and more affordable," Munya said.He said the county governments have built 1,566 new health centres and dispensaries, which now number to 10,032 from 8,466 in 2012.The CoG chairman, who is also the Meru Governor, said the devolved units have employed 428 new doctors and 2,283 nurses ."In 2013, there were 874 doctors and 6,620 nurses. The statics today stand at 1,302 doctors and 8,903 nurses in the county facilities," Munya said.He said infant mortality rate has dropped to 39 per cent in every 1,000 live births, as opposed to 62 per cent before devolution.On the agriculture sector, Munya said there is a huge increase in crop and livestock production.He said 541,627 farmers now have access to agricultural extension services."Some 132 value addition projects have been instituted in 34 counties and 1,021 greenhouses installed in 36 counties. A total of 911 cattle dips have been constructed and rehabilitated in 29 counties," Munya said.He also said the county governments have witnessed a 21 per cent increase in enrolment of pupils in the early childhood development centres.Munya said in 2013, enrolment in the centres was 1,691,286 but has increased to 2,074,060 pupils.He said the counties have recruited 30,049 teachers and assistants "to cater for increase in enrolment"."The county governments have refurbished more than 598 centres, built more than 5,951 ECD centres and equipped them with desks to ensure pre-school children learn in a conducive environment," Munya said.On roads, he said between 2013 and 2016, the county governments have tarmacked 379km and constructed another 35,934km of all-weather roads.Munya said the counties have also opened up 19,148km of new roads, while another 9,572km have been rehabilitated.On trade, he said counties have constructed 289 new markets. This brings the total of markets to 651 from 362 in 2013.Munya also said in 2013, there were only 1,396 cooperatives but have since grown to 1,806 with a turn over of Sh56 billion."The cooperatives societies are now employing more than 300,000 people," he said.
