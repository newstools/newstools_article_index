The High Court yesterday ruled that TNA secretary general Onyango Oloo should give up one of his posts.He is the chairman of the Lake Basin Development Authority. Justice Isaac Lenaola said, After submissions, I have indeed confirmed that holding the two posts is against the constitution. The judgement was however overtaken by events because TNA has folded up into the Jubilee Party.Oloo is also no longer the LBDA chairman. The chairman is Zablon Olang. The suit was filed in 2014 by TNA member Rogers Mugusu who sought orders to have Oloo removed from the secretary general position for being a state officer. Oloo said there was no law that bars him from holding a party position as well as serving as chairman of a state corporation.
