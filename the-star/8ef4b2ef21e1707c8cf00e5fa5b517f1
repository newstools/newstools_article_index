Malindi residents yesterday ignored World Tourism Day celebrations, saying they were not consulted by the authorities about planning.Angry youths protested against the move, saying it left them looking like strangers in their own land. Residents said they were locked out of the event by organisers and found out that outsiders were the ones doing everything. The event is key in promoting tourism. Residents and sector players said it flopped because of poor planning and lack of proper communication.Some exhibition stands were empty while those occupied had few guests. Shella residents said they found tents being pitched on Monday by strangers. Resident Jamal Shehe blamed Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi for sidelining the Malindi people. We are not happy to host World Tourism Day organised and implemented by strangers, no local has been involved. This is not right and Kingi should not repeat it, he said. The chief guest was Tourism PS Fatuma Mohamed. She said mobilisation was the responsibility of the county.
