A section Kajiado residents engaged police in running battles on Monday following protests against the fencing off of their property for use in SGR construction.The group had been compensated billions of shillings to facilitate the construction of the line from Sultan Hamud to Konza in Kajiado.Most of them, largely drawn from Arroi and Kima, claimed they were coerced to accept the monies and that some of the plots were not voluntarily surrendered.The farmers cried foul that the aspect of fencing off the railway line was not part of the initial agreement with Kenya Railways.They said that the fencing of SGR line is threatening closure of some schools and other amenities including boreholes that are sources of water for livestock and domestic use.Residents of Sultan Hamud during demonstrations against the fencing off of SGR route. /KURGAT MARINDANY Meshack ole Wuasi, one of those compensated for use of their plots, said the government promised to build underpasses, water pans but did not share any of the plans for the fence."This was a compulsory acquisition and we had to accept after the government pledged to compensate us," Wuasi said.He further claimed that before the flagship project started, area residents used an old road to Sultan Hamud town that ran parallel with the old railway line.The path, he said, would take them a few minutes to access the facilities that have now been rendered inaccessible owing to the fence being put up by the SGR contractors."They promised us heaven but we are now starting to see red, and we feel cheated. Our children cannot access schools across this giant SGR," Wuasi said."Our cows cannot cross over to water points on the other side. We are demanding that the government keeps its word on protecting our rights," he said.The underpasses that have been provided by SGR, according to Wuasi, are waterways that cannot be used for domestic purposes during rains seasons.He said Ilmao Primary School in Arroi location, Mashuuru sub-county, is threatened with closure because the SGR fence has locked out many pupils.Wuasi said residents will be forced to travel 17 kilometres to move from Arroi to Sultan Hamud, which was initially a journey of 6km before the road was closed.In the initial plans, the county government of Kajiado, KR and the National Land Commission carried out civic education for the thousands of the people who were set to be affected by SGR line.Read: SGR eats into Nairobi National Park in final plan for Nairobi-Naivasha routeThey were trained on how they would cope up with the project passing through their farms and how to invest the billions of shillings they were to be compensated.Mashuuru deputy county commissioner Stephen Nyakundi said the community members had only been incited, hence the problem at Sultan Hamud, Arroi, Kilimbwani and Kima.He pointed an accusing finger at Harrison Tago, a KR liaison officer in the area, for the alleged incitement."It is a problem they have created because when they were receiving compensation from the NLC through KR, they never raised any issue," Nyakundi told the Star on telephone.He advised those not happy with the closure of the property to seek audience with KR instead of blocking roads and delaying a government flagship project.The SGR project is yet to be received by various quarters who feel its designated route poses potential dangers to wildlife.Read: Conservationists up in arms as proposed SGR route eats into Nairobi National ParkAlso read: Kajiado residents protest SGR route through Nairobi national park
