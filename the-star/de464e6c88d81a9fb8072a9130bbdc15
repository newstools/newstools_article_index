A recent study on the status of education in Kilifi county has blamed poor grades on teachers absenteeism. The study done by Uwezo Kenya last year was released on Monday.It says most teachers in public schools are absent almost every day. The study said the trend reduces teacher-student contact, hurting performance.The report was presented during the launch of Twaweza East Africa s Husika campaign aimed at increasing education awareness in the county. It was launched by Education executive Salma Muhiddin in Kilifi town.Twaweza East Africa advocacy manager Brezhenev Otieno and Lucky Mbaga from the Mission for Community Initiative and Development, teachers, chiefs, assistant chiefs and representatives from the Teachers Service Commission were also present. We noticed during the compiling of the report that Malindi subcounty has the highest number of teacher absenteeism cases with 23 per cent, followed by Kaloleni at 15 per cent, Otieno said.Kenya National Union of Teachers Kilifi branch secretary Mwalimu Rasi said understaffing is the major contributor towards poor performance.He said most schools in the county have very few teachers against a high number of pupils. A parent from Kaloleni said the dwindling education standards are attributable to the teachers attitude towards the education of their children. I have seen it in Kaloleni, where teachers are not committed to our children. They are not teaching and some utter discouraging remarks, he said.
