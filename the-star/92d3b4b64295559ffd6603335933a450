The Mombasa government has challenged Senator Hassan Omar to show residents the alleged Sh390 million residence Governor Hassan Joho is putting up for himself.On Monday, Omar said the money was set aside in this year's Sh9.9 billion. The only purchase of a residence, as far as I understand, should be the governor's residence. We all know the governor does not have an official residence, but Sh390 million is a lot of money. Mombasa economy does not allow such waste, he said.Omar said Joho does not need a palace to stay in, when thousands of residents are living in squalor and abject poverty. MCAs yesterday said Omar is fond of maligning Joho s name with cheap propaganda.Omar has severally accused the MCAs of being Joho s rubber stamp, an allegation they have vehemently denied.Finance Committee chairman Mohamed Hatimy said the senator should show Kenyans where in the budget the Sh390 million Joho s residence is indicated. It is an outright lie to tell us Joho plans to put up a Sh390 million palace, he said.Hatimy said Omar is trying in vain to smear Joho s name to win the hearts of Coast residents in his bid for governor.Omar, Joho s friend-turned-foe, has launched a series of attacks of the governor's leadership style, accusing him of not engaging residents in decision making.Hatimy said the budget making process is open and the public was invited to give views.Tononoka MCA Saad Faraj said Omar is making the allegations because "he has already lost Joho". There is a very big political gap between Joho and Omar. The senator cannot stand the fact that he cannot beat Joho. He has resorted to spreading propaganda whenever he gets a platform, he said. We know Joho is a blessed man. He does not need to depend on taxpayers money."
