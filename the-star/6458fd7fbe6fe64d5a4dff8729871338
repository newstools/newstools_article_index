A member of the Homa Bay county assembly service board wants to run for Mbita MP seat. Speaking at Mbita town on Thursday, Judy Kamaria said she will concentrate on improving education and infrastructure. My motivation is the desire to fight defilement, which leads to teenage pregnancies that impede girls education, she said. Kamaria said the constituency may not have productive residents in future if the fight against teen pregnancies is lost. My leadership will ensure no mud classrooms in Mbita, she said. Kamaria said she would promote an inclusive leadership, which consults residents on development matters. She said she would champion legislation and programmes to improve the lives of the fishing community, the majority in Mbita constituency.
