Nairobi Chief Valuer Isaac Nyoike has moved to the High Court to challenge a decision by the Ombudsman to have him removed from office.Through lawyer Ibrahim Aden, he says the Ombudsman has made adverse findings that he has abused his powers as the city s chief valuer.Court documents indicate in August, the CAJ published a report titled The Findings and Recommendations in the Investigation Report of the Commission of Administrative Justice on the Alleged Irregular Allocation of Eastleigh Market to Private Developers .Nyoike says the report not only made adverse findings that he is culpable of abuse of power, but also made recommendation to Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero to have him removed from office on grounds of gross abuse of power and breach of public trust.Nyoike says, however, the Ombudsman failed to take into consideration that the Office of the Chief Valuer is not in any way involved in the registration of the property. He is now seeking to quash the implementation of the findings made by the CAJ.
