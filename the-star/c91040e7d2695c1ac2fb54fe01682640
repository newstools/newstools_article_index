The government could re-advertise the vice chancellor s position at Moi University and hire an independent firm to conduct interviews.This is after some groups urged Education CS Fred Matiang i to cancel interviews held three months ago citing political interference.Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos led Rift Valley politicians in storming the university last week to protest against the appointment of Prof Laban Ayiro as the acting vice chancellor for three months. They want Prof Isaac Kosgey appointed. The legislators said he emerged top during interviews. We are going on well but I hope we will continue to work together so that we move as a university, Ayiro said yesterday as it emerged that the University Council chaired by Prof Jenesio Kimanyario would meet next week to discuss the row over the VC slot.A senior member of the council told the Star that leaking of the results of the recent interviews to the public led to the politicisation of the process. It s now desirable that we just cancel the interviews and give the same work to an independent firm to help recruit a new CEO for the university, he said. He said the position may be re-advertised next month.Mandago has said Rift Valley leaders will only accept a vice chancellor appointed on merit. There has been a strong push to have a Kalenjin to become the vice chancellor. Three academics had been shortlisted for the VC position. They are Moi University deputy VC Kosgey, Rongo University College principal professor Samuel Gudu and historian and professor Ann Nangulu. Nangulu is in charge of quality standards at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa.
