Elgeyo Marakwet MCAs have expressed outrage over the recent killing of two men by forest rangers in Kessup and Embobut forests.They have termed the killings of unarmed suspects of illegal logging by forest rangers as alarming We are asking the police to do a thorough investigation and give a report. It is not right for KFS rangers to kill unarmed persons in the name of protecting trees, deputy speaker Paul Sutter said.Sutter claimed rangers shot dead a middle aged man a week ago in Kewabus, Embobut forest in Marakwet East before leaving his body in the forest where it was found by herders a day after the alleged killing.The deputy speaker spoke on Thursday during a press briefing at the county assembly.An Eldoret-based AP officer was shot dead on Wednesday evening after he was allegedly found transporting timber out of the Kessup forest without a permit.The killing of Sammy Kimutai, 32, sparked violent protests that led to the burning down of a KFS camp in Kapteren, adjacent to the Kessup forest.One suspected illegal logger and a KFS ranger were seriously injured during the 7pm scuffle.KFS commandant Alex Lemarkoko flew to Kessup on Thursday afternoon and warned locals against provoking rangers.Lemarkoko said Kimutai attempted to grab a gun from a ranger as another group attacked the rangers using pangas and stones. Our officers will respond with force if attacked. We are appealing to residents to support KFS in conserving forests, he said.Kimutai s family however said the deceased did not attack the officers as claimed.His uncle Timothy Kimeli appealed to the police to investigate the killing, saying Kimutai may have been killed for a different reason. We still don t know why he was killed. No one has come to tell us the truth. We want justice to be done, Kimeli said.
