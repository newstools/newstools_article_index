Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua yesterday unveiled a comprehensive food sustainability programme to improve agricultural production.The programme will provide farmers with free seeds, fertiliser and tractor services. Mutua said farmers will also receive chicks to improve poultry farming. He spoke at Vyulya market in Mwala subcounty.Mutua distributed seeds and said he is committed to boosting agricultural yield. He said for a long time, Ukambani has suffered the shame of needing food relief due to poor agricultural policies. Many leaders campaign by donating food to their starving constituents and then complain about failed rains,without offering any solutions, Mutua said. Our ongoing programme on free chicks is a great success. He distributed 28,000 kg maize, 17,394kg of beans, 1,878kg of cow peas and 8,718kg of green grams.
