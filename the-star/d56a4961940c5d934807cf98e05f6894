Kenya's top rapper and genge aficionado, Frasha, has began his books drive today. He will be collecting books donated by well wishers at Graffin College on Moi Avenue and Marabou next to Nakumatt Mega, Highway Mall.The P Unit star is known for supporting children with disabilities by providing wheelchairs and a tuktuk to ease their transportation needs.Now, still under his I Am Frasha Foundation, the music act is looking at supporting young minds by finding sustainable ways to build capacity for a Mathare based kids library."We have a planned visit to Slin Kids Library in Mathare on October 1. Currently, we are looking at ways to build the library but before then we need books and toys for the children."Frasha, a graduate himself, appreciates the importance of education and more so a need to develop a strong reading culture among the young.The library was founded by Victor Holvik, a 27 year old orphan, who grew up not having the luxury of books and a space to read."I started Slin Kids Library in Mathare slum almost two years ago. It started with one room and only 20 kids. Right now, I have two rooms and a traffic of more than 300 kids especially on weekends," Victor said, "The biggest problem we face is a lack of books and space."Victor hopes to expand the library that currently houses at least 50 children at a go."When I started, I started with one room which I was paying Sh4,000 rent then I took another one. As we speak we are in talks with the immediate neighbour if she can find another place and give us the next room so we can have three rooms."To best serve the young minds, Victor came up with a strategy."I have to come up with a system where kids can borrow a book and go home with it thus creating a space for another kid to use the library unfortunately, they can't borrow for more than a day because we have very few books. Not forgetting teachers also use the library space for research and setting exams."Victor says the library is a good initiative because, "Since it was opened there has been less cases of unfinished homework among pupils and slight improvement in academics."
