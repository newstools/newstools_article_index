A woman who has been living in the UK for 15 years has spoken of the "nightmare" of having to be deported to Kenya despite having no family in the country.Zeenat Jamal, 43, has lived in the UK since 2001, with with her four sisters who have British passports.They all previously held Kenyan passports but Zeenat has been unable to get the British document despite application.Zeenat said she was detained after her application despite being in a "genuine" relationship with Briton Brooke Gaughan for six years."We met six years ago in London and decided to move to Cardiff in 2012, before settling in Dinas Powys two years ago and my sisters have been living in London," she said.She noted she did not know her application had been rejected until she was detained at Yarl s Wood Immigration Removal Centre and told she would have to be deported.Zeenat added that she was not given the chance to contact her partner on learning she would be deported. I had no idea. We ve been waiting for ages. We were not aware that the application was rejected," she was quoted by the Mirror as saying."I just wanted to call Gaughan because I knew he d be worried. The next thing I knew I was in the detention centre."Zeenat, who has not been back to Kenya for the 15 years, called for intervention in her case as she does not have relatives in Kenya."How am I meant to go back? They plan to deport me yet all my family is in England," she said.One of Zeenat s sisters will travel with her from Heathrow Airport to Nairobi on Monday, while Gaughan plans to fly to the city on Thursday to try finding a solution to the predicament. All her sisters have been granted rights to stay so we feel it is an absolute nightmare, so unfair. She s got no family," he said.The Foreign Affairs ministry said it had not received communication from England over Zeenat's deportation but would hep if the matter was brought before them."We have not received any communication by our Britain counterparts so we will wait and help should the case be brought forward," spokesperson Edwin Limo said.Anyone seeking to become a UK citizen must have lived there for at least five years, not broken any immigration laws while there and spent at most 450 days outside the country in the period, or 90 days in the previous year.
