A 32 year-old Los Angeles woman has claimed that she was impregnated by the king of pop, Michael Jackson in a dream. Kiera Johnson, a married mother of two who is suing the musician's estate for child support, says she was raped by the ghost of Michael Jackson.Her white husband Ken Johnson has said he will stick by his wife's side.Kiera claims she experienced the dream after watching the 2-hour Michael Jackson 30 Year Anniversary Special on DVD, which aired on HBO in 2001. "I suddenly dozed off during the performance of Thriller. It was at that point, things went horribly wrong," she said."All of a sudden, I was awakened by a hand caressing my face. But I was home alone, my husband was at work," Kiera recalls. "The next thing you know, I am having this erotic encounter with Michael Jackson. But it wasn t the white Michael Jackson, he was black, and dressed like he was straight out of the Thriller video. I told him to stop, but he would listen, she said. [sic]Kiera thought nothing more about the realistic encounter she had with MJ until May 25, 2016 when she gave birth to her third child. "Everything was going well with the birth but then when I saw my son, and he was black, I said What the hell is this! I was in absolute shock," said her husband Ken."That s when Kiera told me about her terrifying dream. I think it is wrong what happened and that s why we are suing Michael Jackson s estate. We just want a decent amount of child support to help raise his son," he said.[sic]Kiera insists she has never cheated on her husband with anybody of any race. Ken says he believes his wife and has no reason to not trust her, she is his queen. The Johnsons are willing to accept an out-of-court negotiation and are giving the Jackson family until September 1, 2016 to respond. As of yet, the Jackson family has not responded publicly to the allegations.
