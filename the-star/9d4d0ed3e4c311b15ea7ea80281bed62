The Makonde community, a stateless people who have been seeking legal citizenship for decades, today will walk from Kwale to State House, Nairobi.The walk will be flagged off by Governor Salim Mvurya, Kenya Human Right Commission CEO George Kegoro and Makonde chairman Thomas Nguli. The community will be accompanied by officials from KHCR and other human rights organisations.According to The Kenya Citizenship and Immigration Act, 2011, the stateless people should have been registered within five years of the law s commencement. The deadline lapsed in August.Nguli said they expected to be issued with ID cards after the government last year took down their details. We need to be registered and be citizens like other people. Our forefathers came here before Independence and worked on sisal and sugar plantations. We have nowhere to call home apart from Kenya, he said. Last month KHRC manager Diana Gichengo asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to explain the delay in registering the stateless people. She said a taskforce formed to address the issue did not do anything despite using taxpayer money. In two years, the task force has yet to submit any report and recommendations. It is wrong, Gichengo said. She said it is wrong for the government to continue giving stateless people empty promises every year.
