The MCA sponsoring the motion to impeach Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero says he has been betrayed by Cord and Jubilee ward representatives who abruptly ran away.Samuel Nyang wara (Viwandani) cited the decision by Cord MCAs to boycott the sitting on Tuesday and some Jubilee MCAs efforts to withdraw their signatures from the sacking petition. Some members now supporting the governor have been with me all along and pledged to support the motion, he said. But without a quorum, debate cannot take place.Nyang wara commented after speaker Alex Magelo suspended debate on the motion on Wednesday. This was after the embattled city boss obtained a court order on Monday, barring the assembly from summoning him and debating the motion.Magelo said the assembly will try to quash the order. Nyang wara criticised the judiciary for interfering with the assembly. I assure you even if I remain alone, it must be debated, he said.
