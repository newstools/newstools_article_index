The Technical University of Mombasa will start taking students biometric data in an effort to reduce terror attacks, fraud and integrity risks.The details not limited to fingerprints, facial structure, the iris and a person s voice - will be shared with police in case of suspicion of terror activities.Acting vice chancellor Prof Laila Abubakar said the move will enhance cooperation with law enforcers and further improve security.This comes as reports emerged that one of the three women shot dead after raiding the Mombasa Central police station on September 11 was planning to join TUM. Terrorists are said to be targeting university students to radicalise before sending them on bloodletting missions.In 2015, al Shabaab militants killed 147 people, mostly students, at Garissa University College. The ringleader was allegedly a former University of Nairobi law student. Intelligence reports reveal terror groups have started using bioterrorism - the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria or other harmful agents to cause illness and death. Abubakar said CCTVs will be fitted around TUM. Speaking to freshmen on Friday, she cautioned students against hanging around suspicious groups. Radicalisation is our greatest concern. Currently university students and youth are the target. It is wise to warn them so they don t fall prey, Abubakar said.
