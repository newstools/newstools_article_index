Nema has overstepped its mandate on genetically modified maize cultivation, biotechnology experts say.The Kenya University Biotechnology Consortium wants the National Environmental Management Authority to come clean on its application for a permit to cultivate GM maize. Kalro and the African Agricultural Technology Foundation in 2015 applied to biosafety regulators to have the locally developed variety proceed to National Performance Trial by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service.A conditional approval was in February this year granted by the National Biosafety Authority, subject to the applicants sending an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment to Nema for approval. In August, the authority s website showed the application has been approved, though no permit has been issued. This has not gone down well with applicants, who have complained of undue delay. But Nema says the approval was erroneous and will be corrected; and only granted once it collects and analyses public comments. The consortium secretary general Dr Joel Ochieng, yesterday said Nema has not understood the object of the application, perhaps shaping the direction matters have taken, which now scuttles research . Nema believes the applicant is asking them to approve open cultivation of GMO maize, which explains why the authority is seeking direction, he said.
