How many times have women complained amongst themselves that their men are anti-weaves or that they jokingly belong to MAWE (Men Against Weaves and Extensions). Hahaha!The mean often ask why can t you stay with your natural hair? or hiyo nywele ya farasi sipendi kabisa!!! (I don't like that 'horse' hair on your head.However, like any other African woman, it s not easy to maintain natural hair. It requires special grace, energy and patience to maintain natural hair!!!Due to the nature of our kinky hair, it s impossible to achieve a smooth look, comb your hair through in the morning, or run your fingers through the hair.It is perfectly ok and there is nothing wrong with you. This realization makes it near impossible for some ladies not to put weaves.To the men in general, you need to understand that some women cannot do without weaves. Deal with it!For the ladies, if you manage your weave well, have it put in professionally and choose a weave that suites your facial features, I bet the men won't event tell the difference.One of the common complaints however is smelly weaves. Correction. Weaves don t smell, dirty weaves do.If your weave overstays on your head, it will smell. If you stayed for a week or two without taking a shower, you would smell too.If you must wear a weave, please note the following:And if all else fails, natural hair is excellent if you are confident enough to dare it. Look at our First Lady, an outstanding example.Her signature 'silver/grey' cropped look has inspired a new trend and encouraged many women to follow her footsteps.
