The biggest poachers in East Africa are government officials in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, a Ugandan top official has said.Busia mayor Hassan Opiyo on Thursday said it is deplorable that government officials, who are supposed to conserve wildlife, are involved in poaching. He did not elaborate.Opiyo spoke at an event to receive Save the Elephant conservationist Jim Nyamu on Thursday. This revelation is disturbing and calls for the involvement of three governments to end poaching, he said.Opiyo said most of the illegal ivory exported to China comes from East Africa. The ivory is well-hidden during transport. It is not moved using bicycles, Opiyo said.Elephants have a right to live and are a tourist attraction, the mayor said.Opiyo said poachers are targeting baboons in Busitema Forest. They will soon also become endangered, he added. Uganda needs to emulate Kenya and introduce wildlife clubs in schools to create awareness on conservation, Opiyo said.He said devolution in Kenya has diversified revenue sources, making it easier to preserve wildlife. We rely on wildlife and poaching as a source of livelihood, which will only increase poverty, Opiyo said.Busia resident district commissioner Kennedi Otiti praised residents living at the border, saying upholding peace is key to growth and development.In July, an international report said killing African elephants for their ivory seemed to have fallen from record peaks but poaching of the animal is still far too high.More patrols in wildlife parks, better forensic techniques for tracking the origin of tusks and a crackdown on corruption by China, the main market for ivory, were among factors helping to limit the slaughter.
