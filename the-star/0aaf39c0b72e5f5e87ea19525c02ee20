Court of Appeal judge Wanjiru Karanja yesterday said delay in issuing judgment breeds corruption.She said litigants tend to compromise magistrates and judges, when they hold onto rulings and judgments for long.Responding to questions from the Judicial Service Commission interview panel, Karanja, an applicant for the Deputy Chief Justice post said judgments should be delivered as soon as the case is concluded.The judiciary says judgments are supposed to be delivered after one month.Karanja said as the DCJ, she will ensure that corruption is eliminated from the judiciary. I would like to oversee a body in which any Kenyan can walk into the courts and get justice without influencing a magistrate or a judge, she said.The judge said to ensure that corruption is not tolerated, there should be water-tight systems for court processes, starting from filing of the case to its conclusion.Wanjiru, who was a member of the Justice Aaron Ringera committee, which sent a number of magistrates and judges home in 2003, said the purge was unfair. Magistrates and judges who lost their jobs should have been given a fair hearing by the team, she said.At that time she was a magistrate.A number of magistrates and judges were implicated by the committee, which recommended that the corrupt be prosecuted.The officers were given two weeks to resign or face a tribunal, but many left the judiciary for private practice.Wanjiru said the Office of Ombudsman should be devolved to address complaints against the judiciary in the counties.She said having the office in Nairobi alone is not fair as various Court of Appeal, High Court and magistrate s courts are spread across the country. The office, which receives complaints from litigants, should be set up in far-flung areas as people who are in the counties don t have an easy channel of making their complaints, Wanjiru said. The appellant judge said she will use her 30-year experience in the judiciary to improve services.She said she has risen from the position of a magistrate, to the High Court to the Court of Appeal and her experience will help Chief Justice nominee David Maraga to deliver justice to Kenyans.
