The Kenya Film Classification Board CEO has denied trashing the Films and Stage Plays Act Cap 222.Ezekiel Mutua said the unreasonable behaviour by Nairobi stakeholders who were intoxicated during a consultative meeting does not hold water.The group called for a rejection of the document when a consultative meeting was held last week.Mutua (pictured) said their unruly conduct portrayed the worst image of the industry.The CEO said when the contentious issues highlighted in the draft review were presented to Nairobi stakeholders, activists financed by foreign NGOs hijacked the meeting.Mutua said the meeting became unmanageable as they were held hostage in a public place. The only choice that we had was probably to call the police, he said.Mutua said strong views were held but were unreasonable in approach on the negotiated document.Mutua said the Nairobi group did not represent the view of stakeholders countrywide and the document cannot be trashed yet.He said the Board will incorporate the 2013 recommendation of the Presidential Taskforce on Parastatal Reforms, which made KFCB a content regulator.The Department of Film Services was the content regulator but was stripped of the responsibility by the taskforce.Mutua said they are reviewing the Act to accommodate emerging industry demands and regulatory challenges which include exposure of harmful content to children online. The Act was enacted in 1963. It is necessary to revise it in line with the constitution, he said.
