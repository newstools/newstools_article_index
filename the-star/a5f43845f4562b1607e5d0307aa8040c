The Kenya Medical Training College has been ordered to admit all students who passed interviews, pending the determination of a case over the selection stalemate.Justice Anthony Ndung u of the High Court in Nakuru yesterday said both students selected by the Joint Admissions Board and Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service should be admitted.He certified the case as urgent and told the two panels to find a permanent solution to the selection stalemate.Ndung u said the court will decide who will be responsible for admissions if KMTC, JAB and KUCCPS do not resolve the stalemate by October 28.The Attorney General, through State Counsel Wachira Anguyo, said the state will amend the law to rectify the conflict between the Act of 1991 which established KMTC, and the Act of 2012 that established KUCCPS.KUCCPS and KMTC have been sued alongside the AG by citizen Kyalo Kamina, who seeks to know which body is mandated to select students to join KMTC.Kamina said on January 21, KMTC put up an advertisement informing the public it would only admit students it selects, but KUCCPS indicates on its website it admits students.The petitioner said the KMTC warning made KCSE leavers not apply through any other channel.KMTC had said students who have not been notified of admission will be turned away during the 2016-17 enrolment.The officer of the Attorney General will file submissions on October 28 when the case is mentioned.
