A bullet was recovered from one of the female terror suspects gunned down in Mombasa's Central police station, in an autopsy led by government pathologist Johansen Oduor at Coast General hospital.According to Oduor, the exercise was minimal as was agreed with the family."We recovered one bullet and handed it over for investigations. One totally burnt and the other had at least four bullet-wounds. There were head, arm and chest injuries," said Oduor The bodies of the twin slain suspects Maimuna and Ramla Abdulrahman Hussein were released from Coast General Hospital on Saturday Evening and laid to rest at Manyimbo cemetery.Prayers were first conducted at Masjid- Ul- Khaiyarat - Kiziwi before the burial.A source close to the family said they were relieved that they finally buried the bodies."This was psychological torture. But at last the bodies have been laid to rest," he said Postmortem is yet to be conducted on the third suspect, identified as Tasnin Yakhub, since no one has come to claim the body.
