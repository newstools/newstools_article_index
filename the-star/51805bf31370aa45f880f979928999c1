Cord leader Raila Odinga has urged Taita Taveta residents to vote for the six piece suit next year. The six-piece suit voting pattern is where one votes for the president, governor, senator, woman representative, MP and MCA from the same political party. While addressing rallies in Taveta, Wundanyi, Mwatate and Voi, Raila told the residents that they should vote in Cord hopefuls. The majority of leaders in the county were elected on the ODM ticket. But Senator Dan Mwazo has opposed the proposal, saying some leaders elected on party basis have failed the county. He has been traversing the county seeking forgiveness for "misleading residents into voting the six-piece suit pattern".Mwazo was conspicuously absent during Raila's rallies. He has said he is still in ODM but will not join anyone s team when campaigning.
