Families affected by landslides in Gakira village, Kigumo subcounty, in April have accused the national and county leaders of neglecting them. They said area leaders promised to provide food, bedding and help them move after the tragedy, which killed an elderly woman. The leaders moved us to Mariira Agricultural Centre, where they gave us food for a few days and promised to send more. They also promised to help us find alternative land to settle, but five months later none of them has come to check how we are doing or update us, Esther Mirara said.She said the leaders are now blaming one another. But area MP Jamleck Kamau, who was among the first leaders to arrive at the scene after the tragedy, said he will help the families get compensation from the Sh1.7 billion Disaster Management Fund.
