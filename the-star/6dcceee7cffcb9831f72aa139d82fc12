The Council of Legal Education has been sued for changing the structure of the final examination offered at Kenya School of Law.Law student Nyambira Oguta filed the case on Wednesday saying the council increased the number of questions without necessarily increasing the amount of time for each.Oguta believes this was in total breach of the legitimate expectation, and that increasing the number of questions from four to five was unlawful.He said the current academic class at the school has always attempted four questions.Oguta wants the High Court to quash the decision of the board conveyed in August 2016.The examination guide distributed to the students earlier this year did not mention that students were going to be required to tackle 5 questions on all the 9 subjects taught at the institution.
