Three police officers linked to the death of lawyer Willie Kimani and two others have been detained for 14 days pending investigations.Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Chebulet and Silvia Wanjiku were presented at Milimani Law courts on Monday.The Director of Public Prosecutions told the court that investigations into the murder were complex and that they require more time do a thorough probe.Chief Magistrate Daniel Ogembo was also asked to consider the anger and public outcry that the killing of the three men has aroused.DPP told the court that police are following crucial leads that they believe will assist in arresting other suspects who are still at large.Lawyer Cliff Ombeta who is representing the three officers did not oppose their detention, but he accused Ipoa of interfering with the investigations.Making the ruling, Ogembo said the three will be detained but he did not state where they will be held.Ogembo said they will be brought back to court on July 18 adding " the police are free to charge them if they complete investigations". Kimani, 32, and his client Josephat Mwenda, a boda boda operator, had filed a complaint alleging that Mwenda had been shot and injured by police in April.Mwenda was then charged with a range of offences, including possessing drugs, gambling in public and resisting arrest, according to human rights activists.The two and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri went missing after a court session at Mavoko law courts on June 23.At about 5.30 pm last Thursday, their bodies were later found floating in Oldonyo Sabuk River.Shortly after the bodies were retrieved, members of LSK marched to the Inspector General's office to demand an investigation.New York-based Human Rights Watch said on Thursday that there was "credible evidence the men were, at some point, in the custody of Administration Police, and may be victims of an enforced disappearance".Read: Lawyer Willie Kimani's murderers will not be tolerated - AGRights groups have in the past accused some sections of police of involvement in extrajudicial killings; a charge police deny.
