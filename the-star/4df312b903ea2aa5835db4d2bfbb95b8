Water PS Fred Segor said four projects are at various stages of implementation. He said evaluation, design reviews, pre-tender documents and supervision of the Sh1.5 billion Mulot-Bomet water and sanitation project are complete. Other projects in the two counties include the Sh300 million Lolgorian water and sanitation project and the Sh600 million Kilgoris water project.Segor said the African Development Bank is funding the Narok sewerage project for Sh1.6 billion. He told the Star the ministry aims to improve community livelihoods, especially for those living in the Mara River Basin. It faces threats such as destruction of upstream watershed, declining water levels, poor water quality and increased pollution due to discharge of effluent into rivers.During the Mara Day Celebrations in Bomet, Governor Isaac Rutto urged the national government to end water shortage. We need the national government s support in addressing water and sanitation problem in Bomet town, he said.
