Jubilee politician Suleiman Shahbal has urged Kenyan women to embrace their natural beauty and reduce the use of make-up.In a Facebook post on Friday, the banker opened up about his life away from politics and business, indicating that listening to RnB was one of his favourite pastimes.Shahbal indicated that American songbird Alicia Keys was one of his favourite artistes and urged Kenyan women to copy her latest look."She has now set a new trend in America as she goes about in her natural hair and no make-up. Natural is beautiful," Shahbal said in his post."Alicia Keys has been one of my favorite singers since her first album 'Songs in A Minor'. Beautiful, talented and sassy. Ebony magazine, for years the trend setting magazine in Black America, applauds her. I like it."The banker, who jetted back into the country from New York on Thursday evening, said artificial hair and make-up are not necessarily the only things that make Kenyan women beautiful.He was one of the Kenyan delegates who accompanied Deputy President William Ruto to the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.Shahbal is in the race for Mombasa governor alongside incumbent Hassan Joho, Senator Hassan Omar, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti and former Kisauni MP Ananiah Mwaboza.
