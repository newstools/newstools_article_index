Parents of pupils at Kiembeni Baptist Primary School, Mombasa, have accused the head teacher of charging exam fees. President Uhuru Kenyatta in August waived national exam fees for all private schools.The parents want Onesmus Mwatsuma transferred and disciplinary action taken against him. Mwatsuma allegedly charges Sh200 per candidate for registration for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exam.The school has 240 candidates. Mwatsuma could not be reached for comment as our calls went unanswered. Our children have been turned into cash cows, a parent said.
