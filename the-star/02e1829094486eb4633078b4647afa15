Chiki Kuruka is one lady who has managed to climb the celebrity ladder at a fast pace. She is one of the best choreographers we have in town and she's not even trying hard. Many are trying to keep up with her but fail miserably. But she's not about the bragging life like most people are known to be.Her life as a choreographer is all for the good of the people.Chiki first came to the limelight or rather was recognized when she made a debut on Citizen TV's weight loss show 'Slim Possible' that is all about helping both men and women loose weight.She was the choreographer of the program and helped the contestants to have fun as they partake the challenge of loosing some kilos.Apart from being a choreographer, Chiki also needs some tender love and care in her life. Well, she's getting all that, that's for sure as she is dating one of Sauti Sol's band members, Bien Baraza.They have been dating for a while now and are not shy to show you how deep their love is.She has always been a support system to her boyfriend as she has been spotted in most of their concerts across the country and beyond.But today, Chiki is not smiling. She has lost someone special and dear to her; her grandmother. She took o social media to share her grief writing, "When God sends us an angel we must realise that she is on loan, and that she will be probably needed back some day........ We have held on to you as our angel in life for so long, I guess it's now your time to be a guardian angel to many. I will always love you. RIP grandma X." Condolences go out to Chiki and her family.
