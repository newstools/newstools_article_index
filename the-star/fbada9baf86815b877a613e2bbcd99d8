The impact of the no-party-hopping Act is already being felt as politicians lobby for party tickets ahead of next year s elections. Federal Party of Kenya chairman Phillip Obonyo and Joel Otuoma (leader) said they have received many politicians requests to run on its ticket.Obonyo said five governors, 35 MPs, two senators, one woman representative and more than 70 MCAs have approached the FPK secretariat for tickets. Most of these politicians fear they will be floored during nominations in their current parties, despite being promised free and fair party primaries, he said.Speaking to the Star on Monday in Homa Bay town, Obonyo said they have received proposals from 50 MP, 10 governor, 15 senator and six woman representative hopefuls. We have been approached by several sitting governors, MPs, senators and members of county assemblies for tickets to vie in the next elections, he said.Obonyo, who is also the Political Parties Registrar liaison committee chairman, said the politicians are from Nyanza, Coast, Northeastern and Eastern and Western regions. Two governors hail from Nyanza and one each from the Coast, Northeastern and Eastern. But MPs and MCAs are from across the country, he said.
