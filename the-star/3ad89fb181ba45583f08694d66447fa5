After missing 10km world record by three seconds ten days ago, Violah Jepchumba easily cruised to victory at the Eldoret Agri-business 10km run yesterday.With a 30:24 world second fastest time in history as well as African record in 10km she set at the Birell Prague Grand Prix, Jepchumba easily romped to victory in 33:35 during the Eldoret race. Damaris Mutua was second in 34:50 while Gladys Tarus sealed the podium in 35:01. Cross Country sensational Sheilah Chepng etich finished fourth in 35:03 while former All-Africa Games 3,000m steeplechase champion Ruth Bosibori settled for fifth in 36:27.Rebecca Jesang (37:41), Agnes Jelagat (38:07), Monicah Jebet (38:31), Jane Jerop (38:36) and Alicent Jepleting (40:58) completed the top 10 places.Jepchumba, who clocked 65:51 to win Prague Half marathon last month, looked composed in the entire race as he stuck with the leading pack before taking charge at the 3km mark. Unshaken by the tough competition from Bosibori, Mutua and Chepng etich, Jepchumba whirled her way into front and maintained the pace to the finish.With Cardiff half marathon next week for her, the 25-year old from Kurgung in Nandi County, said the Eldoret race was a good build up for her. I was coming for morning intervals because I am training for Cardiff half marathon and I realised there was a race. I decided to register and use it to prepare for the race since I am trying to improve my speed, she said.In the men s category, the Standard Chartered Marathon winner Joshua Kipkorir blazed the trails at the Teresia-Chepkoilel road winning in 29:34. I thought the field would be a walk over but the guys became very competitive. For me to be safe, I broke away and led until the tape, Kipkorir said. He has a personal best time of 2.13.25, which he posted at the Stan-chart Marathon. Titus Chepkirui finished second in 29:45 while Peter Kipkemei came third in 29:50.
