Taxi services firm Pewin Cabs has launched a hailing application Dandia as it bids for a share of the growing segment where stiff competition has led to a price war among operators.Dandia is an upgrade of the existing Pewin app which offers customers fixed prices, as opposed to the common taxi-hailing services where fares are calculated on the distance, base fare and time taken on the journey.Pewin CEO Justus Kirigua on Friday said the company settled on a zoning pricing formula to save clients from the high costs incurred in other fare formulas which include time taken, especially in the city s heavy traffic.A ride from the Nairobi Central Business District to Westlands is fixed at Sh250. The app allows customers to choose the type of vehicle to use depending on the number.
