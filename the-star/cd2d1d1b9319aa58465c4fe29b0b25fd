The Judiciary auctioned 40 cars despite allegations of a plot to hike prices to lock out buyers in favour of selected bidders.A section of disgruntled bidders claimed there were prior plans to exaggerate the prices to discourage them in favour of certain individuals.Ochieng Owino, a mechanic on Kangundo road, said he had identified a Land Rover which was selling at Sh112, 000 but the price went up to Sh600,000."I wanted to buy and repair then sell it but who will I sell it to if I buy at Sh600, 000 then incur duty charges and repair costs?" asked Owino.Kevin Mambo, who bought a Mercedes Benz car at Sh1.2m, had expected to buy one of those auctioned at Sh400,000 because it was advertised for a price below Sh300, 000."The allegations of deliberate hiking of prices to lock out some people are there and we are not taking them seriously," he said.They also lamented that bidders were allowed to register two days after the registration was closed on Wednesday.But the auctioneer Isaac Ringera dismissed the claims and said the cars were sold to the highest bidders."We expect them to have paid a 25 per cent of the prices before close of the day. If they don't, they will lose the Sh10, 000 they had paid for deposit," Ringera said. Ringera said half of those who had registered did not turn up for the auction. Some of the bidders started paying deposits immediately.The judiciary is disposing the cars especially those with higher engine capacity to cut down on expenditure on fuel. The vehicles were used by judges and other judiciary officials.Read: Judiciary to auction 40 Mercedes Benz vehicles at Sh25,000 to Sh455,000
