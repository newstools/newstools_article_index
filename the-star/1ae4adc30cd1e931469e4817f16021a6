ODM has accused the government of harassing and frustrating its members through its agencies.In a statement on Tuesday, the party expressed displeasure at the Jubilee administration for 'blackmailing' ODM members.The party was referring to a case in which Nabii Nabwera, Kakamega chief of staff, was accused being involved in chaos that marred a Ford Kenya rally in April.This was when Moses Wetang'ula launched his presidential bid; an event that saw teargas hurled at the VIP dais.

Nabwera too did not attend.We see this as bias and incompetence on the side of the law enforcement agencies," he said.In April, Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula launched his presidential bid at a ceremony skipped by Raila.The chaotic ceremony at Muliro gardens was disrupted for nearly half an hour as police lobbed teargas at the main dais forcing the leaders to be whisked away.Two people were seriously injured and rushed to hospital after a stampede as people scampered for safety.Ford Kenya supporters had earlier tore and burnt ODM t-shirts and caps in protest that the ceremony was their party affair.
