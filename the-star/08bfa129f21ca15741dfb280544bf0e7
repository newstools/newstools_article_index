The International Monetary Fund has said the global economy has managed to avoid a catastrophic financial crisis that was expected after the UK voted to leave the European Union on June 24.The EU referendum, widely publicised as the Brexit, had been seen as a key driver of short-term risks in the past months, having caught investors by surprise and initially roiled global markets.In the aftermath of the Brexit, the IMF says, the global markets managed to operate without significant disruption, and no major disorderly events surfaced, other than a sharp sell-off in some UK-based real estate funds. The global financial system has been strengthened since the crisis, and the political shock was absorbed by markets, the IMF said on Thursday in the latest series of the Global Financial Stability Report.The assurance comes as relief for most countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa, which were among the markets expected to take a hit from the Brexit owing to entrenched trade links with Britain.Kenya was particularly seen as a big casualty due to her extensive economic relations with the UK, which largely covers horticultural exports. New firewalls in the euro area, including the European Central Bank s asset purchase programmes and other backstops, supported smooth market adjustment and prevented contagion, the IMF said. In contrast with past episodes of global turbulence, flows into emerging markets were resilient and have increased since the referendum. Despite lower short-term risks, the IMF warns that medium-term risks are rising due to a wide range of preexisting vulnerabilities and new challenges . In emerging market economies, the challenge is to achieve a smooth deleveraging of weakened corporate balance sheets in a new environment of lower commodity prices, slower credit growth, and weaker external demand, the IMF said.
