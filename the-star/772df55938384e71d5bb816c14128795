Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has linked the protests against the appointment of Prof Laban Ayiro as the acting Moi University vice chancellor to the Sh17 billion laptops project. The university is part of a consortium which won a tender to supply laptops to Standard One pupils in 26 counties. Keter on Thursday said cartels want Isaac Kosgey appointed as VC to interfere with the project.Keter said the project will fail if President Uhuru Kenyatta does not intervene.He addressed a roadside rally in Eldoret town. Keter said cartels want to divert part of the Sh7.5 billion the university has set aside for the project. The saga at Moi University is not about tribalism as we are told, he said.
