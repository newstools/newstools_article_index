Jubilee politicians from Kajiado Central have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to allow them go alone and dislodge ODM from the seat.Antony Kiroken, who lost the JAP ticket to Patrick Tutui in the March 2015 by-election, said he is best placed to single handedly beat ODM's Memusi Kanchori in the 2017 polls.Memusi defected to ODM from JAP after which the opposition party gave him a direct ticket to face off with Tutui in the by-election and won.Kiroken's ambitions were boosted by the defection of some 500 supporters of the Kajiado Central MP who decamped to Jubilee Party on Monday at Dalalekutuk Ward.Tutui is yet to declare whether he will seek the people's mandate having lost to Memusi in the mini polls staged by the appointment of Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery.When he received the defectors, Kiroken said: "Let Memusi bring his Cord principals to campaign for him. I have enough foot soldiers and do not want people to think I am a government project," He told his supporters at a political rally in Esilale that it is the will of his voters that he faces the opposition without the support of the ruling party.Kiroken said that he has the energy and resolve to capture the seat from Memusi.Kenya Meat Commission chairman Tarayia ole Kores, who is seeking to unseat governor David Nkedianye on a Jubilee ticket, said he is more ready than before for the job."I failed to be on the ballot paper in 2013 because of a technical hitch and that is now history," he said at the same event."I have three other candidates who will face off with me in the party nomination ahead of the 2017 general election. Count on me, I will beat them all," Kores said.The candidate, who was cheered all through his speech, said he has never seen a payslip all his life.Kores said he is out to make history by unseating Nkedianye so that he can also be in government payroll.Former Interior CS Joseph ole Lenku also attended the rally and told the people of Kajiado to elect him for the governor position.Lenku had his speech cut short after part of those who attended the meeting started murmuring, some walking despite appeals by Dalalekutuk MCA, Nkitinyo ole Lesere.Read: Nkedianye supporters boo Nkaissery after blocking roads to frustrate CS
