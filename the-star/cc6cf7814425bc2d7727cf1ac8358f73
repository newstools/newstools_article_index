Graduates from University of Nairobi (25.6 per cent), Kenyatta (19 per cent) and Moi (10.3 per cent) are more likely to be employed in Kenya, a report has revealed.The survey also showed 8.6 per cent graduates likely to be absorbed into the job market were from KCA and Strathmore universities, and less than five per cent from Maseno, Catholic, JKUAT, Egerton and Masinde Muliro.The survey dubbed 'Universities, employability, and inclusive development' was carried out by the British Council."This report revealed that the three universities from where graduates are more likely to be employed provide more graduates for the job market," said Tristan McCowan from the Institute of Education, University College London.McCowan said the institutions' historical prestige may also be a contributing factor.The report also showed that more than half of university graduates believe they cannot be employed despite having a degree.Less than 20 per cent of those interviewed attributed this to the poor economic climate, ill regard for their universities by employers, the shrinking job market and degrees that are too general.Thirty four per cent interviewees indicated they were unable to find jobs because they did not have social networks while 34 per cent pointed out lack of family connections. Lack of social networks and family connections were seen by students as the main barriers to employment," McCowan said. "It is about who you know Without these networks they were certain they cannot be employed. It was also reported that 65 per cent students said they wanted to venture into self employment as a result of the dwindling job market.Those interviewed thought self employment was a better alternative to formal employment, which requires a specific set of qualifications. What was lacking among the institutions was (the preparation of) students for this reality when they joined universities," said Ibrahim Oanda from the Council for the development of social science research in Africa."The institutions only prepare them for formal employment such that when they are not doing a white collar job they are unemployed. The study involved 1,300 students from Nairobi, Kenyatta and Daystar universities.
