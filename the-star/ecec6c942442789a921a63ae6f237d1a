The Kenya Bureau of Standards and African Organisation for Standardisation has rolled out the fourth essay contest for university and college students to create awareness on standardisation.The annual competition, open to students in all areas of study below the age of 35, will reward the first three winners with certificates and a cash prize of Sh70,000, Sh60,000 and Sh50,000. Kenya has experienced important social and political reforms in recent decades in human rights. However, much remains to be done. It is thus essential for us to understand the perspective of youth on key challenges relating to human rights policy, said Kebs director for communications in a statement.
