Gethi filed the complaint at the Parklands police station on Monday morning, OB 2/10/10/2016, saying he received the threats at the weekend.He said he was warned that he was the target for elimination, because of the confidential information he has.Gethi said in his statement that a man on a motorcycle handed a note with the threats to his driver.
