Prosperity and transformation will remain a promise with no hope of attainment for present and future generations," he said. "That is why I urge member states to consider enhancing the implementation of the Comesa protocol on gradual relaxation and eventual elimination of visas as a starting point."

"To unlock our strength it is necessary to confront structural and institutional bottlenecks to greater intra-Africa trade and commerce," he added.He observed that according to the World Bank ease of doing business outlook. It takes an average of 110 days to start a business, 183 to acquire construction permits and 113 to get electricity in the Comesa region."The global standard in all cases in one day, that is how badly we are doing as a bloc and as individual national economies." "We are nearly four months behind the global average meaning we are absolutely uncompetitive and unattractive as a business and investment destination," he said.
