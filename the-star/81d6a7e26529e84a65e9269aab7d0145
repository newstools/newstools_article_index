The Kitui county government will soon commission an oxygen manufacturing plant to be used in Kitui General Hospital and other county health facilities.The Blood Transfusion Centre is a joint deal with the National Blood Transfusion Centre. It will allow the general hospital to conduct blood transfusions.Currently, patients are refered to Machakos General Hospital.The plant will cost Sh15 million and will help save the lives of accident victims and mitigate other emergency health procedures.The new health complex will also have adequate supply of oxygen manufactured at a nearby site to reduce the cost of health procedures.The facility will serve Kitui Level 5 Hospital. It will improve the quality of medical care and save residents millions of shillings spent on oxygen.Health executive Fred Muli said the equipment has been brought in and the works are set to completed on time.Muli said the county government has embarked on a major refurbishment of health facilities.In the project, a Sh60 million Outpatient centre to include a casualty and emergency unit will be constructed.Muli said the Ikutha Level 4 Hospital will be opened to the public next month after a radiology machine has been installed.

The hospital will have paediatric, maternity, outpatient and inpatient units, Muli said.He said Malombe s strategy in health provision is to open up far-flung rural areas that had little or no facilities to provide equity as enshrined in the Constitution.At the same time, Muli says a Major uplift of Kitui General Hospital was on going.Among the facilities being put in place is a satellite blood transfusion centre, amenity theatre ward,paediatric block and other facilities that will help improve on health procedures.He however said the General hospital facilities were stretched due to a major rise in populationoccasioned by the positive effects of devolution.
