Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been in the news recently because of his role in the disastrous Iraq war.If additional accusations were to be made against Tony Blair, one would be that he went back on a promise he made to Gordon Brown at a time when they were the two top contenders for leadership of the Labour Party that if he became PM, he would serve for only a single term. Then Brown would have his turn.Of course, it is impossible to know the precise political pact between these two men. To the best of my knowledge, they have never discussed it in publicly. But such is the allegation made by knowledgeable UK journalists and politicians.Brown did get to serve a single term as PM. But only after Blair had served for 10 years.Much the same pattern has been seen in Kenya. In the run-up to the 2002 election, candidate Mwai Kibaki reportedly promised key supporter Raila Odinga appointment as Prime Minister in the Kibaki administration a position not yet created.Expert opinion: Mudavadi: How Uhuru, Ruto duped me in 2012In the calmest manner possible, Kibaki then went on to overlook this crucial promise, and Raila had to consent to serving as a Cabinet minister, no different from any other.It took the deeply controversial 2007 general election, and the subsequent post-election violence, to compel the creation of a coalition government in which Raila became Prime Minister. there are many other examples, in Kenya and other countries, of politicians making the most explicit promises of either power sharing, or of "giving way" to a political rival after a single term in gratitude for that rival's support. Or all sorts of other elaborate promises, some actually put down on paper and signed which later turned out not to be worth the paper they were written on.In this context, the bitterness still felt by former Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi for have been denied the support promised by Uhuru Kenyatta back in 2013 is really not justified.Very likely there are less prominent politicians who would be equally bitter in claiming Mudavadi promised them this or that, but did not deliver. Most certainly, Raila was not the only prominent personality in 2002, who believed promises made to him by Mwai Kibaki had been broken once Kibaki became President.The process of ascending to the highest office in any country seems to intrinsically involve making promises that with the best goodwill in the world simply cannot be kept.
