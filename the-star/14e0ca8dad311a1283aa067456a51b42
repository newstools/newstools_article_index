After the Eldoret Summit I was contacted by 1608 Creatives - an online global fashion incubation hub based in the United States and we signed a partnership agreement worth Ksh 16.5 million. Fadhili explained with this money he will be able to achieve his company s dream of giving funds, mentorship, office space, PR, marketing capacity and media coverage to more startup businesses, thus empower more young Kenyans to own their destinies.During the day-long summit, there will be different pod sessions offering mentorship on various areas ranging from business, social enterprise, agriculture, entertainment, sports and arts.Other mentors who will participate in the Nairobi Summit include Michael Olulo, CEO and Creative Director at 56 Authentique, photographer Migwa Nthigah and Michelle Ntalami, founder of Marini Naturals and CEO of Brandvine Group. When we did our research on how we should communicate to the youth we discovered careers that we did not know existed. Today s young people are unlike anything we have ever seen before; they are daring, unconventional and unapologetic and we have to speak their language, said Sylvia Mulinge, Director Consumer Business, Safaricom.Mulinge further explained that through the summits youth will get a chance to network and audition for the upcoming B.Y.O.B TV show which will see 12 contestants compete for a chance to win funding for their businesses.Other summits to take place after the Nairobi one will be in Mombasa and Kisumu consecutively. Entry into each summit costs Ksh 100 per person, redeemable for airtime or merchandise at the venue.Blaze which cost Ksh 700 million to conceptualise, develop and launch is the first platform of its kind in the East and Central African market to be co-created with the youth, for the youth.
