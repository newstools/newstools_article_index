You may soon redeem your Safaricom Bonga points for a cab ride in the newly launched taxi-hailing app company Little Cabs.The service, launched to rival fast-growing international smart cab company Uber, will be operated by giant telecommunications firm Safaricom.The Little Cabs app was developed by the telco in partnership with financial solutions software provider Craft Silicon."This is a completely local product which is well in position for competition," Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore said on Tuesday.Clients will be able to pay for cab fare using Mpesa or Visa and MasterCard branded bank cards. Safaricom said it is developing the app further to enable clients to pay the fare using their subscriber loyalty reward, Bonga Points.Little Cabs has stepped up competition, promising to give drivers a bigger share of the revenue than similar taxi services. Uber launched in Kenya early last year, with a debut in Nairobi. It has since expanded services to Mombasa and Thika. The US-based company rattled traditional taxis with cheaper fares and convenient services, leading to several attacks on Uber drivers including the torching of two vehicles in Nairobi.More on this: Safaricom takes on Uber with rival firm to grow revenues
