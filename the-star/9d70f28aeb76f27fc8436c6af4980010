Judging by the latest newspaper reports, we are already at that point in the Kenyan election cycle when elected leaders are routinely getting booed by villagers whom they had mostly ignored for the past four years.This is also the time when opponents arise to declare the incumbent has done nothing and in general, failed to initiate development .It s this question of initiating development that I want to address here: Do Kenyans really care much about development when they cast their votes? Or are they more concerned about other things altogether?In answering this, I would point out that any debate on this subject can only refer to regional seats, from governor and senator downwards.For when it comes to the presidency, the pattern is already very clear votes cast for the presidential candidates have nothing to do with whether or not any particular candidate can reasonably be expected to bring development .Rather, it has everything to do with two abiding factors. The first is an odd demand for fairness : The argument that each community, however small, should be able to feel that at some point in the future, they too will have one of their own ascend to the presidency. This is not just a yearning for inclusiveness. It is, rather, that each community needs to believe that, in the fullness of time, our turn will come. The second factor, closely tied to this first one, is what is sometimes called the politics of resentment . By this we mean it is usually quite easy to mobilse the rest of the country against either the Kikuyu community or the Kalenjin community in presidential politics, solely on the grounds that they have already had their turn .The Kikuyu community in particular is very vulnerable to this accusation, having produced three of Kenyan s four Presidents to date. I once read an article about some world-famous development economist who was absolutely stunned that President Mwai Kibaki won his reelection, in 2007, by the slimmest of margins, and under circumstances that raised doubt as to whether he had really won at all.For this economist had taken it as an indisputable fact that Africans granted free and fair elections would vote for a leader who had demonstrated a capacity to steer their nation towards prosperity: As Kibaki had manifestly done.And yet the voting patterns in that election had shown beyond doubt that voters in general cared nothing for Kenya s remarkable economic growth rates, as achieved under Kibaki.They voted on the basis of the two main tribal coalitions that had been created prior to that election. Kibaki s coalition happened to be the smaller one (which is why so many were convinced that he had actually lost) despite his superlative efforts to deliver on the promise of development .Taking a lesson from this, President Uhuru Kenyatta has spared no effort to create a vast, inclusive political party, which whatever you may say about it is certainly a very large political outfit. It is unlikely that, should Uhuru win in 2017, there would be valid doubts about how exactly he managed to win.However, we know from the experience of retired President Daniel Moi that in Kenya, creating a potent political coalition is actually the easier part of it. Keeping it together is a totally different ball game and the harder part of the effort required on the road to victory in a presidential election.So if President Uhuru should lose improbable as that may seem at this point it will likewise be clear just why it is that he ended up going down in defeat.It will be because he failed to keep together the mighty political monolith that he had created.Next week I will look into whether development records really count for anything in the county and constituency-level elections.
