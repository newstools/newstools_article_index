Education CS Fred Matiang'i has interdicted the Siaya county education director and six other officials over the display of the Governor's photo on mock exam papers.Matiang'i said in a statement on Wednesday that the officials "bore the greatest responsibility for the gross violation of set guidelines".He said the class eight examination papers had been cancelled and schools advised to prepare internally for national examinations"In line with Basic Education Act 2012, the ministry has taken the decision to dissolve and reconstitute the Siaya County Education Board," he added.He asked relevant agencies to nominate new members with immediate effect.The Siaya government was sharpy criticised for spending Sh1.7 million to print this year s class eight mock exam papers, bearing Governor Cornel Rasanga's photo on the right side.But Pamela Okello, county executive in charge of education, said their intention was to keep parents from paying for the test."We have received complaints from parents that they are being subjected to pay. The CDF and other donors have facilitated the same and that is why we branded the paper with Rasanga's photo," said Okello.The display of the governor s portrait was justified as it will help parents and donors not to pay double for the same examination, she said.She spoke at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology grounds on Tuesday.The executive further said they realised a section of teachers was approaching organisations, teachers and the county for exam sponsorship.The photo makes it clear that the examination was fully funded by the county government, she added.She also said the move was in support of the national government as "primary and secondary education is not devolved".Okello also said the intention was to help students get used to their governor, and that similar mock examination papers will be distributed in subsequent years.She said the picture meant "Rasanga tena which is Kiswahili for "Rasanga again".The executive further explained that the process will help boost the performance of pupils in the next national examination.She added that the papers will benefit close to 8,000 candidates who will be seating for this year s KCPE exams.Okello maintained that the county government would not politicise maters of education. But her explanation was not enough to deter uproar by residents who also took to social media to accuse Rasanga of using county coffers to campaign.Vincent Ochieng advised that the Governor should have considered placing the county logo on the mock papers. instead of his picture."Even if the Mock is sponsored by the county government, it was not necessary for Rasanga's photo to appear as he did not personally fund the exam," said Ochieng.A teacher who sought anonymity for fear of victimisation said if such continues, a time will come when the president s portrait will be put on KCSE and KCPE papers.Matiangi maintained that inter-school mock exams stand banned after task forces that investigated cases of school unrest found students were under heavy pressure and streess."Education is not a devolved function and should thus be run by the national government in consultation with sector players," he said."Administering inter-school tests close to the start of national examinations amounts to frustrating efforts of the Knec to prepare adequately for the important countrywide exercise."
