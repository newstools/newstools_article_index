Communal group ranches in Samburu have received title deeds after 44 years of wait.The ministry of lands issued the document to Noontoto in Samburu central; Tinga B group ranch in Loosuk ward and Lowaoiting group ranch in Porro area.The three were the first to receive the prestigious document in what Governor Moses Lenolkulal says will give them better economic livelihoods.He said slow development in Samburu has been because residents don't have title deeds, therefore lack security of their property.The governor also stated that the move will go a long way in solving some of the cross boundary conflicts that have been experienced in the area.Lands CEC Senei Leseeto assured the Samburu residents of her department's support of rolling out the issuance of title deeds to all the registered group ranches across the county."With such policies, the decades-old scourge of marginalisation that has rocked Samburu on land ownership issues will be a thing of the past. Communities will gradually shift to individual land ownership schemes necessary for development of both local and international economies," the CEC said.Read: 60,000 uncollected title deeds lie at the Bondo Lands registry
