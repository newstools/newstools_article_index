Kisauni MP hopeful Ali Mbogo has urged residents to vote for educated leaders who will take care of their welfare. He said the world is increasingly getting educated and electing uneducated individuals will only take the constituency backward. Mbogo urged Mombasa county to establish more tertiary institutions in Kisauni, which only has the Kisauni Youth Polytechnic.
