Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has been accused of sowing discord among leaders and being behind a scheme to divide the Kalenjin community. Energy CS Charles Keter said the governor s new political outfit - Chama Cha Mashinani is a tool to separate the community and undermine Deputy President William Ruto s quest to unite the people. We are trying very hard to bring our people together, but it is sad that some individuals are out to divide us. Let us stop the unnecessary sideshows and support the DP, because 2022 is not far, he said.Keter spoke at St Theresa Catholic Church at Mogogosiek in Konoin during a fundraiser presided over by DP Ruto. Governor Rutto skipped the event and instead chose to attend a similar function at Kaplong in Sotik. He said he was not aware of the DP s visit to the region. Rutto hit out at the DP, claiming his visits to the region are meant to undermine him.
