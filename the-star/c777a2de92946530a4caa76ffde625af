Lamu mothers have expressed concern over increased numbers of school dropouts and drug use among schoolchildren. They said children from Kashmir, Kandahar, Bombay, Langoni, Mkomani and Wiyoni villages loiter around and others use drugs openly. The mothers spoke yesterday in a meeting with Maendeleo ya Wanawake Lamu chairperson Fatma Salim.They said the rate at which children drop out of school could pose a security threat if urgent measures are not taken to have them back in school and get them to stop using drugs. Salim urged the county to hunt down and arrest drug peddlers so they be prosecuted.
