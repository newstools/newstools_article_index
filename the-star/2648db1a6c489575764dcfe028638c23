The National Treasury has appointed international consultants to develop an Islamic finance policy that will be needed before Kenya is allowed to join the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.Since the beginning to the year, Treasury has been working on structures needed to gain OIC membership, which is a required before a country can start accessing cheaper loans from the Islamic Development Bank.OIC is the second largest inter-governmental organisation after the United Nations and has a membership of 57 states, spread over four continents.Treasury Principal secretary Kamau Thugge said the consultants are drawn from the Islamic Finance Advisory &amp; Assurance Services, an international consultancy firm specialized in Islamic finance and they will work in collaboration with Simmons &amp; Simmons - an international law firm.Their task is to provide global benchmarking and technical advisory to the newly set up Islamic Finance Project Management Office which is made up of nominees from the Central Bank of Kenya, Insurance Regulatory Authority, Retirement Benefits Authority, Saccos Societies Regulatory Authority and the Capital Markets Authority.Thugge said the joint consultative committee is expected to put in place a national Shariah Governance Framework to guarantee standards and compliance with Shariah provisions including a cross-cutting financial sector National Shariah Supervisory Board. The implementation of these reforms will leapfrog our plan of attaining membership in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation inorder to start accessing cheaper loans from the Islamic Development Bank, the PS said on Friday during the launch of the Islamic Finance Project Management Office in Nairobi.The Islamic financial sector is based on Islamic principles that discourage interest, speculation and empathize ethical investment.According to the PS, the state will also consider issuing a sovereign Sukuk after the implementation of Islamic finance reforms.According to the Islamic Financial Services Board, Islamic financial sector reached an overall total value of $1.88 trillion (Sh189.88 trillion) in 2015, with expectations of market size growth to $3.4 trillion (Sh343.40 trillion) by end of 2018.The state envisions that the development of a formal Shariah compliant financial sector will create a gateway for regional and international capital flows into the country with a particular focus on infrastructure project funding.CMA acting chief executive Paul Muthaura said the strategy to accelerate Islamic finance uptake is underpinned by the ambition to transform Kenya into an International Finance Centre as part of the implementation of the Capital Markets Master Plan. Globally, you looking at about $2 trillion (Sh202 trillion) in the Islamic financial sector that is available to support the real economy, he said.
