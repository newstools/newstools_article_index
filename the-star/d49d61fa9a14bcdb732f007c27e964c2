Giant killers Nzoia United have a chance to make history once again when they come face to face with premier league giants Ulinzi Stars in the quarter finals of the GOtv Shield tournament at Moi stadium in Kisumu. The high-flying and unbeaten national super league leaders stunned the Kenyan football fraternity by knocking out record winners Gor Mahia in the last 16 and a similar feat this afternoon will enhance their reputation as a team capable of rubbing shoulders with top flight clubs should they, as expected, clinch a promotion berth. Though Nzoia have registered their reservations over the change of venue from their preferred home venues of Sudi and Mumias, Bernard Mwalala s side are still expected to give Ulinzi a run for their money this afternoon.The soldiers have never won this competition and have seemingly lost their way in the absence of their ailing coach Robert Matano. Ulinzi will be keen to show they have what it takes to finally claim the elusive trophy in a year when the sides that were expected to offer them stiff challenge on paper have already been dismissed.The soldiers will need goal scoring sensation John Makwata to find his scoring boots once again if they are to avoid adding another feather to Nzoia s burgeoning reputation. Prior to this 4pm kick off Western Stima will hope to continue with their recent form as they host KCB. Foward Kenneth Mugambi who received his first international call up after good performances in recent weeks will be hoping to continue playing at that level and power Henry Omino s Stima into the last four.Home advantage will be crucial to Kariobangi Sharks aspirations of reaching their first ever semi finals of a major tournament when they take on holders Bandari.The second tier outfit have been in good nick in recent times with their forward line of Rodgers Omondi, Matthews Odongo and Ibrahimm Kitawi all coming good in front of goal in recent weeks. Bandari will however, take heart from the two goal display of Danny Sserenkuma as they bid to become the first team in a decade to win the trophy back to back. Posta Rangers, meanwhile, will be looking to take full advantage of their reinstatement in the tournament by booking their place in the next round when they clash with Ushuru in the last 16 stage. The winner of this all premier league match up will face Agro Chemiclas in the quarter finals next wednesday.GOtv quarter-finalsKCB v Western StimaNzoia v Ulinzi StarsKariobangi v Bandari FC
