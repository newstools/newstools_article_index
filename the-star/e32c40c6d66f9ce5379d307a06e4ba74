The Parliamentary Service Commission is expected to meet tomorrow to finalise the electoral commission selection panel.The panel is supposed to appoint four people to team up with the five already appointed by religious leaders to oversee the selection of the new IEBC members.The recruitment of the commissioners was to be concluded by September 30, according to the report by the parliamentary committee on the IEBC that has been adopted by Parliament.Yesterday, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale (pictured) said the PSC will get down to work now that its chairman, Speaker Justin Muturi, is back in the country. He was away on official duty. We were waiting for the speaker to come back so we can finalise the issue, Duale told the Star.The delay in assembling the nine-member panel means the appointment of new commissioners to take over from the current team led by Issack Hassan will take longer.Once it concludes with its four nominees, the PSC will submit the entire list of nine to President Uhuru Kenyatta, who will appoint the panel without altering the list. The selection panel will have seven days to advertise the positions of the chairman and six commissioners. It will shortlist and conduct interviews.The panel will then recommend to the President two names for the position of chairman and nine others for the commissioners. Uhuru will pick the chairperson and the six commissioners and send the list to the National Assembly for vetting. It will then go back to the President for formal appointment.
