A helicopter carrying Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto made an emergency landing at Southern Bypass, Nairobi on Sunday evening.The plane could not reach Wilson Airport due to poor visibility caused by heavy rainfall that hit the city, police said.Police said the helicopter, with Rutto and his body guard on board, landed in an open field near the highway at around 6pm."It was guarded at the scene by police after landing and has just left this morning," police said on Monday. The pilot said he had tried to find a way to land at the airport an hour after take-off but noted that it was not possible."I had to make a judgment call and find an alternative field for landing," the pilot said.Last week, two people escaped unhurt after a light aircraft crashed inside Nairobi National Park.
