The East African University has said more than 200 government-sponsored students it admitted could fail to report before tomorrow s deadline.Marketing coordinator Elvis Kisalago told the Star on the phone some students did not provide their contacts, hence got the information late.He also blamed the problem on the short notice given for admission. Kisalago said EAU has been doing all it can to locate some students so they can report before deadline. We have 18 who did not indicate a single contact, he said. For the first time this year, the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service placed 12, 096 government-sponsored students in 29 private universities. We are experiencing problems. The list of students from Kuccps should have been sent to us a month earlier, Kisalago said.
