The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has come under scrutiny in a murder case after a Bungoma High Court judge allowed the family lawyer of deceased university student Mitch Kabiti to prosecute the case.Lawyers for businessman Joseph Waswa, who is charged with murdering Kibiti in a night club in Kimilili in 2014, have challenged the ruling by Judge Abida Aroni.Aroni made the decision on August 17. This allows lawyer George Murunga to actively prosecute the case alongside the DPP.The ruling puts the role of the prosecution s lawyers and the contribution of victims lawyers in criminal proceedings to the test.Judge Aroni said DPP representative Felistus Njeru did not oppose the application filed by Murunga.Jesse Kamau acted for prosecution counsel in a subsequent hearing and opted to oppose the application made by the family lawyer.However, the judge rejected the application and honoured the position earlier taken by Njeru.Defense lawyers J. Amollo and June Ashioya have appealed the decision at the High Court. They want Murunga out of active prosecution, as that could undermine trial. PLO Lumumba (pictured below), who held brief for the defence team, said the ruling could jeopardise the case and the trial. The case will proceed for hearing on October 17.
