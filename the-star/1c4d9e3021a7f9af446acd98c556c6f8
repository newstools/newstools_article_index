A family is appealing for help from well wishers after their son was found with cancer of the blood.David Simiyu was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in April 2015 during his admission to Moi University, school of Medicine.He started treatment at Aga Khan Hospital but results were sub-optimal compelling relatives and friends to take him to India for treatment.David, 19, came back in January 2016 and was declared to be in maintenance phase, having undergone remission. "The progress was good and he later enrolled at Strathmore University for closer monitoring," a relative told the Star on phone.David abruptly relapsed in August and had to be rushed back to India where he needs to undergo stem cell transplant.His transplant is estimated to cost above Sh7 million."We know and trust that he will beat this but he needs financial support to help cover the medical expenses that he, in turn, can focus his energy on getting well," a relative said.Being a lover of art and life, David said he has not been able to wrap his brain around the whole matter."The biggest pill to swallow so far is that this journey will be so long. Treatment is looking like a 2 year process to kick cancer out of me," David said.He said the disease has put him on hold adding "my whole life is being put on hold. No job, no school, so what will my future look like?".To donate, the public are requested to visit youcaring.com and click "donate now".
