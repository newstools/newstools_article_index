David Nkedianye's supporters booed Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery on Saturday after he said the Kajiado Governor will not be reelected unless he defects to Jubilee Party.Nkaissery, who had attended the crowning of the Arroi location chief, ended his speech after the group became uncontrollable.His voice was drowned by noises from the youths as he urged them to respect and listen to him as an elder.The group, calling itself Narresho Fundamentalists , had threatened to disrupt the entire ceremony before the CS left in a huff.They did not listen to him and claimed he disrespected their Governor by saying he would lose the seat by 10 am on election day.Read: Maasai to remain in Jubilee as Ntimama wished, says NkaisseryRead: Do not force Maasai to join Jubilee Party, Narok MP says Arroi location turned unfamiliar for Nkaissery who has never met such opposition since his appointment as Interior CS.The location was once in Kajiado Central constituency but was moved to Kajiado East ahead of the 2013 general elections.The residents had earlier blocked alternative routes to the location in protest against the poor condition of roads in the area.They only left the route to Arroi along Sultan Hamud/Mashuuru road, which is in poor state. The residents closed the other routes so that Nkaissery would be compelled to use the damaged road.The CS has been urging the people of Kajiado to vote for President Uhuru Kenyatta and had made public pronouncements on his pride in being a Jubilee member.But some 156 leaders from the constituency defected from Jubilee to ODM on Friday.Among them was Benjamin Malit, who shot to the limelight after standing by Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko in 2013.Malit shocked a public rally in Arroi when he tore a photo of Tobiko into small pieces and swore to never partner with Jubilee.He said he broke ranks with Tobiko because she refused to heed his advice on various issues he did not specifyThe MP was received by ODM national elections board chairperson Judy Pareno and county ODM chairman Kakuta Maimai.Nkedianye, Nkaissery who once served as Kajiado Central MP and two MCAs from Kajiado West constituency were elected through ODM.The current ongoings indicate residents may change the ruling party s fortunes in the 2017 poll.Read: Raila meets Maasai leaders to quell Uhuru effectAlso read: We will support Jubilee in 2017, Maasai leaders tell Uhuru During the Arroi public rally, speaker after speaker raised the issue of who should succeed the late William Ntimama as Maa community spokesman.Most of those who spoke indicated they would propose Nkedianye.
