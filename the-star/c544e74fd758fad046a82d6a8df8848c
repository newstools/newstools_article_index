Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said his visit in Mombasa is aimed at capturing the county s governor seatHe asked party treasurer Hezron Awiti and secretary general Hassan Omar to unite in ousting current Governor Hassan Joho.Kalonzo said through cooperation, the two will be able to beat Joho, who is also the ODM deputy party leader.He was speaking at a rally at Tononoka grounds on Saturday.He said his team stands a better chance of changing Mombasa because his members are visionary leaders with clout in the electorate.Omar and Awiti have in the past criticised each other, with Awiti accusing Omar of being a dictator, while Omar has discredited Awiti's candidacy in the Mombasa governor's seat.But more recently, the two have been speaking well of one another and have been seen in various functions together.More on this: Omar and Awiti in rare unity as they attend functions togetherAwiti said he is ready to work with anybody, as long as they send Joho home."But note that there is no Governor or deputy yet," he said.Prior to the Saturday rally, Omar had said the both of them have common ground and have noted that the current government has failed fundamentally.Read: Joho may face Omar, Awiti for Mombasa governor seat The SG said they have been appearing to be fighting amongst themselves because of interparty democracy that allows for contest. If you see people have absolute unity, I can point to you an absolute dictator. Don t mistake absolute unity for democracy," Omar said. "Democracy is a divergence where people have separate and distinct vision of arriving to the same goal, he added.Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama asked the two to remain focused on their course. Awiti enjoys massive support from residents drawn from other communities in the country while Omar, who is also Mombasa Senator, draws his support from the Coastal people.Analysts say the Awiti-Omar force could be lethal against Joho, whose choice of deputy will play a crucial role in watering down the Wiper effect. Awiti said their objective is to have a new government steered by the echoes of social democracy of Wiper and will present a united front in the next poll. We shall be focusing on how we will take over the county and return it to the hands of traders. We shall work tirelessly to bring change, he said.According to insiders at the party, the two leaders will be subjected to primaries before any deal is struck.Other leaders who had accompanied Kalonzo said the two should work together to increase the number of governors Wiper party has.They were Senator Mutula Kilonzo (Makueni), MP Jessica Mbalu (Kibwezi) Nairobi deputy Governor Jonathan Mueke and his Machokos counterpart Bernard Kialai among others.
