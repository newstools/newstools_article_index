Two rival factions of Jubilee Party clashed on Saturday afternoon during a meeting that ended prematurely at the former TNA office, Nakuru.The meeting which had been called by James Karimi was disputed after rowdy youths stormed into the meeting and started hurling stones and rotten eggs.Karimi who claimed to have the blessing from jubilee headquarters to hold the meeting was whisked out of the ground as rowdy youths bayed for his blood.The youths accused Karimi and his faction of trying to hijack the leadership of the new party in Nakuru County. They warned that they will not allow him to take the party leadership through the back door.Speaking to the media, Karimi denied allegations that he was launching the Jubilee party and trying to take over its leadership in the county. A section of Mps are the cause of these wrangles. It s unfortunate incident and we condemn it," Karimi said."Our aim was to popularize the party and register new members. Why should they disrupt the meeting."Karimi said it is was not fair that the party members were fighting adding 'those who want to fight should go to opposition.""We need to be united as a party until we receive directions from the Party Headquarters, he said.He added that he knew the party has no officials and they were waiting on the national office to give directions on the same.The struggle to control the Jubilee Party affairs started two months ago in Nakuru after politicians and aspirants started positioning themselves as the party s point men in the region.Hundreds of JP leaders and their supporters on October 8 held a meeting at the former TNA premises and resolved to renovate the office.One camp comprises MPs Joseph Kiuna (Njoro), Nelson Gaichuhie (Subukia), Nderitu Mathenge (Gilgil), David Gikaria (Nakuru Town West) and former Nakuru MP David Manyara.Others are nominated Senator Liza Chelule and Senate aspirant Susan Kihika. She is Nakuru assembly speaker.Members of the other camp fighting to control the party s affairs include Governor Kinuthia Mbugua, Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri and ODM rebel MP Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town West).Both groups are accusing each other of attempting to hijack the party to influence nominations.Nakuru County Aspirants Political Caucus, under the chairmanship of Abdul Noor, said they fear being locked out of the nominations.JP top leaders have said they do not have structures at the grassroots.The Saturday meeting resolved that no officials should be recognised at the county level until the party headquarters gives directions.Simon ole Nasieku, representing the business community in Nakuru, urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene.
