Fida has urged the government to implement the two-thirds gender principle.In a statement yesterday, the federation said the power inequalities have historically limited women s attainment of political rights."This is occasioned by patriarchal systems that do not approve of women s participation in politics, economic inequalities that limit women s economic abilities to finance political campaigns and propaganda that increase vulnerabilities of women to abuse, intimidation and assault during political processes," said the federation.It said the article 27 seeks gender balance in elective and appointive bodies and provides that not more than two-thirds of the members of such bodies shall be of the same gender.Fida said inclusiveness should be the norm.
