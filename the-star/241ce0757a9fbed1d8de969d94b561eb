The government will introduce pay-per-use charges on some high-traffic highways, Infrastructure PS John Mosonik said yesterday.He said tolling is a business and must be done on selected roads to create a return on investment. The PS said policy documents are lined up for discussion by the Cabinet. There must be a policy framework in place to allow investors to operate, Mosonik said at his office.He was accompanied by Kenya National Highways Authority director general Peter Mundinia. The PS said the government faces the problem of sustaining mega road projects for 20-25 years. The budget from the Fuel Levy, which is Sh25 billion, is not enough to maintain the roads, he said.Mosonik said the Northern Corridor is attractive for tolling, as it has many cars, hence the potential for getting returns.He said once the framework is approved by the Cabinet, it will go to Parliament. It will be subjected to public scrutiny, Mosonik said.The PS said tolling system has existed previously and was operated by the government. Highway tolls can be used to expand rural roads, he said, adding that the Thika Superhighway and the Southern Bypass are ready for tolling.Mosonik said structural arrangements on who to coordinate tolling are being worked on, as projects under the KeNHA.He said at the implementation stage, institutional arrangements and the cost of tolling per kilometre will be determined.Mosonik said the Salgaa accident black spot at which many people have died will be redesigned by the government.
