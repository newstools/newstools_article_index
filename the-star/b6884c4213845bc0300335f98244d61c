The Hub Karen is hosting workshops and seminars for its tenants to help them improve retail experience for their clients.The management said their aim is to ensure tenants build a world-class retail landscape locally. The key to good customer service is equipping tenants with the necessary skills for them to deliver an exceptional shopping and lifestyle experience to their customers, The Hub Karen management said in a statement.This comes after a similar initiative by Garden City Mall, which marked its first anniversary this month, following increased competition in the retail sector brought on by mushrooming of malls. Our tenant s success is very important to us at The Hub Karen and we will continuously invest time in supporting them, mall manager Jonathan Yach said.
