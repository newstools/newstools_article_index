Residents of Githogoro slum on Saturday received cash from Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi to start businesses.Wanyonyi distributed motorbikes, car wash machines and kerosene pumps to 15 youth groups.He urged the youth to avoid idleness. I came up with the Mradi Mtaani project to empower the youth economically. Despite living in slums, there is a lot of talent here. Do not despair. We have had great footballers from humble backgrounds. We have seen the less fortunate in society rise and eventually help others. It s also a challenge to you that you should engage in constructive activities, Wanyonyi said.He urged the youth to shun drugs and alcohol. Wanyonyi urged the local administration and the police to support the youth.
