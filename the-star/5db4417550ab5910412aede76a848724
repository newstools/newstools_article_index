Former National Youth Service deputy director general Adan Harakhe (pictured) has absolved himself from blame over the Sh791 million scandal, now an audit question. He told the Public Accounts Committee of the National Assembly he was a whistle blower who helped save millions. Harakhe was questioned on how his appointment as Authority to Incur Expenditure holder was done, how Sh551 million youth savings was used to fund NYS operations and how Sh665 million was paid to suppliers and consultants. I didn t approve the payment of Sh791 million. The impression being created that I am the one who paid isn t true and I need to be spared. I didn t know about it. I only heard about it in the papers, he said.However, Harakhe could not satisfactorily explain why the payments were made just 20 days after his deployment to the service. How do you convince us that you were not part of the scheme, or was it a coincidence that once you came in the payments were made, PAC chairman Nicholas Gumbo asked. This raised curiosity on how Harakhe was deployed to a position that never existed at the NYS, seven days after he was transferred from Bungoma to the Interior ministry. Four days later, he was deployed to the Devolution ministry, where he served for two days before ending up at the NYS. I was the one who raised the issues after I saw the disparities. Saving loss of public funds, Harakhe said. He was explaining how the Sh695 million, which was to be paid to the same firms that received the Sh791 million, was stopped.
