Singer Amani has been off mainstream media for quite sometime. It has been a long time since she churned out a club banger leaving people wondering where she has been.Well, she seems to be trying out something new - filming. Several days ago, she took to her social media to share with her fans what she has been up to.It was a REDVolt Camera. She was basically on set doing "shoot tings". Could she be the next big film maker? Is she planning to drop the next big music video in Kenya? Hmm....let's wait and see.Check out the photos here
