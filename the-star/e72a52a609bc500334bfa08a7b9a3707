Governors have been urged to work closely with the national government to implement key projects.Bomet central MP Ronald Tonui said with the county chiefs putting aside their egos and considering the need for symbiotic collaboration between the two levels of governments, such challenges facing the country can be dealt with amicably. The counties should not be seen to be competing with the national government for projects because their functions are clearly spelt out in the constitution, he said in Bomet town on Saturday. Tonui said unnecessary tug of war between the governments have made projects stall.He said leaders should avoid divisive talk. Tonui faulted Meru Governor Peter Munya for travelling to Somaliland to discuss the temporary ban on miraa exports.He urged Bomet leaders to stop fighting. Tonui said the fights have delayed the construction of a university.
