Embu governor aspirant Kithinji Kiragu has said health workers in the county are promoted or demoted on ethnicity basis.Kiragu, who is a development management consultant, said the Embu administration does not help residents when it fails to promote medical personnel on merit. A person who is promoted on ethnicity and not on merit might differ with fellow workers owing to incompetence. This might even stress him or her, leading to stagnation of the smooth running of the department, he said.Kiragu said discrimination of people in promotions might demoralise the health workers.He termed it naive and stupid for health personnel to be promoted and demoted based on where one comes from, when there are so many qualified but unemployed Kenyans.Kiragu said if this trend continues, services in hospitals will deteriorate. He said merit should be the only consideration for a promotion.Kiragu spoke on the sidelines of the Embu Boda Boda Sacco annual general meeting on Friday. He was reacting to reports by an Embu county assembly s ad hoc committee on the management of the Embu Level 5 Hospital.
