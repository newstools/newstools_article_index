MCAs who disturb the peace during next Thursday's assembly session will be disciplined, speaker Alex Magelo has said.On Thursday, he said MCAs who fight in the assembly are disrespectful.Magelo said Dandora MCA Dan Oria will be punished for starting the brawl last week and throwing a bottle of water at deputy speaker Ken Ngondi.The brawl started when Viwandani MCA Samwel Nyang'wara rose to table an impeachment motion against Governor Evans Kidero.This is the third time the MCAs are fighting in the chamber.Oria rose and grabbed the paper containing the motion from Nyangwara.He then punched Nyangwara and was punched back in defence.It was alleged that Oria was drunk. Several MCAs joined in the fight which lasted 15 minutes. At the same time, women MCAs poured water on the floor and sang songs in praise of Kidero.They condemned Nyangwara for the motion.The Sergeant at Arms and his men were overpowered by the MCAs.They struggled to restore order and Ngondi adjourned the sitting indefinitely.Magelo condemned the violence but said Nyangwara has the right to table any motion."Its important that action will be taken because equipments were destroyed . The MCAs should note that they agreed to the leadership and integrity act in chapter six of the constitution.," he said.Magelo said its wrong for some reps to say that he must be consulted as a person before a motion is tabled .He said the notification is to the office of the speaker and not a person."Its a shame, disgrace and an archaic act to the people of Nairobi," he said.
