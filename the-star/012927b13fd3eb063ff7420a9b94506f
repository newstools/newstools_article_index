Two MCAs from Kisii county who allegedly spent a weekend with three schoolgirls failed to take plea when they were arraigned on Wednesday.Joash Orora (Msimba) and Cosmas Saka (Nyakoe) failed to take the plea after the chief magistrate Jesse Nyaga noted that the charge sheet was defective.State counsel Tom Mbali had wanted the accused to plead to charges of "sexual exploitation contrary to Section 18 of the Penal Code, as read with Section 121 of Sexual Offenses Act".Mbali had wanted the accused to first take plea as they also awaited additional charges based on investigations by police in a week's time.But the magistrate declined and directed Mbali to amend the charge sheet by 2pm. Defence lawyer Edward Begi did not oppose the amendment.Earlier, the court session had been interrupted by residents who complained that it was taking long to arraign the accused, even after they had been brought in at 8am.At some point, court officials were forced to adjourn proceedings and escort the accused out of the premises as protests threatened to become chaotic.Police and court officials restrain members of the public from jamming a court where the two MCAs appeared on October 5, 2016. /BENSON NYANGESIBAWhen the session resumed, the magistrate warned residents against disrupting the court."You are allowed to attend court proceedings but we cannot allow a situation where you disrupt proceedings by making noise. I request that you maintain silence," Nyaga said.The MCAs were arrested at Nyamarambe on Monday after a driver plying the route spotted three schoolgirls in the company of the county reps.The driver said he saw the girls changing from civilian clothes into their school uniforms in a vehicle they were using with the MCAs.County criminal investigation officer Justus Burudi said on Tuesday that the girls were taken to Kisii teaching and Referral Hospital for medical examinations.More on this: Two Kisii MCAs arrested after 'weekend outing' with schoolgirls
