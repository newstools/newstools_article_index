The IEBC has drawn up three possible scenarios about when the new electoral chiefs Could come into office. This includes the possibility of January 2017 seven months to the 2017 general election.In a strategy document seen by the Star, the IEBC anticipates the earliest time a new commission can be in office is November 25.This even after President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday signed into law the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, propelling the process of recruiting the new IEBC bosses.The House team on electoral reforms had proposed that a new commission be in place by September 30, but the deadline may not be achieved. There are fears the delay may threaten the management and integrity of the August 7, 2017 elections after Parliament ruled out the possibility of postponing the polls.The first IEBC scenario considers the maximum time allowable by law and projects the new team could come into office by January 13 next year. Scenario One pushes the time limit to the maximum allowable by law, where such time is prescribed. However, it anticipates where such time is not prescribed, decisions will be made within a realistic time-frame, the strategy paper reads.In the second scenario, the IEBC projects the new team could come in by November 25, if decision makers save time . This looks at the timelines by balancing what is realistic and the demand for quick decision-making within reasonably expected timelines. For example where the law says within the decision makers can save time by making decision much earlier, the commission says. The third scenario is the September 30 proposal by the House team on electoral reforms, which is unlikely to be met.The strategy paper says the new law will be gazetted within seven days after assent by the President.
