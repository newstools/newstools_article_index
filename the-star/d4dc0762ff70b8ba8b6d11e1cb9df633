Kenya Airways is expected to resume normal flight operations starting Tuesday after the pilots association called of an impending strike.The announcement followed a meeting with Kalpa, government stakeholders and Kenya Airways management."Kalpa is pleased to announce that the in-face between pilots of Kenya Airways and the management of the national carrier has been resolved," said the association's secretary general Paul Gichana on Monday.But Gichana said the decision did not amount to a total withdrawal of their strike notice. Instead the strike has been deferred to a later date.More on this: KQ threatens to stop selling tickets over 'unjustified' Kalpa strike notice"We emphasise that we are not retreating from our initial position.
