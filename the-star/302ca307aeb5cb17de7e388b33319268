Twenty-five families in Nanyuki town have been left homeless after a fire gutted their homes in Grogan estate on Monday. The cause of the fire, which started in one of the wooden houses, was not immediately established. Purity Njambi, the owner of the houses, said she was alerted by one of her sons and only managed to save her life. The other families lost all their property as well. Njambi said parents were forced to borrow clothes just so their children could go to school. We appeal to well-wishers, including the Red Cross Society, to come to our aid so we can rebuild our lives, she said. Nanyuki ward MCA Peter Kimondo donated food, bedding and utensils worth Sh250,000 yesterday. He said the town s bylaws outlaw construction of wooden houses. He said there have been more than 50 fires involving wooden houses. Njambi has owned the houses for 30 years.
