Six people were killed Thursday morning during a suspected al Shabaab attack in Mandera Town. The incident happened at about 2am at a residential plot in Bulla public works. The tenants were asleep when the assailants raided the plot. Police said the attackers shot at the victims randomly after they had broken into the plot. The gang used a grenade to break the entrance of the plot before they shot at the tenants and escaped soon after the incident. Police said there were 33 people at the plot at the time of the attack; one person was seriously injured and 25 others rescued. Two people were still missing hours later. Residents said police response was swift and that the attackers were heavily armed. Mandera governor Ali Roba condemned the incident, terming it sad."We have suffered another sad attack," Roba, wrote on Twitter, saying six people had been confirmed killed."If not for the quick response by our security forces, we would be talking of many more casualties now," Roba told Reuters by telephone. "From the nature and style of the attack, it will obviously be al Shabaab."Read: Al Shabaab kill 14 in Mandera as Nkaissery says there was no intelligence before attack
