A leadership wrangle is brewing in Ford Kenya after Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said he has no confidence in secretary general Eseli Simiyu to oversee nominations.Wamalwa said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission should conduct the primaries.He said Eseli favours some candidates and wants to impose them on the party.Wamalwa spoke during a radio talk show on Wednesday.The party chief whip said some aspirants have defected for fear of sham nominations. They quit, saying Eseli has already given their opponents tickets. As long as I am the chief whip, I will ensure the party holds free and fair nominations, Wamalwa said. We are not going to sit back and watch as leaders use their positions to reward their friends. Wamalwa said he has nothing personal against Eseli. We only differ on principle. I respect my party secretary general a lot, but I m telling him he should let people compete fairly in the party, he said.Wamalwa hinted the party could be planning a National Executive Council meeting soon to fill the chairman post previously held by Turkana Senator John Munyes, who defected to the Jubilee Party.
