Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye has said he is concerned about rising tension between two communities living on the Isiolo-Garissa border following clashes over pasture and water. The Boranas are on the Isiolo side while the Aulians are on the Garissa side. His cousin Welly Dekhow was killed last Saturday at Eldere between by armed militias from Isiolo who stole his livestock from his pen. His brother Ahmed Shidiye was injured in the incident.The animals were recovered and returned.Shidiye said late last year, a Borana from Isiolo was killed but his family was compensated in accordance with the Modogashe declaration. The compensation was supposed to bring to an end the long-standing hostilities between the two communities, but last week s killings indicate all is not well, he said.Shidiye said the National Cohesion and Integration Commission should do more to promote peaceful co-existence between the two communities. He said more raids are likely to occur during this dry spell in the region.Shidiye said the two communities have tried to resolve their differences through traditional mechanisms in vain. This is why we want the government and more so the NCIC to prevent more bloodshed, he said.Shidiye thanked security teams from the two counties and area security committees for ensuring stolen animals are recovered. He urged them to continue working closely and remain vigilant.It took the government's intervention to stop clashes between farmers from Tana River and pastoralists from Masalani in Garissa county. At least five people were killed.
