Nairobi lacks an adequate supply of quality logistics space, pushing some firms to invest in their own custom-built facilities, a survey by Knight Frank has established.The Knight Frank Logistics Africa 2016 report a review of sub-Saharan Africa s emerging logistics property sector notes that occupiers of prime warehouses want properties built to high technical specifications that support modern retailing, distribution and manufacturing practices.As a result, the scarcity of high quality warehouses in Nairobi has created abundant opportunities for developers, even on a speculative basis. Prime logistics space in the capital currently commands a rent of $4.2 (Sh425.34 ) per square meter per month, a relatively low figure largely due to the quality of existing structures, the report released on Wednesday reads.The city s existing stock is old and mainly based in Industrial Area, the survey notes.Knight Frank Kenya Managing Director Ben Woodhams said occupiers are willing to pay about $6 (Sh607.6) per square metre per month in Nairobi for the same quality of space they would find in South Africa or Eastern Europe.
