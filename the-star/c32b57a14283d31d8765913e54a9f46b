A Mombasa court has issued warrants for the arrest of two Lamu MCAs who failed to honour summonses.Resident magistrate Martin Rabera said Monica Kirunyu (Nominated) and Anthony Maina (Bahari) were to appear in court over charges of incitement to violence.Rabera said they did not give proper explanations for their absence.But their lawyer Caroline Mboku said her clients, being laymen, had not understood they were supposed to appear at the Mombasa court. My clients understood the summonses as asking them to appear at the Chief Magistrates Court in Nairobi, not Mombasa, she said.But the magistrate cautioned her against lying saying the investigating officer, through assistant DPP Alexander Muteti, said the two had earlier been at the premises.Rabera also said the MCAs were learned, judging by the nature of their jobs, therefore should not claim they misunderstood the summonses.Muteti asked the court to issue the warrants as the ward representatives were served on October 12.He said it was explained that they were to appear at the court in Mombasa. I apply for warrants of arrest since the two were aware of the proceedings and would like the court to deal with them accordingly," he said.Muteti produced a letter by Mogaka Omwenga and Mabeya Advocates asking for the plea-taking to be deferred as the accused were pursuing an out of court settlement.The complaint was filed by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission through the office of the Director of Public Prosecutiona.The magistrate said the two MCAs will take plea on October 25.
