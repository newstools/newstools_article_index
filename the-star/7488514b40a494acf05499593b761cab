The SGR route that slices through the Nairobi National Park is the only viable option and will not disrupt wildlife significantly, Transport CS James Macharia has assured. We said let s look at the entire park and agree which is the least destructive and disruptive. The team came up with seven options, which were analysed individually and given to the KWS. They recommended the option that we are now going with, he said in an interview on Thursday with the Star.The second Nairobi-Naivasha section will be launched on October 19 in Naivasha. Conservationists have protested against the proposed route. They want the standard gauge railway to pass elsewhere. But the CS says other options were considered and found unviable. If not going through the park, the railway will have to go to Syokimau freight station, then back to Athi River. Imagine the inefficiencies. It would be non-operational. In reality, this was the only option, he said.The National Environment Tribunal last week stopped construction of the section, known as phase 2A. Activist Okiyah Omtatah and the Kenya Coalition for Wildlife Conservation filed an application against the National Environmental Management Authority, Kenya Wildlife Service, China Road and Bridge Corporation, Kenya Railways Corporation, the Attorney General and the Environment and Transport ministries.Tribunal chairman JK Awuor in a letter dated September 1 stopped the planned construction on grounds that Nema did not conduct a proper feasibility study. He gave the respondents 21 days to answer. We took the KWS board airborne to survey the seven alternatives. We took the Cabinet Secretary [Judy Wakhungu] and then left the matter with KWS to recommend any or none of the possible routes. They deliberated and recommended the route we have settled on, after considering all possible negative effects, Macharia said.
