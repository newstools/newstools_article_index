Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said he deserves a second term in office as his development record speaks for itself.Oparanya said he was confident his accomplishments will lead to his re-election in the August 8, 2017 general election. As first governors, since the inception of devolution, we have spent the last three years putting in place structures. It is only fair that we are re-elected to now deliver service to the people, he said.Oparanya asked his opponents to prepare for a tough battle as it will not be a walk in the park.He will face Senator Bonny Khalwale, businesswoman Marble Muruli and former medical services minister Amukowa Anangwe.Oparanya has been traversing the county, checking the progress of projects he launched in the last three years.The trips have been as part of his efforts to garner support before the election.The Governor spoke in his office on Wednesday during the swearing in of eight members of the County Administrative Boundaries Committee.They are Odongo Kapita, Jacob Omumia, Phibi Muleshe, Bernard Kiprotich, Hannington Munyendo, Joseph Kimtai, Silas Ondari and Aziza Rajab.The committee conducts public hearings and proposes the number of villages and community units to be created in the county. We want to do it differently from the national government which looks at the provincial administration as the only security provider," said Oparanya. "The community units will deal with all departments at that level instead. He said the county will concentrate on the community units for now and implement the village units when funds are available.Oparanya said in July that he respects President Uhuru Kenyatta and will work with the national government for the sake of the people.He said the the government and opposition must cooperate to achieve development since they serve the same people.More on this: I will remain in ODM but work with Uhuru, Ruto - Oparanya
