Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has said that the ODM rally scheduled for Sunday at Masinde Muliro grounds in Mathare will go on.He told the press at Orange House on Friday that the meeting, deemed as one of the biggest event to be held by the party, will proceed without any hitch.Kidero said supporters led by ODM leader Raila Odinga will attend the rally despite claims by Mathare MP Stephen Kariuki that the venue had been booked for a Jubilee event.&quot;This is going to be the mother of all the rallies held in this city by the party in the recent past. It is going to be bigger than what happened in Mombasa last weekend,&quot; Kidero, the custodian of City county property among them venues for public rallies, said.Read: Showdown looms as ODM, Jubilee plan parallel rallies in Mathare on SundayThe briefing was attended by ODM acting secretary general and nominated Senator Agnes Zani, MPs Tom Kajwang&#39; (Ruaraka) and Simba Arati (Dagoretti North).ODM rally will be a culmination of a series of events organised by the party in Nairobi to celebrate its ten years of existence.The meeting will also be used to popularize Raila&#39;s 2017 presidential election bid.The rally comes hot on the heels of a similar one led by Mombasa governor Hassan Joho last Saturday.Zani said the party will also conduct a roadshow traversing Kawangware, Kibra, Kariokor, Mlango- Kubwa, Eastleigh, Dandora before the procession ends at Masinde Muliro grounds.Claims by the Mathare MP, who was elected on an ODM ticket and has since shifted his allegiance to Jubilee party, may just spoil the Orange party&#39;s celebrations.A letter circulated by the MP shows that has also booked the venue for a mass civic education on the development programmes he has initiated in the area.But ODM MPs Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja), Kajwang&#39; and Arati, dismissed Kariuki. They likened him to &quot;a child who passes stool on the plate that food is served&quot;&quot;The grounds we have booked do not belong to Kariuki, they belong to the county government of Nairobi. He will not believe what will sting him if he continues with this ambivalent behaviour,&quot; Kajwang&#39; said.Wandayi, who is also the party&#39;s Secretary for Political Affairs, said that if Jubilee has anything to do, they should wait for another day.&quot;These are some of the old, tired tactics dating back to the anti-IEBC protest rallies, the Jubilee administration is trying to employ by double booking our venues. They want to frustrate us but we will not accept,&quot; Wandayi said.Read: ODM marks 10 years, aims to reassert might, fight JubileeHe continued: &quot;That boy must know that he is fraudulently benefiting from an ODM seat. He is a non entity who rode on the party&#39;s wave but his goose is now cooked,&quot;&quot;He is not a person we should be speaking of at this moment. Kariuki is a man who rarely opens his mouth to contribute to debates in the National Assembly,&quot; Arati said.
