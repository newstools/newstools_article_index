It is very perturbing that such non-factual reports can be published without verification," he said.Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire seconded Rop noting the allegations will taint the reputation of the committee and its members."If there is any member who is corrupt, why doesn t the paper name and shame the individual instead of dragging the name of all members in the mud," he said.Chairman Nicholas Gumbo said they will not take the allegations lightly and will summon Ndolo to substantiate his claims.The issue of the malicious publication was brought forth when the watchdog committee met DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro.Muhoro presented a criminal investigation report on the scandal.
