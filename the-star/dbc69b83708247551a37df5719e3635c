Kenya has hosted the largest number of refugees in the world in the last three decades and the burden our country has continued to endure remains disproportionate to support received, the CS said. She spoke during the 71st Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA71) at UN headquarters in New York.Amina defended the decision to close Dadaab saying there was adequate evidence the camp has been infiltrated by terrorists' cells.She noted its populations had declined by at least 150,000 by the end of 2016. I must mention that refugees have been living in crowded, insecure and squalid conditions that are simply unacceptable," she said. "The closure of Dadaab camp, which has been in existence for over 25 years, will therefore not only end a life of decades in exile, but also enable the refugees to regain their human dignity."
