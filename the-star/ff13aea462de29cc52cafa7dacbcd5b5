Residents of Eastleigh have asked the police to speed up investigations and help trace two missing guards who went missing five days ago.The residents told the Star the guards went missing after a gang broke into Moyale Mall and killed two other guards and stole electronic goods worth millions."We are not sure if they were abducted. We really want to know if they are alive or dead. They are our fellow human beings and we have to be concerned," resident Pius Mwangi said.According to residents, the gang broke into more than 10 shops.The residents said they are also tracing the relatives of the missing guards.However, Eastleigh hawkers dismissed the story of the missing guards."We believe this is stage-managed to serve the interests of the mall owners, who are blaming hawkers for the raid," Jeff Oteba, the Eastleigh Hawkers' Association chairman, said.
