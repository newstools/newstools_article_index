The Okoa Watu Wetu Initiative has been launched to restore the productive lives of alcoholics in Nairobi. This follows the realisation that despite legislative attempts to curb excessive drinking, some 6,000 Kenyans still die annually due to alcohol-related problems.According to the National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse, illicit liquor is still popular among Kenyans, mainly due to poverty and joblessness.Nacada reported that more than two million Kenyans need counselling and rehabilitation. The Okoa Watu Wetu Initiative seeks to provide rehabilitation and support systems for victims in Nairobi aged between 16 and 64 years.It brings together church leaders, professionals, youth leaders and health experts who will identify victims and offer them help. Karen Nyamu, an aspirant for Nairobi woman representative, launched the initiative in Kayole.
