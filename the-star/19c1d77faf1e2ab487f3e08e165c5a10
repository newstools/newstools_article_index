Syphilis patients must get an injection in the buttocks or upper thighs close to their groin as part of the new regulations to tackle resistance to antibiotics.The Ministry of Health said this should not be viewed as punishment but a response to the growing resistance to antibiotics.Previously, syphilis sufferers used oral tablets, but the World Health Organisation recommends an injection of benzathine penicillin.Health CS Cleopa Mailu said Kenya endorsed the global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, which binds the country to adopt new strategies to fight resistance.Last month, WHO issued new guidelines for treatment of syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Resistance of these STIs to the effect of antibiotics has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced treatment options, it says. WHO said the bacteria are more immune as a result of misuse and overuse of the drugs.It said quinolones, a class of antibiotics commonly used in Kenya to treat gonorrhoea, has lost its potency.Speaking in New York yesterday, Dr Mailu asked donors to support Kenya to roll out its National Action Plans to fight antibiotics resistance. International development agencies need to provide assistance and support by integrating antimicrobial resistance prevention as a core component of their work in low resource settings, he said at a forum on sustainable access to effective antibiotics.The world is facing a growing number of superbug infections that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Countries are now fighting to stop a future where treatable diseases become pandemic and deadly.Mailu said Kenya began to fight against the resistance in the 1990s.He intimated that the Pharmacy and Poisons Board will be revamped. The process of establishing the Kenya Food and Drugs Authority is underway and will help strengthen the weak regulatory framework that affects the pharmaceutical supply chain, the CS said. The Agriculture ministry will also fight misuse of antibiotics in animals, he said.Bacteria develop antibiotic resistance in two ways many acquire mutations in their own genomes that allow them to withstand antibiotics, because of repeated and improper use of the drugs.Other bacteria rely on a shortcut they get infected with something called a plasmid, a small piece of DNA carrying a gene for antibiotic resistance. That makes resistant genes more dangerous because plasmids can make copies of themselves and transfer the genes to others.
