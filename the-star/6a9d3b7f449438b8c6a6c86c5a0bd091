President Uhuru Kenyatta has warned government officials against denying youth opportunities to work with or for the government.Uhuru asked the Public Service and Treasury ministries to ensure all youth projects are paid for on time."You must take action against accounting officers who are delaying (payments to) the youths. They need money to grow," he said at the Youth Summit at State House in Nairobi on Monday.The President further asked the Public Service ministry to address NYS challenges and reignite projects which were halted early this year."We all have problems and we must fix them, (but we must) not stop projects when problems arise," he said adding the rate of crime in Kibera reduced when the NYS was carrying out projects,"We should capitalise on issues that help reduce, if not stop crime in our country."Read: Youth are taking up few tenders - PPOAAlso read: Youth are ignorant of tender conditionsUhuru also challenged Kenyans to focus on issues of development, not negativity, saying the government has done a lot for the people."Kenyans and journalists should learn about the positive things the government is doing. We must learn to focus on what is helping our lives and the future of Kenya," he said.The President asked the opposition to positively criticise issues affecting the country to help empower the people and build a strong united and stable society."If we had an opposition focused on issues, it would be good for everyone because positivity boosts us. If the world sees the good in us, we should see even better," he said.Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja said the government will soon publish a 'list of shame' of all ministries that do not observe tendering requirements."We are soon going to release the list of ministries and counties that do not give youth tenders. The youth don't want to be defined by statistics, they want to be defined by opportunities and success," he said.Read: Sakaja writes to PPOA over youth, women s tenders
