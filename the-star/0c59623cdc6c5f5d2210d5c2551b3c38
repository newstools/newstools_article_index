And all officers should learn from their colleagues in Mombasa and be prepared at all times to deal with such elements, he added.He asked the public to be vigilant at all times and report any suspicious activities to security agencies warning that anyone caught habouring or aiding terror suspects will be considered equally guilty. Terrorists aim at mass murder of indiscriminate people, so when you keep quiet, you don t know whose lives you are putting at risk, he said.Kiraithe further called on the youth to resist attempts to be radicalised into causing bloodshed on the promise of paradise.He advised them to instead exploit the economic opportunities around them to earn a living for themselves.He said that the fact that terror elements have now resorted to using na ve groups of people in the society like youthful women to execute their criminal activities is indicative of the country s security apparatus alertness to detect criminal activities.
