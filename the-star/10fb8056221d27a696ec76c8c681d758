A stray bullet from an Administration Police officer's gun killed two women at Daraja Mbili open air market in Kisii on Thursday, a police brief claims. Area chief Brian Mose said a quick response team from county headquarters was on patrol when they met an irate mob that wanted to lynch a suspect.Witnesses said the demonstrators engaged police in running battles and lit bonfires on the highway, blocking it."This prompted the officers to intervene and in the process, one shot in the air to disperse the mob," Mose is quoted as saying, in an internal police briefing sent to the Inspector General on Friday.He said the stray bullet hit two women who were selling vegetables at the market and killed them, but this is still a mystery.One of the victims was identified as Irene Kerubo, 36, who was shot in the abdomen. She succumbed to her injuries at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital where she was rushed.Edna Bosibori, 21, died at the scene after she was shot in the chest. The bodies were taken to the hospital's mortuary for post mortem examinations."The scene turned violent and riotous causing a huge traffic jam leading to robbing of motorists and also looting of shops," said Mose.He said investigations were underway and hat progress reports would follow.Attempts to reach the Kisii OCPD for comment were futile.
