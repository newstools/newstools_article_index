A Young Kenyan entrepreneur has created a novel concept of information technology for the benefit of people involved in court cases. The concept called FAMALIA is an SMS-based initiative.It seeks to empower people to conveniently get information on succession and land-related cases. Its name was coined from two Swahili words familia (family) and mali (property).The initiative allows the public to query and find out the status of any succession cases via SMS. It also empowers the public to get SMS s showing the detailed procedures followed in the succession process. 28-year-old Mathew Egesa said about 1 million people are listed as defendants in the pending succession and land cases. FAMALIA is a principal solution, the first of its kind in Kenya and Africa. We have recently partnered with the judiciary, through the Kadhis court, where we will run the pilot project, he said.
