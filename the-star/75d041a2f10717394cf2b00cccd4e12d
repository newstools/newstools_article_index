The relationship between State officers working at the EACC and the Devolution ministry has become an issue of animated debate within the corridors of power. Despite being mentioned in a litany of scandals in the ministry and the National Youth Service, an official in the ministry has totally refused to honour summonses to appear before the EACC. What angers the powers-that-be is the inability or refusal of a senior official at the EACC to order his arrest for snubbing such summons. Those in the know say the the EACC official could actually be the one protecting the guy from the ministry. *********Just who was responsible for dressing President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and their wives for the Jubilee Party launch? Questions have been raised on why Mrs Kenyatta was dressed in an oversize branded shirt while Mrs Ruto wore a round neck T-shirt. Further, while Uhuru had a red football jacket branded "Uhuru 2017", Ruto had to wear a maroon jacket, which is said to have been collected from his office after he had arrived at the Jubilee Party headquarters and ferried to him at high speed. *********A senior county official facing a corruption case in a South Rift county is busy trying to assist a school principal in the county in doctoring procurement documents. The two are said to be "meeting" daily in the school's boardroom to assist in the 'cleansing' exercise that sometimes goes on till midnight. The locals wonder whether the senior official really still works for Office of the President or has now moved to the ministry of Education! *********Who is fooling who between Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and aspirant Yvonne Khamati? The two made a public appearance together and even had lunch, raising eyebrows all round. Whereas Sonko has declared his interest in the Governor position, Khamati is seeking to replace him as the Senator from Nairobi. But people close to Sonko have downplayed the public appearance and accuse Khamati s group of taking advantage of an accidental meeting to make political capital. *********A cabinet Minister is openly asking for kickbacks from every business deal that is taken to him for approval. The CS tells his associates, without shame, that he will only give his approval to any project if he is given his 10 percent in advance. This excuse is that he is fund raising for next year s elections.
