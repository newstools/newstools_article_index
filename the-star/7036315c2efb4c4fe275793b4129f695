Ford Kenya will not accept any joint Cord nominations in its strongholds, officials said on Friday citing Bungoma county as one of the areas they will field candidates in all seats.Secretary general Eseli Simiyu asked their partners in the coalition to consider not fielding candidates for governor, woman rep, MPs and MCAs in the countyThe Tongren MP said that only Ford Kenya party has structures in Bungoma unlike the other parties whose presence is only on papers, as they lack offices."We don't want ODM and Wiper to field candidates in Bungoma. This is purely a Ford Kenya zone. Let our friends field their candidates in other regions where they are strong," he said.Eseli noted that in 2013, they lost many seats after affiliate parties in Cord fronted aspirants for the seats and would not want the same to be repeated in the 2017 polls. Bungoma county has 45 wards and 9 constituencies, which he said Ford Kenya will all have strong candidates."We have strong candidates in Ford Kenya and we are not going to allow our partners to compete with us in our region. We need to have a say politically," Eseli said.Read: Cord plans retreat to decide proposal on joint nominations Eseli said that they have began to popularise Ford Kenya across Bungoma and Trans Nzoia ahead of next year s general election."We will open more offices so that we can effectively campaign for the next president, who is none other than the party leader Moses Wetang'ula," he said.Wafula Wamunyinyi, Ford Kenya Bungoma chairman and Kanduyi MP, said that the party s nominations will be free and fair.He asked members to be loyal to the party and support Wetang'ula's bid to capture the country s top seat.Apart from Bungoma, Ford Kenya wants areas in western Kenya zoned so as to restrict parties like ODM from fielding its candidates those that they (Ford-K) cut out.Ford Kenya is perceived to be popular in western, being home of Wetang'ula and deputy party leader Boni Khalwale (Kakamega senator).However, the party has fewer parliamentary seats in the region, compared to ODM whose leader Raila Odinga and his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka have proposed that they field candidates as a coalition.Read: Raila backs Kalonzo in push for joint Cord nominationsAlso read: Raila pledges free, fair Cord nominations
