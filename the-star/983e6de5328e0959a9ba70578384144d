A witness in the controversial Sh1.8 billion Anglo Leasing fraud case has said that the contracts under probe were done in line with procurement laws and were above board.Kenneth Mwangi, a director of procurement at the National Treasury, said on Tuesday that the contracts were perfectly executed.Mwangi said: "There was no evidence of a conspiracy as the process adhered to prevailing regulations,"The witness was testifying in a case in which former Finance minister David Mwiraria, three PSs , businessmen Rashmi Kamani and Deepak Kamani are charged with conspiracy to defraud the government in the procurement of modern police surveillance equipment."There was nothing untoward in the procurement," Mwangi said in his testimony before court, adding that Mwiraria went for "direct procurement" as the transaction was security related.Mwangi said that the minister had power to direct the method to be used in procurement under the exchequer audit procurement regulations.Mwiraria, the court heard, was also empowered by law to authorise the signing of the contract against provisions in the External Loans Act whose payment period was later revised from 48 to 66 months. He said the process was not "a one-off affair" but was subjected to "every possible scrutiny by treasury and involved many government agencies". The witness said that correspondences between the state agents involved in the procurement, who were later charged with offences, showed "no evidence of a conspiracy"."They were done under perfect and normal workings of government. Nothing in the procurement procedures followed suggested any conspiracy, this is how the government works," Mwangi said.The court heard that the Attorney General approved the contract which to date has not been invalidated.Another witness, Monica Muthoni - chief accountant at the Kenya Police service - said payment vouchers involved in the transaction were made at the Office of the President."They were all in the estimate books for the financial year, the prices were fair and reasonable, " the witness said. She concurred in cross examination that the government expenditure on the police upgrade project was "properly incurred having been voted for and okayed by parliament."Read: Mudavadi absolves Senator Obure from Sh10b Anglo Leasing case
