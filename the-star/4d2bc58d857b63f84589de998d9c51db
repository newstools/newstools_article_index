Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said those claiming he plans to leave Cord are the same people involved in a conspiracy to block him from becoming president.Kalonzo said he had proven wrong the many people who doubted he would stay in the opposition, as it it a difficult place to be in Africa. It is ridiculous for one to imagine that I can be enticed with the position of foreign affairs minister to join Jubilee. I have held the position twice under retired presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki, he said.He spoke on Radio Jambo on Thursday morning in response to a local daily cartoon that depicted him as a chameleon slowly changing from orange to red, which is one of Jubilee Party's colours.Kalonzo said the Cord coalition was intact and that he will not defect. He added that he, leader Raila Odinga and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula will "definitely agree" on a flag bearer ahead of the August 8, 2017 general election."I will not leave cord. It is not a must that we agree on everything. Having different views does not mean we have differed," he said.Read: Cord to pick flagbearer in JanuaryBut the Cord co-principal said his stay in the opposition must come with the assurance of defeating Jubilee in the next election.He said he was ready to sacrifice his ambition in support of another candidate as long as a win is guaranteed, and added that Cord I am ready to sacrifice many more times but there must be reciprocity because this business of 'leaving for others' then we lose is not making sense, he said.Read: I will beat you hands down, Raila tells Uhuru after ODM endorsement for presidentKiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi earlier asked Kalonzo to join Jubilee to avoid being "boxed into a situation" by his coalition partners in 2017.Wamatangi said Kalonzo's party would be welcome as he is free to form a government with anyone for the good of the people. We must respect Kalonzo s democratic right to make his own decisions," he said on the Citizen TV breakfast show on Thursday morning.Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, who was also on the show, told off leaders who have painted Kalonzo as indecisive saying it was a demeaning take on him. People must be careful with the narrative they create because such caricature is in bad faith, and demeaning to Kalonzo's political status as a former Vice President and MP, he said.Wiper Democratic Movement has strengthened its push for Kalonzo to be picked as Cord s presidential candidate.Some Ukambani Mps have been pushing for the Cord co-principal to make a decision and chart the community's political destiny.MPs Joe Mutambu (Mwingi North), Francis Mwangangi (Yatta), Richard Makenga (Kaiti), Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni), who joined Jubilee Party, said they will make the decision if Kalonzo fails to by November 15.Regarding the Sh6.8 underground water collector tunnel project, Kalonzosaid it could be another scheme of corruption by the Jubilee government. I suspect this is just a scheme by some people to collect kickbacks and go away. I am going to follow this development keenly, he said.Read: Jubilee's Sh6.8bn secret water project will turn counties to deserts - RailaAlso read: State hits out at Raila over 'secret water', Wamalwa says ex-PM launched project in 2012Kalonzo asked Murang'a residents not to view themselves as targets. He said that the project will affect millions of people whose livelihood depends on Tana River, should the water source run dry.He said that a full brief on whether environmental assessment was done must be made public before the project begins.Kalonzo added that the Jubilee government had no projects of its own and was only implementing what the Grand Coalition government started. Jubilee has failed the country because they rely on the narrative that those who do not support them will not get development, which is a right for all Kenyans," he said.He added that tribalism has risen to levels never experienced before in Kenya.
