A warrant of arrest was issued on Friday against pensions director Shem Nyakutu for failing to obey court orders.Lady Justice Janet Mulwa of Nakuru directed Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to arrest and bring the pension boss to court."The director of pensions has failed to comply with orders that required him to attend court despite having conversations with state counsel Wachira Anguyo on the issues of payment of the retired teachers," said Justice Mulwa.The court also ordered that Nyakutu be brought before it to explain why he failed to attend proceedings.He is also wanted to explain why he failed to honour the promise he made in court regarding the disbursement of Sh1.5 billion in 30 days to teachers who retired from 1997 onward.On August 15, Nyakutu was present before the same court and he said the office of the pensions had discussions with the TSC on how to roll out the payments.Read: Courts orders retired teachers paid Sh1.5 billion in 30 days He said that they had Sh1.5 million at their disposal, and assured the court that they shall have paid the retirees some money within 30 days.Nyakutu was required to send the money to the retirees accounts and give the court a report on Friday, September 16 on the unpaid amount.But Dominic Kimata, who represented 52,000 retirees, refuted the claim saying the payment process has been frustrating.He reported that no single penny has been deposited in the retirees accounts despite Nyakutu s promise."My clients have not received a single penny. The efforts to try and get in touch with the office has been fruitless. There is no evidence of payment at all," said Kimata.Kimata asked to the court to order the arrest of Nyakutu so that he pays the price of contempt for deliberately, intentionally disregarding the orders.Cavin Anyuor, representing the Teachers Commission, told the court that the TSC has processed 18,000 forms of the retirees and forwarded the same to director of pensions for payment.Read: TSC chief to appear in court to explain why retired tutors yet to get their Sh4bn However, the director of pension picked only 100 forms.Anyuor told the court that the last volume of retiree s files will be finished within seven days and forwarded to the direction of pensions for payments.Representing the office of Attorney General and the director of pensions, State counsel Wachira Anguyo told the court that the director had told him during a conversation that they have started the disbursement to the retirees of 1997.The court also ruled that the TSC s Chief Executive Officer continues to balance the forms and report to court on the progress.The office of the AG will confirm compliance with the order and commencement of payment when the case is mentioned on September 23.
