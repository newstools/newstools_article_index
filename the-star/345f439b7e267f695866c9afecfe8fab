Harambee Sand Stars were bundled out of the Africa beach soccer Cup after suffering a heavy 7-1 thrashing at the hands of the hosts Ghana in Accra Ghana on Sunday. Ghana Black Sharks as the Ghana beach team is popularly known, humiliated Kenya 10-03 in the first leg match in Mombasa, leaving Kenya with a daunting task of erasing the five-goal deficit in Ghana.Kenya coach Rajab Babu while praising the team for a brave fight, attributed the loss to inadequate preparations and lack of quality players who can rise to the occasion. Most of our best players ply their trade with Premier League clubs, who refused to release them considering the league is at a critical stage and this seriously affected us, Brazilian trained Babu said. He asked Football Kenya Federation to ensure there is a permanent beach team in place which can be called upon to represent the country even on short notice. It is unfortunate that we only assemble when there is a tournament and this shouldn t be the case, he said.
