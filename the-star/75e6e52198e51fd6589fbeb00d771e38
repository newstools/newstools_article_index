Journalists should adhere to the Code of Ethics and be guided by the responsibility of promoting the well-being of the society in their reporting, Central regional coordinator Naftali Mung athia has said.He urged them to be objective when reporting, especially during the election and campaigns periods.This will stop the heightening of political temperatures, Mung'athia said. I have noted that the political temperatures in the region are rising as politicians jostle for party positions and in the run-up to the General Election next year. As a result, the region is bound to see increasing incidents of violence or incitement to violence as politicians try to outdo each other, he said on Wednesday.
