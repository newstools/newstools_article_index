Nyando MP Fred Outa has demanded the immediate removal of several police roadblocks mounted on Nyanza roads.Outa said the "illegal roadblocks" are used by police officers to extort money from members of the public.He said the police officers manning the barriers have abandoned their duties and are engaging in money minting exercise."The officers do not carry out the mandatory checks and instead engage the conductors of the public service vehicles in corruption by collecting money from them," Outa said.He made the comments while he was addressing his supporters after being released on bail. He cited Kisumu as one of the areas with many illegal police roadblocks.Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga, Kisumu Central ODM treasurer Edward Ogola and Kisumu MCAs were in solidarity with Outa while in court.Outa, who spent the night at Kisumu Central police station for inciting Ahero Girls secondary students, was released on bond of Sh300,000 or alternative cash bail of Sh100,000.Read: Nyando MP Fred Outa to spend night in cell for inciting Ahero students to protest Also read: MP Outa released on Sh300,000 bond in Ahero Girls demo caseHe said the notice they gave to County police commander Titus Yoma over the illegal roadblocks in the county has expired.Outa said leaders from Kisumu will rally residents in a peaceful protest against the roadblocks in the region"You cannot have more than nine roadblocks from Awasi to Kisumu town. It unacceptable because some senior officers are using them to fleece public of their hard earned money," he said.The legislator said the government should inform the public of the gazetted roadblocks to erase suspicion of those that exist outside the law.He questioned why there are many roadblocks in Nyanza region than other regions, adding that it amounts to intimidation of innocent Kenyans. The MP said accidents at several black spots in the region could not be reduced due to corruption among senior officers.Kisumu City Residents Voice Association chairman Audi Ogada said the officers concentrated at the roadblocks instead of reducing surging crime in the region."At every stop, the conductors give between Sh50 and Sh100 to the officers manning the roadblocks," he said.He asked Nyanza Regional Police coordinator Willy Lugusa to ensure to ensure sanity is restored on the roads.
