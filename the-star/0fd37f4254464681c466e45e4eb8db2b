Opposition chief Raila Odinga is said to be more serious than ever about his 2017 stab at the presidency. Last week, the Cord leader made a move that surprised most people in his inner circle. Raila, known for always trying to please all his friends, is whispered to have literally chased away one of his former aides. The ex-Prime Minister is said to have stood up from his seat and asked the man to leave his office and never come back. Those close to him are still wondering what could have transpired to culminate in this scene. The said aide has a strong presence on social media and has always portrayed himself as very close to the Raila family. Well, those in the know say the ODM boss is uncomfortable with those using his name for selfish gain.**********That politicians can sometime be greedy, especially in Kenya, is not in doubt. Well, nothing exemplifies this more than the feeling of some Mt Kenya politicians. These politicians are upset by an activist from the region whom they accuse of spoiling their soup. The politicians were over the weekend overheard contemplating what to do with the activist, whom they claim is attacking a senior Jubilee party official from Rift Valley who has been financing their weekend expenditures and is their hope of winning the 2017 elections.**********A flamboyant city business mogul of Asian extraction is said to be increasingly under siege in recent days, following his serial penchant for entrepreneurial malpractices and engagement in unethical business conduct. The tycoon is said to be on the radar of the tax collector and saturation surveillance watch by the state legal apparatus over a number of meddlesome affairs he has been involved in right, left and centre. Seeing he s cornered, the man of means has resorted to desperately seeking protection from a very senior politician, who it seems is his last refuge and hope for much-needed relief and rescue.**********Are some ODM legislators terminally fed up with Wiper leader and Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka? The ODM legislators are tired of Musyoka s pressure on their leader Raila Odinga to have the opposition Coalition s 2017 flagbearer named before the end of the year, against Raila s next March proposal. It is said the MPs are particularly fed up with Musyoka s rhetoric that he should be handed the Cord ticket because he has suffered and sacrificed a lot for others political ambitions. The MPs have even said the ultimatum and threats issued by Musyoka and his party members to ODM to desist from considering itself better than Wiper and Ford Kenya is a scheme to end their 2017 momentum to remove Jubilee from power.
