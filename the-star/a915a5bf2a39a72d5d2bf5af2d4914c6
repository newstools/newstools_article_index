The bodies of twins Maimuna and Ramla Abdulrahman Hussein were released from the Coast General Hospital on Saturday evening after postmortems and buried in the Manyimbo cemetery.The two were killed alongside Tasnim Yakub on September 11 during a botched terror attack at the Central police station, Mombasa. Yakub s body is yet to undergo a postmortem as no one has claimed it.But Muhuri chairman Khalif Khelef claimed the pathologist was compromised since he did not invite any human rights activists, IPOA or the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights officials to the postmortems.IPOA board chairman Macharia Njeru said he will meet his team tomorrow on the way forward. Police spokesperson Charles Owino told the Star they are yet to receive findings from the anti-terrorism police unit in Mombasa.Detectives from the ballistics department will release a report on the source of the bullet found in one of the bodies. It was handed over for investigations. One [of the women was] totally burnt and the other had at least four bullet wounds, government pathologist Johansen Oduor said.
