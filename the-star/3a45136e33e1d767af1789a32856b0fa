Western residents should back Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula for President as he has a higher chance of winning the election as opposed to the other two Cord co-principals, two Bungoma MPs have said.Bungoma county Ford Kenya chairman Wafula Wamunyinyi (Kanduyi MP) and Ford Kenya nominated MP Patrick Wangamati said Wetang'ula is the youngest of the three Cord co-principals."Ford Kenya will be asking for a joint nomination in Cord," Wamunyinyi said."We want whoever will be the flagbearer to remove the Jubilee government that has made life unbearable to Kenyans with rampant corruption and a high cost of living."The MP said if the three Cord co-principals run for election on their own parties next year, Jubilee will easily win.They should stick together and support whoever wins the nominations so they can send Jubilee leaders home.Wamunyinyi denied there is discord in Cord, saying the three parties in the coalition are only popularising their parties but will unite for election. "We are only fighting to give our parties strength and we will reach somewhere and converge and become one strong team," he said.The legislator urged leaders to support Wetang'ula even before nominations."We want those leaders and electorates who have defected from New Ford Kenya that was dissolved to join Jubilee to come back home and join Ford Kenya," he said.Wamunyinyi lashed out at Deputy President William Ruto for saying that Luhyas are begging for a share of the government but do no want to help form the next government. Ruto spoke at the weekend in Webuye West during a funds drive."We in opposition are fighting to make the next government and will not join Jubilee," he said."They have been telling our people who do not even have water to drink to swallow saliva as they eat meat which they are robbing from wananchi."Wangamati said, "We know Bungoma alone can register one million voters and we want to do that so that Wetang'ula may have enough strength to battle for the top seat."He said Ford Kenya will win most county posts in the election and urged aspirants to join the party.The two leaders spoke on Monday in Kanduyi after meeting party delegates from the constituency.
