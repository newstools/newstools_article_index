Former Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi has exonerated four former senior government officials from blame over Anglo Leasing contracts that cost the government more than Sh10 billion.Mudavadi, who appeared before an anti-corruption court on Wednesday as a witness, testified that based on the documentation provided to him, the four did nothing arbitrary.The four are former finance minister Chris Obure, now Kisii Senator, former postmaster general Francis Chahonyo, former finance secretary Samuel Bundotich and former PS Sammy Kyungu.They are facing charges of defrauding the government of the amount.When cross-examined by defense lawyers Kioko Kilukumi and Chacha Odera, Mudavadi told the court the documents showed laid down procedures were followed.He said the four did not make a personal decision in awarding the contracts as they were satisfied with the necessary information and documentation required for the same."Minister Obure at that time authorised payment after being satisfied with information he had sought from my ministry, and cannot therefore be said to have acted arbitrarily," he said.The former senior government officials have denied conspiring to defraud the government by awarding the Anglo Leasing contracts.Mudavadi denied playing a key role in a contract between the government and two US companies for the supply of internet services in 2002.He said he only signed letters to facilitate the award of the controversial contracts.Adding that he left office before the project was implemented, Mudavadi said that to the best of his knowledge, the latter was largely effected.It was his testimony that he never interacted with Spacenet and Mercantile Companies but he admitted signing letters seeking support from the Finance ministry.He said that this was after he received information that the Postal Corporation - a parastatal under his ministry - required new technology to improve its services.Chahonyo and Kyungu allegedly initiated the procurement in a network of operations executed between March and July 2002, for which Obure is said to have authorised payments that were allegedly made by Bundotich.Obure faces two counts of abuse of office and breach of trust by authorising the Ministry of Transport to directly procure VSAT equipment from Spacenet for the Postal Corporation of Kenya without following procurement procedures.Chahonyo and Kyungu are also facing charges of abuse of office and breach of trust. They allegedly initiated the procurement of VSAT equipment from the foreign companies without following procurement laws.
