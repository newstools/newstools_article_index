Ten-man AFC Leopards showed their resilient side yesterday as they twice came from behind to hold Ulinzi Stars to an entertaining 2-2 draw in a Sporptesa Premier League match at Nakuru s Afraha stadium.Twice Daniel Waweru had given Ulinzi the lead at the extreme ends of the first half but goals from Kepha Aswani and a stunner six minutes form time by substitute Mungai Kiongera ensured matters ended evens.In a barnstorming start to the match Biran Birgen tested Lucas Indeche with a snap shot before Aswani responded with a lighting quick counter that ended with Saruni James thwarting Simon Abuko.After Waweru had wasted a good set piece opportunity he got the chance to redeem himself in the seventh minute when he ghosted in at the far post to guide Samuel Onyango s cross past Indeche and the ball watching Jackon Saleh.ASwani then had two chances to test Saruni and brought Leopards level but he dithered on both occassion allowing first Geoffrey Kokoyo and then Mohammed Hassan to clear their lines. A minute to the break he got his 12th goal of the campaign as he prodded in a lose ball after Ulinzi had failed to deal with Yusuf Jumas free kick won after Omar Mbongi had fouled the speedy Abuko. The respite did not last long however, as Saleh brought Waweru down in the box and the attacker dusted himself up before dispatching the spot kick to give the soldiers a 2-1 halftime lead. Ulinzi sent on John Makwata for Samuel and the 12th goal striker was twice denied by Indeche from extending Ulinzi s lead. Aswani then limped off to be replaced by Alfred Wekesa but it was Kiongera who had replaced Bernard Mangoli in the 20th minute who had the last say scoring a scorcher past Saruni to give Leopards a deserved point.With four matches left to play Ulinzi have 38 points in fifth place ten behind league leaders Tusker who face a tough outing when they face Bandari.
