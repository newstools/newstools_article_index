Ugenya MP David Ochieng has said the three Cord co-principals are taking too much time to decide which of them will be the presidential candidate.He said Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang ula engage in unnecessary boardroom discussions. Raila, Kalonzo and Wetang ula are spending too much time, Ochieng said. He spoke on Tuesday during a morning talk show on Citizen TV. Ochieng praised Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho for deciding to launch vigorous campaigns to warn the co-principals that time is running out on them. Joho is right to inform them, he said. Ochieng dismissed claims Joho is strategising to deputise Raila if ODM decides to go it alone in the next elections. Joho is galvanising support at the Coast, before moving to hinterland for his future political ambitions, he said.
