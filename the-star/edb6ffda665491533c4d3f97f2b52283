Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa will release Uhuru's schedule.Taveta MP Naomi Shaban told the Star it is normal for them to meet Uhuru every time he is around.

A few weeks ago, Uhuru met 16 Coast MPs at State House "to discuss development". Their spokesperson, Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro said they talked about JP and the role the Coast leaders will play in the new party. We will join the Jubilee Party and by the time it will be launched we will be at the centre and we will take our rightful place, he said. Mung'aro will lead the rebels in welcoming Uhuru next week. The MP led the unsuccessful onslaught by Jubilee to wrest Kilifi county from Cord in the March 7 Malindi by-election. Mung'aro has been tasked with the responsibility to ensure the party becomes popular in all the six counties.
