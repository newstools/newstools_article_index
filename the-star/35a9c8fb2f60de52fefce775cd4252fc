Docubox, a Documentary Film Fund that supports intimate, character-driven storytelling and encourages new forms of ownership and authorship in East Africa, will hold an exclusive screening of a film titled For Kibera Screening, this March in Nairobi. The film revolves around a boy called Dallas, who lives in Kibera, the second largest informal settlement in Africa. He works as a radio personality and is known as the voice of Kibera. He s inundated with stories of injustice, and Dallas increasingly starts to wonder why it is that he s so poor. Kibera is a celebrity slum where more than 200 NGOs are active and many famous people have paid a visit. Nevertheless, rape and murder are business as usual, the streets are filthy and there are no sewers. The little river where Dallas played as a child has dried up and is full of trash. What use are the new apartment buildings (with parking spaces) to the residents of Kibera? quipped a statement. As a self-taught cameraman, Dallas sets out to find out why a neighborhood that has received so much help for so long is still in such a terrible state. He talks to ambassadors and donors and sees just how different their world is from his. With his handheld camera, he reveals the harsh reality of living in Kibera. The film will be screened on March 30 at the PAWA254's Mageuzi Theatre.
