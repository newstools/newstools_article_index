Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has urged rivals not to harass sitting leaders.He said it is unfortunate that MCAs always resort to passing impeachment motions against governors in case of misunderstandings.Mutua also criticised opposition chief Raila Odinga, whom he said disrepected President Uhuru Kenyatta during former Cabinet minister William ole Ntimama s funeral in Narok last Wednesday.Mutua visited Embu county to popularise his Maendeleo Chap Chap Movement on Saturday.He said rivals who harass sitting leaders disrupt their work.Mutua hailed the President for defending the government s development record and its policies at Ntimama s burial.He hit out at leaders who always confront their rivals and abandon their roles in pushing for development. Mutua spoke a few days after the Senate cleared Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua of any wrongdoing after MCAs passed a motion to remove him over alleged poor governance.He urged MCAs and other leaders to give governors a chance and work for the people who elected them. The Machakos governor said when governors are mistreated, it is the residents who suffer. They should be given a chance to implement their pre-election pledges without persecution, Mutua said.He said Kenya s peace is destabilised by lack of tangible development and poor leaders, which he said the Maendeleo Chap Chap Movement will address.Mutua said in developed countries there is peace because citizens are satisfied with development.He said that, however, in Kenya and most African countries, leaders exercise divisive, corrupt and confrontational politics, which stagnate development.Mutua urged residents to support his MCCM to advocate fast development in all parts of the country.He said he has initiated many development projects in Machakos, which have transformed it. Mutua mingled with people in the streets and took tea at a local restaurant in Embu market.He also bought a young boy open sandals because the pair he had on was worn out.The governor called for representation of the youth in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and other senior government appointments.
