Jared Ratemo, a courier in Nairobi, is the latest millionaire in town having walked away with the Sh19 million Mcheza Jackpot.Ratemo, who has run the delivery business with his partner since 2012, remained tight-lipped after winning the prize as he waited for a call from Mcheza to confirm his fortunes. Speaking during the press conference, the overjoyed 37-year-old father of two, said he had spread his luck to increase his chances of winning. On Sunday, I was left with 800 to play for the jackpot. I have some knowledge of how Spanish and Italian leagues play, but one of the games proved challenging. I placed two bets with Sh400 each one a draw and another with a home win. I wasn t sure I had won though, and even when the message came, I was still doubtful but excite. I went to bed quietly, waiting for my call in the morning, said Ratemo. I wish to invest in my wife and children, set up rental houses to keep the money coming and complete a house I am building in Kisii. This has indeed changed my life for the better, since I have been relying on loans and the humble income from my delivery contracts, he added.He also vowed to send some of the money to church in thanksgiving as well as repay loans from various savings and Credit Societies which have funded an ongoing construction back in his home village.
