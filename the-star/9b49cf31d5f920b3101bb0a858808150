MPs are right to guarantee people s right to join and seek nomination elsewhere if they are robbed their nomination by their party or merger.Already some people like governors Isaac Ruto and Peter Munya have expressed fear that their political competitors who are in the leadership of yet to be registered Jubilee Party will not give them the nomination. As a solution to their predicament, they have opted to move to other parties that they have confidence will not rob them of their nomination but give them a fair chance to win one.Even as President Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto are assuring people that competition for JP nominations will be democratic, free and fair, parties volunteering to join JP merger do not enjoy equal chance to join the merger while some parties are being denied invitation to join JP merely because interim leaders of the merger fear competition from the leaders of those parties.It follows logic that if interim leadership of JP will exclude parties whose leaders they fear or dislike, they will also undermine nomination of leaders they fear and dislike because they threaten to challenge their positions in party leadership or because they are going to vie for the same electoral seats.Because leaders of mergers do not have integrity enough to guarantee the rights of persons who dissolve their parties to join mergers or guarantee that under no circumstances will anybody be robbed nominations they have won, mergers are best formed after elections and without dissolution and people who are robbed their nominations in a party or merger will have the right to seek nomination elsewhere.The right of individuals and few people to seek nomination elsewhere after have been robbed nomination might sound peripheral but they are just as important as those of majorities who are satisfied with status quo or independent candidates who do not need to go through a nomination process.People who know that only democracy can protect their freedom and there can be no democracy without rights of individuals and minorities, must protect rights of individuals to change parties when other parties rob them of nominations and fail to give them justice and protect their rights.By moving against rights of individuals to seek nomination for a primary election where the competition should be absolutely free, Jubilee and Cord coalitions have now proved that they cannot be trusted to protect democracy and people s rights or even free and fair elections.Just as Kanu championed the struggle for independence but later killed people s confidence to safeguard their freedom by killing democracy and people s rights in the name of unity, major parties now want to kill the same rights in the name of unity that has been used in many other places to kill democracy and rule of law.The former President of Tanzania Julius Nyerere argued strongly and convincingly that in a true democracy there should be independent candidates to correct majority leaders when they are wrong and protect minority leaders when they are right. Nyerere admitted that he and his majority party had been wrong in denying nomination to a candidate who was better and more popular than the candidate whom the ruling party was imposing on the people. When the elections were finally done, Nyerere and his party badly lost to the independent candidate who actually belonged to their own party.Already this country has suffered a lot from robbery of nomination to good candidates and imposition of wrong candidates upon people by parties, presidential candidates, clan and ethnic leaders. The imposed candidates go on to become wrong leaders of people for the next five years at great cost to people and country.Fortunately, there have been many instances when right candidates who have been wrongly denied nomination have gone ahead to seek nomination from other parties with whose nominations they have vied, won election and have become good leaders of their voters and country.While we have argued that mergers can enhance national unity by bringing more people together, they cannot do so by violating rights of individuals and minorities. Democracy and freedom can never be sacrificed upon the altar of unity and leaders interests.
