The disbandment of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya has generated mixed reactions among sports stakeholders in Rift Valley,the bedrock of Kenyan athletics talent.Cabinet Secretary for Sport Hassan Wario announced the disbandment on Thursday following the organisational mess that befell Team Kenya during the just conclude Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Former Olympic 1,500m gold medallist Noah Ngeny said the move is long overdue owing to the mishandling of Team Kenya.Ngeny said the NOCK committee had failed to seal the loopholes in their midst hence the incessant problems witnessed in each Olympic year. The way NOCK handled the team during these Games in Rio was very poor. Imagine the humiliation Kenya was subjected to over the well documented grievances.Despite the sideshows, athletes persevered and won Kenya medals, Ngeny said.Initially athletes had complained of lack of enough kit for the games supplied by Nike to Nock as well as poor travel arrangements with some athletes finding their air tickets missing among other issues.Athletics Kenya Central Rift branch chairman Abraham Mutai said Nock had disregarded pertinent issues about Team Kenya by failing to make athletes needs the priority.According to Mutai the disbandment will create a platform for a proper constitution of the Olympics committee to be put in place.Moses Tanui termed the action as good news .He alleged Nock had been handled like a personal property. I think no one had a say in the management of the committee and it is good news to us. Athletes have suffered and this is the era we want where athletes are given a priority, He said.They called on the Cabinet Secrretary to set up an interim committee to oversee the operations of the committee.Athletics Kenya had also complained of being sidelined by Nock despite being among its top achieving affiliates.But Benjamin Letting one of the sports stakeholders in North Rift differed saying Nock is not a government entity and only IOC had a say over its fate. I am shocked. Which law did the minister use tio make that kind of move? This amount to government interference in the operations of Nock.
