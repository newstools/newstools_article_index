Kiambu county will safeguard agriculture amidst the growth in real estate development, which has reduced farmland, Governor William Kabogo has said.He said his government is aware of the growing number of private real estate developers in Kiambu. There are efforts, through the Lands department, to develop policies that will guide land use, Kabogo said yesterday.He said the Kiambu administration has called for the adoption of new farming methods suitable for urban and peri-urban areas. The Agriculture department has come up with appropriate technologies, include greenhouse farming, hydroponics, aquaponics and drip irrigation, the governor said.Youth take up farmingDue to its proximity to Nairobi, the county has experienced a surge in mega developments, both commercial and residential. They include the 2,500-acre Tatu City industrial park.The governor said new technologies in farming have attracted more youth to the business once seen as an affair for old people. The new technologies, like greenhouse, fish farming and rabbit breeding, have compelled more youth to venture into the industry, he said.Kabogo said the county has set up an affordable credit fund County Biashara Fund to encourage youth into farming.He said the county government is working on spearheading food security by encouraging farmers to concentrate on cash crops, such as tea and coffee, cowpeas and other vegetables.Among other agricultural ventures Kiambu county has launched include irrigation projects to benefit about 2,000 households.The county aims to ensure farmers access subsidised fertiliser to reduce the cost of inputs.
