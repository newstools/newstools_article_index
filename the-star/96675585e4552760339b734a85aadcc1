Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi has urged residents to maintain good hygiene and sanitation to curb diseases and preserve water sources. Speaking to the press in Wajir town, he said its growth and increasing demand for water has put a strain on the available sources. There is need to use water sparingly as the county works out modalities for a project to be sponsored by the World Bank to improve water access, Abdullahi said. He said the World Bank project will take at least two years. I therefore urge you to use the little water we have sparingly and also ensure that our town remains tidy, Abdullahi said.The governor urged voters and aspirants to avoid peddling hate during electioneering. Elections will come and go but we shall remain as brothers and sisters, so we must maintain good relations always, Abdullahi said.
