The last three Presidents in Kenya are responsible for the increase in capital offences, Busia residents have said.They presented their views before the Power of Mercy Advisory Committee at Busia Agricultural Training College on Monday.The residents said failure to sign the death warrant since 1987 has encouraged capital offences. Once the courts of law have convicted capital offenders to death, why should the President not sign the death warrant? a resident asked. They said inmates facing life sentences should remain in prison until they die.Committee vice chairperson Regina Boisabi said there have been more than 3,000 inmates on Death Row since 1987. She said Busia stakeholders want capital offenders hanged and the law on capital offences strengthened.The residents want rapists, terrorists and economic crime perpetrators on the list of capital offenders.Busia county commissioner Mongo Chimwaga said capital offenders should not be released on bond, as they interfere with investigations, tamper with evidence and threaten witnesses.Some members of the judiciary, provincial administration and church leaders want the death sentence abolished and replaced with life imprisonment.
