Kenya s largest brewer EABL now wants a contempt case filed against its directors by its largest distributor Bia Tosha dismissed on grounds that it lacks merit.In response to a suit filed by Bia Tosha, the brewer says the contempt proceedings before court have been filed in bad faith with the intention of harassing its directors.Bia Tosha is asking the court to penalise EABL directors Drew Cowan and Jane Karuku, together with Kenya Breweries sales director Andrew Kilonzo for disobeying the court. The distributor, in its suit papers claims that EABL directors disobeyed the orders of the court requiring them to continue supplying it with alcohol products. The firm said EABL's refusal to supply it with products despite having been ordered to do so by the court amounts to contempt of court and is intended to cripple Bia Tosha's business. In a replying affidavit, EABL denies these claims saying an agreement between the two had already lapsed on June 3 when the alleged disobedience occurred. The agreement between us and Bia Tosha expired as matter of fact on the lapse of the two months period time, neither party needed to do anything to make the agreement lapse, it automatically lapsed and the same was not renewed, says EABL legal director Nadida Rowlands in the affidavit.According to the legal director, the suit is meant to intimidate and coerce EABL into supplying Bia Tosha with products and giving it exclusive rights to certain routes without a contract.The brewer argued that the court order being relied on by the distributor did not make any reference to the said agreement and as such the distributor cannot use it to assert its rights in respect of the expired contract.Further, EABL says the distributor did not place any order for the brewer's products between August 3 and August 11, hence there were no products to be supplied. Throughout the proceedings the petitioner (Bia Tosha ) has incessantly harassed, threatened EABL using highly bad language and even threatened to arrange for the arrest and incarceration of the directors. " adds Rowlands.The court had earlier given an order for Bia Tosha to continue distributing products in Namanga, Bissil, Kajiado, Kitengela, Athi River, Industrial Area, South B, Nairobi West, Kenyatta, Lang ata, Rongai, Kiserian, Magadi, Upper Hill, Ngong Road, Hurlingham, Kawangware, Satellite, Dagoretti pending hearing of the case. Bia Tosha wants the brewer's directors sent to civil jail for a period of six months or fined Sh30 million if found guilty. When the matter came up in court yesterday before justice Joseph Onguto for hearing, Bia Tosha informed court that it had just been served with the response and it required more time to put in its rejoinder.The judge directed the file to be placed before the court on October 10.
