A Mombasa court will rule today whether to grant bail to Muslim cleric Aboud Rogo s widow Haniya Sagar and three girls accused of involvement in an attack on a police station.Sagar, Luul Ali, her sister Nasteho Ali and Zamzam Abdullahi are accused of conspiring to commit a felony on September 11 at the Central police station in Mombasa.They allegedly committed the offence alongside slain terror suspects Tasmin Farah, Ramla Abdirahman and Maimuna Abdirahman. Police said one stabbed an officer and they had a petrol bomb. The accused also face charges of failing to disclose information which could have prevented a terror attack.They are further accused of failing to disclose information related to the slain terror terrorists, which could have secured prosecution of three other people being investigated for terror-related activities. Senior principal magistrate Diana Mochache said she will deliver her ruling after the prosecution and defence teams present their submissions.Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alex Muteti and counsel Daniel Wamotsa said they have a strong case why the accused should remain in custody. Muteti said police are still investigating and releasing the four would prejudice investigations.
