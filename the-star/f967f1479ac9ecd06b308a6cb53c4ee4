Poor eating habits are likely to push more Kenyans to be either overweight or obese.Head of Nutrition and Dietetics Unit in the Ministry of Health Gladys Mugambi yesterday said excise duty on soft drinks and attitude change will work."The problem is likely to increase as we become urbanized,"she told the star on phone.Mugambi said the problem is being felt in some regions in Nairobi and Central each with prevalence of 47 percent.WHO said fiscal policies that lead to at least a 20 percent increase in the retail price of sugary drinks would result in proportional reductions in consumption of such products.The global body wants more taxes imposed on sugary drinks to lower consumption and reduce obesity and type two diabetes.Mugambi said Kenyans have avoided eating traditional foods,a move that has made matters worse."Companies should also label their products for Kenyans to know what they are eating,"she said adding that processed food and soft drinks are a major source of problem.Head of Health Promotion Unit at Ministry of Health Sam Mahugu echoed her sentiments saying the ministry is set to scale up awareness campaigns.A survey by the government last years shows that 27 percent of Kenyans are either overweight or obese with the percentage being significantly higher in women (38.5 percent) than men (17.5 percent).According to the Stepwise survey, NCDs in the country contribute to over 50 percent of inpatient admissions and 40percent of Hospitalmortality causing substantial financial burden and pushing individuals, households and communities into poverty as well as slowing down economic progress of the country.According to the ministry,the annual incidence of cancer is close to 37,000 new cases with an annual mortality of over 28,000 making cancer the third leading cause of death after infectious diseases and cardiovascular conditions.The survey says 19.3 percent of Kenyans currently drink alcohol with 13 percent of these consuming alcohol on a daily basis. Consumption of free sugars, including products like sugary drinks, is a major factor in the global increase of people suffering from obesity and diabetes, director of WHO s department for the Prevention of NCDs Douglas Bettcher said.WHO estimates that NCDs will cause 73 percent of global deaths and 60percent of the burden of disease by 2020.Sixteen million of NCD deaths occur before the age of 70 with 82 percent of these "premature" deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or 17.5 million people annually, followed by cancers (8.2 million), respiratory diseases (4 million), and diabetes (1.5 million).These four groups of diseases account for 82 percent of all NCD deaths with tobacco use, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets all increase the risk of dying from an NCD significantly.
