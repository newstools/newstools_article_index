Early season title hopefuls Muhoroni Youth and Mathare United endured a goal-less duel yesterday as SportPesa Premier League action resumed yesterday afternoon.After their hopes of contesting for the top flight Championship were curtailed by different reasons, both sides came into the match with modest ambitions.However, Mathare still had mathematical chances of winning the league title.In what was Tom Juma s first match since he was elevated as Muhoroni head coach, the home side had the better of the opening chances with Moses Arita and Yusuf Mohammed s efforts demanding saves from Mathare custodian Robert Mboya. Chances were at a premium in both halves.Midway through the second half, Muhoroni brought on Calvin Omanga and Lwamba Bebeto in search of an elusive winner to no good effect. While Muhoroni remained rooted in ninth after the stalemate, the point was enough to move Mathare fourth above Chemelil Sugar with both sides on 39 points.Meanwhile Betway Kenya in partnership with Mathare will host trials for aspiring footballers at Goan Institute football grounds on Saturday (8am).As part of Betway s inaugural talent search launched last month, 1,600 aspiring footballers aged between 18 and 24 from across the country have been selected to participate.During the trials, their skills will be tested under the watchful eyes of local and international scouts as they compete for a place in the final 16 (two goalkeepers and 14 infield players) who will attend a specialised football training camp next month. The camp will be a three-day venture that will be undertaken in conjunction with United Kingdom s West Ham United and Mathare United Betway s newly sponsored partner in Kenya.From this final group of 16, one lucky footballer will win the grand prize United Kingdom for a West Ham Experience which will include training, sightseeing, a live match and player meet and greets.The Betway Mathare partnership reportedly received the green-light from the Kenyan Premier League governing council as it was deemed to not be in breach of the existing sponsorship agreements between the top flight league and its title sponsor.
