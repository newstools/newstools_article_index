Others from the area include former Migori speaker Gordon Ogolla, who was removed by MCAs last October, Knut deputy secretary general Charles Katege and Eng Ogolla Ogolla.On Thursday, Awuonda told the Star on the phone his bid is still on the table but he is still a civil servant. Former Mathare MP Ochieng Mbeo from Awendo constituency has also declared interest in the seat. Last election I vied for the post on an ODM ticket, but I stepped down after the nominations. This time round I will concentrate my campaigns to retain the seat, Mbeo said. They have accused Senator Wilfred Machage of failing to play his oversight role.
