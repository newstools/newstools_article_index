Auditor General Edward Ouko has put MPs on the spot over the unlawful spending of CDF money, as Treasury plans to release Sh25 billion to the 290 constituencies in two months.Audit reports for some constituencies tabled in the National Assembly last week reveal irregularities in procurement, poorly done CDF projects and failure by CDF committees to involve the public in projects.National Assembly CDF committee chairman Moses Lessonet said Treasury has already released Sh8 billion to the constituencies, out of Sh25 billion allowed by the court for 2016-17.Sh35BN for cdfCDF was allocated Sh35 billion this year, but the High Court barred Treasury from disbursing beyond Sh25 billion to constituencies until the new CDF la w is streamlined. Treasury has shown willingness and commitment to disburse Sh25 billion before December. Every constituency will receive Sh81 million as an equal share under the new CDF law, Lessonet said.The audit reports for the year ended June 2015 tabled by majority leader Aden Duale on Tuesday during a special sitting bear Ouko s adverse recommendations. They show taxpayers may not get value for millions of shillings pumped into numerous projects in their constituencies.The reports cite poor budgeting as the main cause of either overspending of public money or under-funding the projects, leading to delayed implementation and residents denied access to services.Ouko says his officers are not given reasons behind CDF committees delaying projects through under-funding, despite the CDF board approving and releasing funds for timely implementation.
