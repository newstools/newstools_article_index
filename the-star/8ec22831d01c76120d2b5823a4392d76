One of Kenya s largest elephant has been fitted with a GPS tracking collar to allow Kenya Wildlife Service and their non-governmental partners to prevent him from raiding the farms surrounding Amboseli National Park.Known as Tim, the iconic bull elephant has not only gained international fame on account of his tusks, but also local notoriety because of his habit of entering farms in the Kimana area to feed to crops. The tracking collar gives rangers on the ground the ability to track the tusker s movements and deploy into farmland areas when he approaches and chase him from the area using a variety of deterrents.Read: Experts fit jumbos with GPS to beat poachers Read: Five jumbos wearing tracking devices cross SGR line in Voi KWS director general Kitili Mbathi, who participated in the exercise on Saturday last week, said the service is committed to exploring effective methods to keep communities safe while securing all of our elephants.The 47 year-old bull has been monitored by the Amboseli Trust for Elephants since he was born in December 1969 to a cow named Trista. His grandmother was the matriarch Teresia, leader of Amboseli s TD family. After the operation to fit his tracking collar, Tim began walking towards the Trust s research centre, and spent a morning resting there."It will be wonderful to see his life in even finer detail now that his every move is being followed," said Cynthia Moss, Founder of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants. The tracking system developed and donated by Save the Elephants will allow rangers from KWS and Big Life to monitor his movements using mobile devices and a VHF tracking antenna. When Tim crosses a virtual line near farmland, an alert will also be sent to warn them to prepare for his arrival.The high-tech GPS tracking collar was made by Kenyan firm Savannah Tracking."Tim s new collar should give rangers a crucial advantage in preventing conflict between farmers and this iconic elephant, while also helping us to understand how to plan landscapes to keep our two species apart," said Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants.KWS and Big Life rangers will be on call 24 hours a day to respond.

Now with a collar that shows us his location at any time, our problem animal control teams will be able to be one step of ahead of him and keep him away from farms. Another great example of technology enabling conservation," said Big Life Director Richard Bonham.WildlifeDirect raised the funds that will to support the KWS and Big Life Foundation ground teams."To collar a majestic wild animal so that he can live out his life in peace and safety is an unnatural act. To build fences where farms have been allowed to encroach on historic migration paths in order to protect the lives of both settlers and animals - those, too, are unnatural acts. But if that's what it takes to protect our wildlife, I support and encourage all of it," said WildlifeDirect s Board Director Scott Asen.More on this: KWS to fit more satellite collars on Amboseli jumbos
