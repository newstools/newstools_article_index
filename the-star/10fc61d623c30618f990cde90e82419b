City Hall has stopped the salaries of more than 200 striking doctors and has given them until next Monday to return to work or their jobs be declared vacant.County secretary Robert Ayisi said the doctors are engaging in an illegal strike because the Employment and Labour Relations Court suspended it on Friday last week.The doctors downed their tools on September 11, demanding six months salary. They also protested against delayed promotions and the county s failure to remit their NHIF deductions since January.The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists' Union said all members in Nairobi have not been paid for six months, but Ayisi said only 37 doctors of the 53 who were posted by the Ministry of Health have not received their salaries."We absorbed 53 doctors at the beginning of the year but up to now, only 16 have picked their appointment letters. The remaining 37 have not picked theirs and we could not put them on the payroll until they pick them," he said.Ayisi said other doctors are on payroll and have received their salaries."If you are on our payroll and you are engaging on this strike you have until the end of the day to return to work. If you fail, then we will ask the Public Service Board to declare the jobs vacant and start recruitment," he said.But KMPDU secretary general Ouma Oluga refuted Ayisi's sentiments that 37 doctors have not collected their employment letters."This county is not serious with us. The issuance of appointment letters was part of the demands in the strike notice we gave them. The 16 doctors they claim have collected the letters are people who have their godfathers and only got their letters when we were already on strike," he said.In an agreement letter between the union and the county secretary dated September 9 and seen by the Star, the parties agreed that all the remaining 36 doctors would be included in the September payroll.On Monday, the assembly Health Committee said it will not allow City Hall to replace the medics.Chairman Manoah Mboku said the doctors are within their rights to demand the pay and accused the county of frustrating its workers. We have already told the county not to sack them... They [doctors] are asking for allowances, promotions and a better working environment, he said.
