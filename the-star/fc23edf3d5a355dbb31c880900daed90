Nine ODM rebels yesterday blamed their leader Raila Odinga for mismanaging the party, as they appeared before a disciplinary committee . They said Raila is the root cause of ODM s problems, which include undemocratic party nominations marred by violence.The lawmakers were represented by lawyer Kioko Kilukumi. They said their associating with the government and Jubilee Party does not mean they have defected to the Jubilee Party. They said the Constitution allows them to associate with anyone. They told the five-member committee, chaired by Fred Athuok, that ODM is only trying to intimidate them with disciplinary action threats. They said they have not written to the party notifying it of defection.The panel questioned Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani and his Kwale counterpart Salim Mvurya, Kisii Deputy Governor Joash Maangi and MPs Steven Kariuki (Mathare), Cyprian Kubai (Igembe Central), Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town West), John Waluke (Sirisia), Isaac Mwaura (nominated) and Zainabu Chidzuga (Kwale woman representative).Four summed MPs Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East), Gideon Mung aro (Kilifi North), James Rege (Karachuonyo), and Ababu Namwamba (Budalang i) did not show up. Kilukumi said they presented written submissions. It is a criminal offence for any person, including ODM to suppress or attempt to suppress my lawful political activity, Waluke s submission reads.He said the political parties Code of Conduct calls for the resolution of differences through constructive dialogue. Waluke said it also calls for national unity. My attendance at the launch of Jubilee Party must be seen through that prism, he said. Waluke accused Raila of poor leadership by not supporting him in organising ODM functions in Bungoma county and by allowing Cord co-principal Moses Wetang ula to frustrate his efforts to popularise the party in the region .
