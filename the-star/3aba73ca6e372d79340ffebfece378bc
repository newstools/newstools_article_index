Narc-Kenya leader Martha Karua has said she will make a second stab at the presidency, but does not rule out the possibility of joining Cord.She said when election time comes, her party will make strategic decisions to win seats. Falling is normal but I am still energetic to lead Kenyans, Karua said. The strategic decisions have been viewed as a formation of an alliance similar to Narc, which ended Kanu s four-decade rule and brought President Mwai Kibaki to power in 2002.Karua said her party manifesto is almost similar to that of Wiper, an affiliate of Cord. She said she might join hands with them to implement it.Karua said Wiper agitates for gender equality in elections, nominations and appointments. A party that will not give women an opportunity should not be voted for, she said. Karua said Jubilee promised to ensure gender equality but has failed.Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar said Cord wants Karua, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Kanu chairman Gideon Moi and Meru Governor Peter Munya to join the opposition and fight Jubilee.The two spoke on Saturday during a public lecture on Mobilisation without Emancipation: Women and Politics in Kenya at the Renaissance Centre in Mombasa, where Karua was the key speaker.The former Justice minister supported Cord leader Raila Odinga s call to have the rejected two-thirds gender rule Bill passed. She said despite Cord MPs failing to pass it, Raila made an extra effort to have it passed.She said President Uhuru Kenyatta did not mobilise Jubilee legislators, despite having powers to influence their decision. Karua said Uhuru does not want women to get more seats, but Raila does.She said she will join forces with politicians who treat women fairly. Karua said she wants to bring change and send home the Jubilee government, which she referred to as corrupt.
