Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday defended co-principals Moses Wetang ula and Kalonzo Musyoka over their remarks on his presidential bid.He said the statements by the two are part of their plan to strengthen their parties. We agreed sometime back that each Cord affiliate should go out and market itself. That s what they are doing. We are still united and we will come back at the right time to pick a presidential candidate, Raila said. Kalonzo said at the weekend in Tononoka, Mombasa, he is the best candidate. Wetang ula wants the former Prime Minister to endorse him as Cord s presidential flagbearer. We re in the chase for the top seat, and each party has its game plan to strengthen itself, Raila said. He said each party is out to strengthen itself and consolidate its support.Raila (pictured) said the coalition will decide on how to pick a presidential candidate before the year ends. We all have a common agenda to win the next elections so the country can be run effectively and competently. We all want to stop corruption and promote unity in Cord, he said.ODM chairman John Mbadi assured Cord supporters the three co-principals will work together to win the next elections. Wiper says Kalonzo supported former President Mwai Kibaki in 2007 and Raila 2013 so we should support him. Wetang ula says he is the best candidate. ODM says Raila has sacrificed a lot for this country and is the best candidate. That s good for democracy. In the end, we ll support whoever emerges tops in the nomination, he said.
