The Court of Appeal yesterday stopped the prosecution of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua over corruption allegations.Judges Erastus Githinji, GBM Kariuki and Kantai ole Sankale stopped Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission from going on with the case until an application before them is determined. Orders issued by the honourable judge Isaac Lenaola allowing the DPP to commence a criminal case against Mutua are stayed until the case is concluded, they said.Mutua s lawyer Wilfred Nyamu told the judges the DPP and the EACC would arrest his client following Lenaola s order.Mutua faces charges of abuse of office in procurement of 14 vehicles for the county s executive committee members.He was to be charged in February 2015 over the alleged irregular purchases, but the case at the magistrate s court stalled after he moved to the High Court.
