The move was undertaken after we received complaints from customers, he said on Friday.The manager warned shopkeepers and industries against stocking items which do not meet standards.He said the plastic pipes were undersized while the roofing sheets had minimal zinc coating and did not meet labeling requirements.Nyakiamo noted labeling must be in eligible ink, not removable stickers.
