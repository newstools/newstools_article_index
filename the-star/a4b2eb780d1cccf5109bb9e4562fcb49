There was drama in Naivasha after fishermen clashed with Kenya Wildlife Service rangers whom they accused of stealing their fish and nets.During the incident at Karagita, the fishermen confiscated a boat used by the rangers and the allegedly stolen fish accusing the officers of overstepping their mandate.At one time, the officers had to cock their guns when the more than 100 fishermen and traders cornered them.The group said that the officers have been frustrating them for the last one month.Trouble started after the rangers, using their patrol boat, confiscated over thirty nets as well as the fishermen's catch for the previous night.David Kilo, chairman Lake Naivasha boat owners association, said the mandate to inspect nets and boats rests with the fisheries officers and not KWS.Read: Lake Naivasha to be closed for clean-up, restockingAlso read: Lake Naivasha fishermen raise money for fingerlings as stocks dwindleHe claimed that the trio had on various occasions took away nets and fishes, only to be spotted selling the seizure in the nearby Naivasha town."They have been venturing into the lake every night and either stealing from the fishermen nets or confiscating their equipment," he said.Kilo asked KWS bosses to rein in on the officers adding that they will not release the seized boat until disciplinary action is taken."We are holding their patrol boat which they have been using to oppress us and steal our fish. We shall release it once action is taken against the errant officers," he said.Meanwhile, the government has lifted the three-day fishing ban imposed in Lake Naivasha after a massive clean-up to weed out illegal fishing gear.Fisheries officer Nicholas Kagundu said the lake will be restocked this week with more than 100,000 fingerlings.Kagundu said fishermen will contribute 5,000 fingerlings, and the rest will be supplied by stakeholders and the county government."I have received complaints from the fishermen and we are liaising with our KWS counterparts so that we can amiably resolve the issue," he said on the KWS, fishermen row.
