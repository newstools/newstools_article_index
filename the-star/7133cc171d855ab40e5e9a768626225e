She is likely to be a prosecution witness," Ondimu said in court.Shiroya was being probed together with secretary general Francis Kinyili Paul, First vice-chairman Pius Ochieng' and executive officer Stephen arap Soi.The group was booked over offences relating to abuse of office, neglect of duty and theft of kits meant for team in the Rio Olympic games held in August.Read: Sports CS Wario disbands NOCK, tasks Sports Kenya to probe Rio messRead: NOCK eight-member interim committee named The Nock officials were arrested following pressure from the public over the manner in which the international games were managed. While Shoroya s file is in the final steps of being closed, Ondimu told court that investigators were yet to complete their work in the cases against Soi, Kinyiri and Ochieng'.The lawyer said investigators required one week to complete the probe against the officials.He accused Soi - who was the Head of Mission of Team Kenya to Rio 2016 - of failing to cooperate with investigators hence the delay."He is withholding information since he has failed to produce documents that are vital to this investigation," Ondimu said."I have accepted the application from the prosecution for an extension of one week since the case is of public interest. The three suspects will continue to be reporting at the CID headquarters as earlier directed (twice weekly). Earlier orders and conditions given by the court will remain in force until further directions," the magistrate said.Also read: State House rejects NOCK claim of Rio rooms for Uhuru
