How many times do you stare at models in the magazines and wish you could look as flawless as them? Many times right? Well, local beauty consultant and digital strategist Kangai Mwiti officially launched the monthly Makeup Technique Masterclass on Saturday. Held at The Methodist Guest House in Lavington, the Cover Up Masterclass focused on foundation application techniques, covering seven areas including skin types and conditions, skin care systems, priming, colour correcting, skin undertones, foundation matching and application and foundation setting. The class included a practical session, where participants practiced what they learned during the first hour, under Kangai's personal direction. They all walked away with a Certificate of Attendance and a promise to sign up for the October masterclass.Mwiti currently provides makeup services to brides and advertisers among others as well as training upcoming makeup artists. Her YouTube channel is very popular, and she uses the site to teach African women how to apply makeup correctly. Her social media presence spans almost all relevant websites under the name BellesaAfrica.
