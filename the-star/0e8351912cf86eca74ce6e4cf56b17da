Nairobi speaker Alex ole Magelo has summoned Governor Evans Kidero to answer questions raised in the impeachment motion against him.In a letter on Wednesday, Magelo asked the governor to appear either in person or through his lawyers to answer to the allegations raised by Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang wara, as grounds for the move to impeach him. The assembly invites you to appear before a sitting of the county assembly at the assembly chambers on Tuesday, October 11, at 2.30pm.You will be afforded an opportunity to defend yourself against the allegations contained in the notice of motion, he said.Nyang wara tabled the motion on Tuesday, setting the stage for full debate beginning next Tuesday and lasting for three days.In his motion, Nyang wara said county debts have risen to unmanageable levels , since Kidero took over .He said the debt has increased from Sh12 billion in 2013 to Sh42 billion. Nyang wara says this has delayed and stalled important projects and programmes.. (Some of the debts) were not disclosed in the debts management strategy paper 2014-15, 2015-16 and the current fiscal year, the motion says.He also said the governor has consistently violated procurement and finance laws.Meanwhile, assembly clerk Jacob Ngwele yesterday appeared before the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to explain MCAs conduct on two occasions when the impeachment motion was being tabled last Thursday and then on Tuesday this week.Ngwele was questioned for more than three hours.He presented CCTV footage and video clips of the violence. They (detectives) were collecting evidence from the serjeant-at-arms on what happened. They were more keen on Chapter Six (integrity) and the Code of Ethics that every member signed, he said.Magelo is expected to appear before the investigators today.
