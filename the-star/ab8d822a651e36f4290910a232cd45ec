Do not elect leaders who are glorified by the media, nominated Senator Emma Mbura has urged residents. She said some Coast leaders are creations of the media and have nothing to offer residents.Mbura spoke on Thursday at Rabai constituency during a meet-the-people tour. Do not let the media or the establishment make you pick from the people they choose. Instead, choose a visionary and transformative leader who identifies with the people on the ground and is result-oriented, she said.Mbura will run for the Rabai parliamentary seat on the Jubilee Party ticket against MP William Kamoti of ODM. Another hopeful is LPK s Esther Kondo.
