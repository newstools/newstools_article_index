President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday called for additional market-led reforms to further lower the cost of borrowing in a sustainable way.He spoke as banks began complying with the law controlling interest on loans and term deposit.Capping interest on loans at 14.5 per cent and putting a minimum interest on deposits at 7.35 per cent, he said, is not enough to promote national savings and boost investments to targeted levels under the Vision 2030.National savings and investments have stagnated at about 15 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (national wealth), about half of the 30 per cent target under the country&#39;s long-term development blueprint.&ldquo;Kenya is at a turning point, and the banking sector has a critical role in supporting the economic transformation,&rdquo; the president said. &ldquo;I urge commercial banks to be more innovative and to work with the Central Bank of Kenya as well as other arms of government such as Lands (department) and others to ensure that we give Kenyans access to affordable credit.&rdquo;Kenya Bankers Association has said factors that kept the cost of credit high have not been solved by the Banking (Amendment) Act 2016, which became operational yesterday following its gazettement on August 31.They include high operational costs for lenders, costly dispute resolution mechanism, yet to be completed digitization of the land registry and Credit Reference mechanism, which is still under development, KBA chief executive Habil Olaka said.&ldquo;The banking sector will see quite a bit of innovation coming up in terms of products,&rdquo; he said on August 25 about the post-interest caps era. &ldquo;With the law coming into place, there may be no more motivation coming in that area (loans) especially if you cannot get a return on the risk that you give.&rdquo;The CBK, while directing banks to apply the 10.5 per cent Central Bank Rate as base in pricing loans, said it will implement reforms to enhance the cost of credit, disclosures and strengthen the credit information sharing mechanism.Uhuru spoke when the CBK marked its 50th anniversary by unveiling a museum of past coins and notes at the National Museums of Kenya.&ldquo;The CBK is repositioning itself for the next 50 years, and our aspiration is to be a world-class modern central bank, reflected in our processes, systems and our staff,&rdquo; CBK governor Patrick Njoroge said. &ldquo;CBK will continue to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision, with a view to supporting the continued safety, soundness and growth of the banking sector.&quot;The Vision 2030 seeks to promote a sound, safe and inclusive financial system to make Nairobi a regional financial services hub.
