The Nairobi assembly will punish city MCAs who fought on Thursday afternoon over Governor Evans Kidero's possible impeachment.Speaker Alex Magelo condemned the third case of violence in the assembly, saying the ward representatives disrespected Nairobi residents."It is a shameful, disgraceful and archaic act," he told the Star by phone on Friday."It is important that action is taken because equipment was destroyed. MCAs should note that they agreed to the leadership and integrity act in chapter six of the constitution."Magelo said Dandora Phase 4 MCA Dan Oria will be punished for starting the brawl and pelting deputy speaker Ken Ngondi with a bottle of water.Oria rose and grabbed the paper containing the motion from Viwandani MCA Samwel Nyang'wara before punching him.Nyang'wara threw the punch back at Oria who is said to have been drunk at the time.More on this: [VIDEO] Nairobi MCAs throw punches as Kidero impeachment motion tabledMagelo said Nyang'wara had a right to table any motion and that the action is legal.He said it was wrong for some MCAs to say he must be consulted before a motion is tabled, as this applies to the office of the speaker, not an individual.Karura MCA Kamau Thuo also condemned the violence and asked the speaker to punish the culprits.More than 56 Cord and Jubilee MCAs signed the petition to remove the city boss from office.It will take two thirds of the 127 members of the county assembly to remove the Governor from office.Nyang wara, who joined Jubilee, said Kidero has violated the constitution since we joined the assembly and failed to implement the Ward Development Fund. We have been passing budgets, but have not seen anything happening in our wards. There are no tangible projects, he said.But the Controller of Budget has insisted that the fund is unconstitutional.
