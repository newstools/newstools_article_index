Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria (pictured) has criticised opposition leader Raila Odinga s supporters, calling them cows.In a post on his official Facebook account, Kuria accused them of being behind a fake blog with quotes attributed to him about Deputy President William Ruto.He said the blog will not deter Ruto from becoming President in 2022. You Cord idiots, wake up to this reality. Raila will never be President of Kenya, he said. On the other hand, in five years and 10 months, [DP William] Ruto will be the fifth President of Kenya. He continued: If you don t like this go and take a nap on the water hyacinth in Lake Victoria. Mukagimara ri ngombe ichi? This loosely translates to: When will you grow up, you cows? The first-term MP has been on the spotlight for making defamatory remarks in public gatherings.
