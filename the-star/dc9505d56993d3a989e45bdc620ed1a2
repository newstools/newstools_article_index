The four children - one girl and three boys - are appealing for help after being abandoned by their parents.The girl, 5, has a swollen leg and is unable to walk after she fell from a tree one month ago while plucking wild fruits.Neighbour Emmanuel Kasiway on Friday said that their parents had a domestic conflict a week earlier and their mother decided to escape with one baby who was aged seven months. The mother decided to run away since they always quarreled with her husband over lack of food to feed the children, he said.Kasiway said the father was left to take care of the children but he has failed to attend to them since he is a drunkard.
