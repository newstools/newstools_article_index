The Nyamira assembly is satisfied with the county government s implementation of projects and programmes, speaker Joash Nyamoko has said. I can give the executive 70 per cent. Despite some challenges, they are on course, he told the Star on Tuesday.Nyamoko spoke after a three-day meeting at a Kisumu hotel. This meeting was very necessary because we have hit the homestretch and we did not want to be distracted by the upcoming campaigns, he said. We were appraised of the implementation of projects and we are pleased with the progress. We don t want a situation where projects are abandoned after five years. Nyamoko said perceived corruption, inexperience and political intrigues slowed implementation of some projects.
