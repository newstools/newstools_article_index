Deputy President William Ruto has defended the decision by the government to disband the National Olympic Committee.Ruto said the government had taken the decision as a result of a series of complains and clear cases of mismanagement witnessed during the Rio Olympics.The DP was speaking in New York when he met International Olympics committee President Thomas Bach on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. He said the ongoing probe on NOCK was necessary and those found culpable will be dealt with according to the law.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has refused to support the Government s move to disband NOCK.Instead, the IOC has, following a meeting between Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario and beleaguered Nock chairman Kipchoge Keino in Lausanne, agreed on a road map to implement reforms within the sports body.These reforms will include a review and update of Nock s constitution and the consequent plan to organize free and fair elections within three months.
