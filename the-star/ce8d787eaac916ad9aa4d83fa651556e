Former Eldoret South MP Peris Simam and her husband Enock Kimeli were detained on Friday after they were found guilty of corruption.This was after they were unable to pay fines amounting to more than Sh10 million as ordered by the court.Chief magistrate Wanjiku Cherere ordered Simam to pay the fine for 10 counts of corruption, failure of which she will serve 20 years in jail.The former MP, her husband and four other people faced charges related to economic crimes and abuse of office when she was in office between 2007-2013.Among the charges against her was influencing the award of a road construction tender to her company - Kachur Holdings.It was reported that more than Sh4.5 million was illegally paid out to the company.The former MP and her husband were charged alongside Laban Shachile, Pamella Maluti, John Simiyu and Wisdon Kimutai Maina.The first count stated that between January 6, 2010 and April 1 in Eldoret, they jointly conspired to commit an offense of economic crime - influencing the award of a tender for the improvement of Bayete-Chuiyat-Bargeiywa road in Eldoret South constituency.The charge sheet stated that the contract was awarded to Simam's company but that it did not qualify.The charge further stated that the tender was awarded in contravention of procurement regulations and that Simam worked as a public servant while being director of the company.The others were employees of the Kenya Rural Roads Authority. They were accused of illegally facilitating payment for the company, causing loss of public funds.The court found that the road was not repaired and that some documents used by the accused in the case had been falsified."As rightfully stated by the prosecution, Kenyans should know that embezzlement of public funds and economic crime and corruption do not pay," Cherere said."As a result of actions by the six accused the residents of Eldoret South did not get value for money. The worst part is that the lead player in this game was an MP entrusted to faithfully deal with public funds for the benefit of her constituents, but she failed to do so."Cherere ordered Simam to pay fines ranging between Sh700,000 to Sh5 million for the various counts she faced."The prosecution has proven all the 10 counts beyond reasonable doubt and I find the accused guilty," she ruled.Deputy director of prosecution Nicholas Mutuku sought maximum sentences for the accused.Lawyers for the accused said they would appeal against the judgement but Cherere ordered they be detained until Monday.She will rule then on their application for bond pending their appeal at the High Court.Read: Bribery, nepotism, tenders lead in county corruption
