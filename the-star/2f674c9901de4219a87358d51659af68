An MP has written to Parliament seeking the rejection of Philomena Mwilu as Kenya's next deputy Chief Justice.Kandara MP Alice Wahome wants the National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs committee to reject the judge's nomination.Wahome claims that Mwilu received a bribe of Sh3 million to influence the outcome of an election petition she (the MP) filed in 2008.She said the bribe was for the judge to rule against her in favour of former MP Maina Kamau.Wahome claimed she beat Kamau in the 2007 poll, and that the judge's ruling imposed the MP on residents of her constituency.Read: There were better candidates for DCJ than Mwilu, says MPThe MP said she wants the EACC to investigate the judge and that she was ready to provide evidence.The House committee is expected to consider the issues raised by the legislator during Mwilu's vetting slated for next week.Mwilu beat more than 13 candidates, who were interested in succeeding Kalpana Rawal, in interviews before the Judicial Service Commission panel .Rawal was forced to retire in June after the Supreme Court ruled that she had to leave office after turning 70.Her colleagues hailed her as a valuable team player whose choice was above board.Read: Nominated DCJ Philomena Mwilu hailed by judges as 'valuable team player'Also read: Mwilu s integrity, political neutrality landed her the DCJ job, sources revealBut Wahome said the DCJ nominee failed on principles of high moral character, integrity and impartiality, as demanded by the constitution, in her duties as a judge."I believe there were better candidates who were overlooked by the JSC in the nomination process," she said."I stand to be counted among those who will vote against her approval. She should be rejected by Parliament."She added that she will prove to the committee chaired by Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga that Mwilu committed violations.The MP said her election petition has not been concluded to date because of the judge's perceived interest in the matter.The legislator also noted that the judge was told to recuse herself from the case over the possibility of conflict of interest."She chose to stay put and also went ahead to admit ballot boxes that had been tampered with, as evidence in the petition," said Wahome."The record is clear that she has mishandled and mistreated cases that touch on women...I don't believe that she should be approved for the position."The MP further claimed that the judge, in a bench of three, delivered a ruling that outrightly undermined the rights of the women."She argued that the Supreme Court can transact its business without the constitutional requirement of the two- thirds gender rule," she said.The matter had been filed following the successful removal from office of former DCJ Nancy Barasa over allegations of assault against a security guard.At the time, Justice Njoki Ndungu was the only woman left on the bench of the seven-member court, prompting civil rights defenders to question whether the highest court in the country was properly constituted.The constitution provides that where the nomination of a candidate is rejected by the National Assembly, the appointing authority, in this case the president, may submit to the House the name of another candidate after another session of interviews.The procedure for approval will proceed accordingly.
