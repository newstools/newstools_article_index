Kwale governor Salim Mvurya has cautioned ODM leaders against any plan to talk ill of his decision to defect to Jubilee when Raila Odinga is hosted in the county on Thursday.Mvurya warned the group against any acts that border on disrespect for him or his administration during the two-day rallies scheduled in the area.He said that he would not stand the disrespect he was shown the last time Raila visited Kwale without involving him."Who can stand for that disrespect? I am not here to baby cry but for you but to say Kwale will be saved by a good leader not a party," Mvurya said.Raila is set to address a rally at Kinango on Thursday and a homecoming ceremony for ODM secretary general Agnes Zani (nominated senator) on Friday.Read: Raila in four-day tour of Coast and Mvurya backyard The governor said at Kinondo on Tuesday during a meeting with locals over mining issues, that he will not allow people to visit his backyard without a clear agenda."They must not disrespect me because I ditched ODM," he said referring to Mombasa governor Hassan Joho's comments at the ODM 10 at 10 fete at Mama Ngina grounds.He further defended himself against claims of being bought by Jubilee, saying: "We are not rich but we have God and we have wisdom that no one can remove from our heads."He said that Kwale county leaders deserve respect, and does not need another governor to come and remind people that 'their own is not the best.'"I have not gone to hold rallies in Tononoka or Mvita. Why should somebody come here to demean us?" Mvurya asked. Mvurya said he is not worried with the rallies meant to finish him, saying he stands firm with the people.Read: Mvurya joins Jubilee as vote hunt intensifies "Those who vowed to remove me from the seat are not serious, how can they remove me and it is the residents who elected me?" he posed.More on this: ODM set to replace 'cowardly' Mvurya in 2017 polls He reminded the former prime minister to that most of the land injustices in Kwale happened under his leadership in the grand coalition government.From the governor's comments, it has been perceived that his supporters are headed to a clash with those of ODM.Mvurya's supporters have warned that they will not allow politicians to disrespect them in their home ground. A section of them said they will do anything to ensure their master is not turned to be the agenda of the day during Raila's visit.Kasemeni MCA Anthony Yama asked Raila to stick to the agenda of selling their ideology to the people in Kwale."They must not turn Mvurya to be their agenda since that will not be allowed by his die-hard supporters," he said."We shall not allow their supporters to destroy our property and wish to ask them to be peaceful," said Yama.Other quarters view the take as an effort to control the damage caused by the county boss's exit to Jubilee.ODM has asked defectors who joined Jubilee to walk their talk and resign or get kicked out of the party.
