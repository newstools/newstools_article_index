Teso South MP Mary Emaase has said demands by the IEBC commissioners to be paid their send-off package before they leave office are uncalled for. What the commissioners need to do is vacate office and wait for their exit package at home, she said. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission officials are not more important than teachers, who have remained patient for several years. The commissioners will today know details of their individual exit packages. Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua said the talks were held under the law and parliamentary recommendations.Emaase said she will defend her seat on the Jubilee Party ticket. She said she is undisturbed by any challenge from her opponents.The MP spoke at Akites trading centre, Busia, on Friday during a jigger treatment campaign.She said President Uhuru Kenyatta will soon commission the tarmacking of the Busia-Malaba road and the Okame Technical Training Institute. During his tour the President will also commission the Alupe University. The national government has released Sh175 million for its construction, Emaase said.Other projects, like the Amukura Teachers Training College, will start next year, the MP added.
