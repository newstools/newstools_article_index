After an enjoyable morning spent mostly in the Athi basin, we drove up to the little dam near No. 10 junction. The dam was teeming with wildlife, including vultures. We sat and watched as they approached from the sky, landed one after the other, and seemingly challenged each other to enter the water first. No doubt some of them must have been at a kill somewhere. Eventually, the boldest vultures entered the water and started their cleaning ritual. They dipped each wing into the water first and then wet their heads a few times. After leaving the water, they flapped their wings a few times and then opened them wide and let the warmth of the sun dry them slowly.Vultures play a vital role in nature to clean-up carrion. Their sharp beaks and talons are efficiently designed to quickly reduce carcass remains to bones. The cleansing role they play ensures there is less disease by reducing flies. Sadly, many people do not know how important they are, and they have even been poisoned in some parts of Africa. Even though vultures do not look very handsome or beautiful, they can be fascinating to watch. Look out for them, as they often point to where predators have killed.There are predominantly three species of vulture in the Nairobi National Park: the larger lappet -faced vultures, white-backed vultures and ruppels-griffon vultures.So next time you are in the park, try a bit of vulture culture by looking for them. Who knows, they could reward you with large a cat sighting?
