More than 27 agriculture ministers in Africa will meet next week in Morocco to lobby for a share of the Sh10 trillion climate fund. Led by the agriculture minister in Morocco, the ministers including Kenya's Willy Bett will be pushing for a share of the proposed Sh10 trillion ($100 billion) climate fund towards agriculture adaptation by 2020. The initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture (AAA) to climate change aims to award a substantial share of the climate funds, which developed countries committed to provide to developing countries within the framework of the COP21 negotiations in Paris last year, said Aziz Akhannorch.He added that the initiative also seeks to promote and foster the implementation of specific projects to improve soil management, agricultural water control, and climate risk management. A continent long neglected, Africa can no longer be ignored. The era during which our Continent was treated as a mere object in international relations is over. Africa is progressing and is asserting itself in the international arena, he said last week during an African media tour to Morocco. We want to ensure agriculture issues are at the heart of the upcoming climate change meeting.We will defend the position of our Continent, which is greatly affected by climate change and sustainable development issues in the Conference of Parties 22 climate change meeting that will be held in November in Morocco, said Akhannorch.Climate change experts say that with a population that could double by 2050 and two thirds of the world arable lands, Africa should get committed to tackling food security challenge.Six of the ten most affected countries by climate change are in Africa, yet the continent has 65 percent of the world's unused arable lands.There are over 10 million climate refugees in Africa.The continent is only responsible for four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
