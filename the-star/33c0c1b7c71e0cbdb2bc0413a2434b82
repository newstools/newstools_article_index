The majority of Kenyan youths prefer pursuing diploma and certificate courses in universities to those in middle-level colleges.They do not want to join polytechnics, technical training colleges and vocational training centres.Senior assistant director of technical education Fredrick Mujumba yesterday said training opportunities in public technical and vocational institutions have increased by 40,963 due to a rise in the number of institutions, but many students still avoid them.National polytechnics have a capacity of 28,001 students. Technical and vocational colleges have a student capacity of 36,499, while vocational training centres have 80,905 capacity.These do not include the National Youth Service, which recruits thousands of youths for training in various centres countrywide.Mujumba said despite 121,128 training opportunities in public and TVETs, many students placed in the institutions by the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service still have low regard for them. There is a social inclination to universities. Middle-level colleges are perceived to be for the less academically endowed, Mujumba said.He said many still want to follow the traditional system of primary, secondary and university. Learners can join Vocational Training Centres, popularly known as Youth Polytechnics, for a certificate course after primary school, proceed to a Technical College for Diploma and university for a degree programme.Mujumba said the government has built 130 technical training institutions. He said construction of these institutions is complete, but they have no training equipment.China will provide equipment for the TVETs and the last batch of equipment is expected to be in the centres by March next year.Mujumba said 60 of them will start operating from January next year, while learning in the other 70 will begin in July.He spoke at a Nairobi hotel during a media briefing organised by the National Council for Population and Development.
