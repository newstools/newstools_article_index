The Boni in Lamu county has rejected a proposal to issue them with a block title deed. The community instead called for urgent land adjudication so every land owner gets a title deed.The Boni, a minority in the county, say the biggest problem they face is protecting their land from grabbers because they have no title deeds.Basuba MCA Mohamed Delo said, We are tired of living like squatters on our own land. Why won t the government recognise us and treat us like other communities [in Lamu]? We shall not accept a block title deed because we know we deserve individual title deeds, he said.Delo asked the state to allocate them part of the Boni Forest for farming as they can no longer hunt in it. Most of the Boni land is in the forest.The community was reacting to Linda Boni (anti-terror) Operation director James Serian s proposal that the state give them a block title deed to stop them from selling the land.
