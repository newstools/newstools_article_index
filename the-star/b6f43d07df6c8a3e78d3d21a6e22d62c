Cord is banking on Jubilee s perceived failure to address historical land injustices at the Coast to maintain its hold on the region.Jubilee has poached many leaders from ODM, including MPs Gideon Mung aro (Kilifi North), Mustafa Idd (Kilifi South), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), Kwale woman representative Zainab Chidzuga and Governor Salim Mvurya.ODM leaders said defectors are selfish, and that their defection is of no consequence. Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi is one of ODM s point men at the Coast. ODM has criticised Jubilee for failing to implement the TJRC report.On Saturday, Kingi said Jubilee is a stumbling block in resolving land injustices. He spoke during the burial of former Kilifi council officer Peter Mwamuye in Mwarakaya ward. He said the issuing of title deeds should be fast-tracked. President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Community Land Bill into law on August 31. It recognises title deeds acquired before Independence. Kingi said most residents live like squatters. He said the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission report is not being released because it contains the names of land grabbers who are senior politicians.
