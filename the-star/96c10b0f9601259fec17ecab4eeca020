Kajiado South MP Katoo ole Metito has said his endorsement as Maa spokesperson requires soul-searching among community members.Metito said on Saturday that the selection requires in-depth consultation among community stakeholders before floating the names of candidates."I will therefore not say much at the moment but [will] thank sincerely those who expressed confidence in me to lead them," the MP said on phone.Metito was responding to news that a section of Narok Maasai elders has chosen him as the late William ole Ntimama's successor.Last Wednesday, Shadrack Rotiken said the Narok chapter had settled on Metito to represent the Maasai community and its interests.He said the MP, who is in his 40s, exuded confidence to lead the community and will grow in the position.More on this: Maasai elders propose MP Katoo ole Metito as Ntimama successorRotiken came under intense heat from a section of Kajiado elders following the announcement.Council of elders chairman Hassan Kamwaro dismissed Rotiken's endorsement saying he does not have any mandate to speak on behalf of the community."All I know about Rotiken is that he is a non-governmental organisation called Orkila-Orok. I do not know his political masters," Kamwaro said.The chairman said for one to be a spokesman for the community, he or she cannot be picked but will emerge based on their track record."That person should be a tested leader who has the interest of his people at heart. He should not be sycophant of any political party but a person who has the quality to change the thinking of his people," Kamwaro said.He said people known to be chicken-hearted and who are not ready to be sacrificed on behalf of the community by the powers that be will never be spokespersons.More on this: As the Maasai mourn Ntimama, who s fit to fill legend s big shoes?
