Former Israeli president and elder statesman Shimon Peres, 93, died in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, prompting U.S. President Barack Obama to mourn: "A light has gone out, but the hope he gave us will burn forever".Peres, an indefatigable campaigner for Middle East peace who jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, was hospitalised following a stroke two weeks ago and died in Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv."There are few people who we share this world with who change the course of human history, not just through their role in human events, but because they expand our moral imagination and force us to expect more of ourselves. My friend Shimon was one of those people," Obama said in a statement.People walk past a news ticker announcing the death of former Israeli president Shimon Peres in Times Square in the Manhattan borough of New York, U.S., September 27, 2016.

In a career spanning nearly 70 years, he served in a dozen cabinets and was twice a Labour prime minister.He shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize with the late former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for reaching an interim peace deal in 1993 which never turned into a lasting treaty.Rabin was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli ultra-nationalist who opposed the interim accords, and it was Peres who took over as prime minister after Rabin's death.Peres is widely seen as having gained nuclear capabilities for Israel by procuring the secret Dimona reactor from France while defence ministry director-general in the 1950s. And as defence minister oversaw the 1976 Israeli rescue of hijacked Israelis at Entebbe airport in Uganda.Peres held the largely ceremonial post of president from 2007-2014 and used the pulpit to continue to advocate peace.Earlier in September, after a series of health scares including a mild heart attack, Peres received an artificial pacemaker.
