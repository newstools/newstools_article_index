The government has lifted the ban it imposed on the National Olympic Committee after the Rio Games as the nation attempts to rebuild faith in the organisation.Sports principal secretary Richard Ekai said NOCK was permitted to resume operations to enable it meet conditions and deadlines set at last week's meeting with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Lausanne.NOCK was disbanded on August 25 following public pressure and a directive from President Uhuru Kenyatta.Kenya bagged its biggest ever haul of medals in Brazil - six gold, six silver and one bronze - but doping allegations and organisational problems plagued preparations for the event.Ekai said they were happy about what happened after Rio because the NOCK needed to be reformed."Reforms must take place in NOCK and elections of new officials conducted before the end of the year. It is (for) NOCK to take the lead and conduct all these - hence the decision to lift the ban and enable them to function," he told reporters."We had a fruitful meeting in Lausanne and we struck a balance between our (national) sovereignty and IOC Charter," he added. "NOCK must follow the process within the set timelines."He spoke on Wednesday when three top officials of the NOCK - secretary general Francis Paul, vice-chairman Pius Ochieng and assistant treasurer Stephen Arap Soi, who was head of mission in Rio - appeared in court.They were charged with failure to declare uniforms donated by sports goods manufacturer Nike, fraud and theft of public funds.They all pleaded not guilty to the charges and were released on Sh200,000 cash bail each.More on this: Ex-NOCK officials charged with fraud, theft in Rio Olympics fiascoWario read a communique from IOC to a parliamentary committee on September 20.It said due process, particularly strict adherence to the Nock constitution and the Olympic Charter in all steps to reform Nock, must be followed.Nock is required to review and update its constitution and submit a copy of the amended version to IOC for approval before conducting elections.
