ODM has warned county and branch officials to stop vetting aspirants to elective seats in 2017. The new National Elections Board termed the vetting illegal and said it amounts to insubordination.It warned that tough disciplinary action will be taken against rogue officials. The new board is chaired by East Africa Legislative assembly member Judy Pareno (pictured). It issued the warning after meeting ODM leader Raila Odinga yesterday. The mandate to vet candidates belongs to the election board and nobody else. Those purporting to vet candidates, including some of our branch officials, should stop, Pareno said.ODM chairman John Mbadi assured all the aspirants that NEB will remain independent and will conduct free and fair primaries. Some ODM aspirants have been jittery that they could be rigged out in primaries.
