Members of the public can now own a room at an upmarket hotel for Sh4.5 million in a new equity model property developed by Heri Homes and Mt Zion Deliverance Church. The two partners are building the Sh150 million facility in Nyali, Mombasa.The hotel, which will have 84 rooms, a restaurant and a conference centre, is expected to be complete in a year. Heri Homes CEO Kimani Kimotho said each room will fetch on average Sh900,000 per year. This is a good deal for the public.In five years, you will have recouped your money and starting to earn profit, Kimotho said. Bishop Mark Kariuki for Deliverance Church, who graced the groundbreaking ceremony, said the church is committed to boosting the lives of Kenyans. We do not want a church that depends on its congregants to grow, but a church that helps lift the lives of its faithful and the general public, he said.
