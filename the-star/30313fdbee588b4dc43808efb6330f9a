A High Court will continue hearing the petition by Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero's wife to stop the EACC from using her bank details in probing him.Susan Mboya wants the the anti-graft body barred from obtaining details of her bank account for use in the case against Kidero.The case was postponed on grounds that her lawyer Tom Ojienda was held up on official duty at the Judicial Service Commission (JSC).Ojienda is among commissioners interviewing applicants for the deputy chief justice job.High Court Judge Joseph Onguto said on Tuesday that the case will not be postponed further, and set a hearing for Friday."The matter shall proceed whether Ojienda will be present or not," he said.Mboya is seeking to stop the commission from obtaining financial details of the spouses of people under investigations on graft allegations.The EACC sought to study her bank details - a directive she wants the court to declare unconstitutional and tantamount to discrimination on the basis of sex and marital status. Mboya argued that the EACC has no evidence implicating her in corruption and has subjected her to illegal and unnecessary investigations merely because she is married to Kidero."The commission victimised me for being the Governor's wife when it sought court orders to investigate my bank account at Commercial Bank of Africa in relation to an ongoing probe against the Governor," she said in court papers.Kidero at one point transferred Sh5 million to her account.

The justice also barred the anti-graft body from probing the Evans Kidero Foundation's account at Family Bank.
