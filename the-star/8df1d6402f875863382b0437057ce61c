There is no denying that Moi University in the last couple of years , has experienced many challenges including leadership, academic, staffing and infrastructure as demonstrated by the recent accreditation of the university s law school."Murkomen blamed the university management for lacking a clear succession policy, saying it has left many senior members of staff working in acting capacity.He said the vice chancellor appointment indicated there were power tussles at the senior management level.Murkomen urged Matiang i to expedite the hiring to end the wrangles that have followed Mibey's retirement after 10 years in office. He also said no candidate should be locked out based on tribe.The Senator said the university needs a VC who cannot be held hostage by cartels whose aim is to maintain the status quo.Students on Wednesday condemned protests, led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Elgeyo Marakwet's Alex Tolgos, against Ayiro's appointment.The group, who are members of the varsity's Nairobi campus student union, said it was wrong for Mandago and Tolgos to lead the demonstration.Through their chairman Edwin Kigoli, they said the governors and the MPs contravened Article 10 of the Constitution of Kenya.More on this: Moi University students condemn protests by Mandago against acting VC Ayiro
