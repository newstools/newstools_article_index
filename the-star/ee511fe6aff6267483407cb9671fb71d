Attorney General Githu Muigai has accused the judiciary of being the weakest link in Kenya's fight against corruption.Githu said Kenya has come a long way, save for land and other cases at the courts."The weakest link in the fight against corruption is in the courts," he said on Tuesday at the State House summit on accountability.The AG said they have also encountered more cases of white-collar crime."Institutional independence has led to a situation where we are being ineffectual. Independence has created a process that is incompetent," he noted.But he noted that not every part of the anti-corruption chain is broken.Muigai cited efforts to keep the system running, including his job which he said is to give evidence to those who need it.He added that the government has drafted bribery, whistle blower protection and omnibus anti-corruption bills to help fight corruption."Our public sector has automated systems in government namely IFMIS, company registration, electronic system in the judiciary," he said.Last year, former CJ Willy Mutunga created a new division in the High Court to deal with corruption and economic crimes.The Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division started working in Nairobi in January. The High Court in Nairobi has several divisions to deal with special cases.They include the Criminal, Constitutional and Human Rights Division, the Judicial Review, Commercial and Tax Division, the Family Division and the Land and Environment Division.There have been concerns that courts delay the hearing of corruption-related cases, slowing the war on graft. The creation of divisions has helped ease backlog.The lower court already has an Anti-Corruption Court, with magistrates hearing such cases.Read: New court for graft cases - CJ
