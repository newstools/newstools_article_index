The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has assured women of enough security during the 2017 election campaigns. The commission said most women candidates have complained of harassment and an unfair political environment. Commissioners Letile Layituli, Morris Dzoro and Linda Ochiel said women aspirants will get as fair a platform as the men. Politicians should sell ideas to voters not harass their opponents. The commission is ready to protect women to have a fair chance in their endeavour to seek political positions, Layituli said.The three commissioners were addressing Homa Bay women s groups in Mbita town on Wednesday. A society that cannot protect its women is a weak society. We, as Kenyans, have gone beyond this assertion, Layituli said.Dzoro said, We ll not hesitate to take stern action against those who will use derogatory, vulgar or demeaning language against their opponents, especially women, because they are the soft target. Ochiel said women must be involved in conflict management and prevention for economic empowerment and accountability.
