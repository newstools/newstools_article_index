A University of Nairobi student was yesterday charged with fraud in a Kibera court. David Mapili was allegedly part of a group that conned a businessman of iPhones during the Tokyo International Conference on Africa Development. Police reports show Mapili presented himself as Baringo Senator Gideon Moi s (pictured) personal assistant and was able to con the businessman.Mapili denied making a fake Local Purchase Order between April 26 and May 14 in Nairobi jointly with others not in court. He obtained 20 HP and 20 Lenovo laptops worth Sh3.2 million from Patna General Enterprises. Mapili allegedly pretended that a purchase order from the Foreign Affairs ministry was genuine.He was also charged with obtaining 20 iPhone 6s worth Sh1.6 million.Mapili s lawyer Edwin Sifuna asked the court for lenient bail.He said his client s rights were violated and one of the arresting officers threatened him when he visited Mapili. Sifuna further asked the court to reject the charges, saying his client faced the same charges at the Milimani law courts a few weeks ago.Principal magistrate Barbara Ojoo declined the application and directed the plea to be taken. She said the charges were not similar as claimed.Ojoo issued summons to the officer who allegedly threatened Sifuna, saying the officer should appear in court to respond to the lawyer s allegations.The case will be mentioned on September 27.
