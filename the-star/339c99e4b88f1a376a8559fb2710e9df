Chief Justice nominee David Maraga has told MPs vetting him that judges and magistrates should not be vetted as this instills fear instead of adding value.Maraga, a staunch Christian with strong Seventh Day Adventist Church beliefs, was nominated in September by the Judicial Service Commission to succeed retired Chief Justice Willy Mutunga."We do not need to vet judges and magistrates regularly because the JSC is mandated to deal with indiscipline," he told the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee panel on Thursday."We do not want to instill fear in judicial officers but a sense of accountability. The Judicial Service Commission can discipline those who err."Read: Judge David Maraga nominated Chief JusticeAlso read: The Bible and the law: Nominated Chief Justice David Maraga in profileMaraga said article 165 of the constitution allows the judiciary to issue injunctions on disciplinary matters. "The office of the Ombudsman also deals with the issue of complaints and I plan to strengthen it," he said.On terrorism, Maraga said the fight should not only be left to the executive."The three arms of government need to come together to discuss issues that affect our country. If we are able to sit and discuss then we can fight this," he said."No arm of government can have absolute power. That is why checks and balances exist."Maraga said when they receive terror suspects, they are forced to first look into the nature of the offence before making any decisions."We have to take into consideration the nature of the offense. I am a very liberal person and I deal with cases according to the law," he said.He said his duty is to make sure everyone coming to court, regardless of their religion and is accorded their constitutional rights.Maraga further said he will digitise documents in the judiciary and automate court proceedings."It is commitment to the work," he said. "I read my files thoroughly... this facilitates me in understanding the issues hence faster judgement."Maraga is being vetted on the backdrop of three petitions against his appointment. The public vetting is the final hurdle between the 66-year old and the coveted job, after grueling interviews by the JSC.Read: Some Jubilee MPs from Rift Valley plot to reject Maraga nomination Wandayi
