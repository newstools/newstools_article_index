JUST days after former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru (pictured) declared officially that she will run for Kirinyaga governor on the Jubilee Party ticket in 2017, three MPs from the county are questioning her suitability and integrity. The legislators say they can t trust her in managing the county s resources. They vowed not to back her bid for fear she is an escapist in leadership and could shift blame on someone else in the event questions are raised about misuse of public funds the way she laid blame on her former PS Peter Mangiti in the Sh791 million National Youth Service scandal. The MPs are said to support someone else for the top county seat, not Waiguru, whose failure to oversee the NYS messed up the service and ruined the lives of many jobless youths in the country. ********CORRIDORS has it that a senior City Hall official is drunk with power since ascending to high office. The man is reported to have been part of the mess in the county hospitals and it s reported he has become so powerful he neither cares to listen to nor give junior officers audience. Embittered critics say despite the official wielding so much power, he is unable to even fix a small problem. Small things like MPs calling him to release impounded motorbikes and payment of small amounts of money cannot be done. The man can t fix anything, said one MP. A city MP is reportedly lobbying MCAs to frustrate the man so that he exits City Hall. ********One of the aspirants in the Nairobi governor race is a man under siege. Recently, elders from his community declined to make him an elder. The elders said the man does not value family life and that he is not fit to be an elder. Those in the know say the man has been seeking the support of a tribal outlawed sect leader to support him both physically and spiritually. His associates fear he will not make it in the Nairobi governor race and want him to retreat to his home area and run for MP. *******THE Japanese delegation led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was not happy that President Uhuru Kenyatta could not attend the Universal Health Coverage session on Friday. Deputy President William Ruto represented Uhuru after Foreign Affairs PS Monica Juma informed the delegation the President could not make it. This session was very important for Japan, which announced more than $1.1 billion for UHC across Africa, and Kenya announced $5 million support to the Global Fund. Worse, the DP arrived late and the Japanese delegation complained to the organisers about keeping time. *******THE people around Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero are a happy lot after word went around that Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu ferried thousands of youths from Nairobi to register as voters in Kiambu during the mass voter listing in February. Kidero s insiders are now praying that the city boss s challenger at the March 4, 2013 polls continues exporting Jubilee voters from the capital to give their man a clear chance to retain the seat. The question is whether Kiambu Governor William Kabogo is aware of Waitutu s schemes.
