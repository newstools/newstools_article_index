It is a good thing that governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet) spent some time yesterday being interrogated by Directorate of Criminal Investigations detectives at DCI Headquarters. Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery should be commended for pushing the police to do their jobs following the governors deplorable behaviour last week.Mandago and Tolgos led MPs Oscar Sudi, Alfred Keter and Senator Isaac Melly in invading Moi University in Eldoret to oppose the appointment in an acting capacity of an out-of-county vice chancellor.The politicos protested against Prof Laban Ayiro s appointment to replace former VC Richard Mibei. They demanded Prof Isaac Kosgey, who is from the region, be installed instead.The police ought to have moved without the resulting outcry and Nkaissery s ministerial prompting.What the governors and legislators did is wrong and hateful. Hate speech leads to hateful actions. It must be nipped in the bud, lest Kenya returns to the toxic atmosphere that culminated in the 2008 PEV crisis.
