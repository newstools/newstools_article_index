Former MP Suleiman Shakombo faces an oblique future in ODM as far as nominations for the Likoni parliamentary seat are concerned.This became evident on Saturday when top party leaders, including ODM director of elections Junet Mohamed, publicly endorsed his rival, Mombasa MP Mishi Mboko. The incumbent is Masoud Mwahima, elected on the ODM ticket but has since defected to the Jubilee Party.Shakombo exited the political scene in 2007 after he lost to Mwahima who went ahead to retain the seat in 2013.He had served the constituency boss for a decade since 1997.Mohamed, who called Shakombo a Digo Council of Elder , said Mboko is best candidate to represent the interests of Likoni residents.Elders from Digo community in June endorsed Shakombo as their preferred candidate for MP. It is good that you have decided to join ODM because we are going to appoint you as the elder who will advise Jubilee on how we are going to defeat them in 2017, Junet sarcastically told Shakombo. All ODM leaders who convened for a funds drive at Mtongwe, Likoni, where Shakombo was also present, bashed the former Heritage minister calling him an old wood who should retire from politics.They were Mboko, Mohamed, Rashid Bedzimba (Kisauni), James Orengo (Siaya), Agnes Zani (nominated), Suleiman Dori (Msambweni), Fred Outa (Nyando) and Aisha Jumwa (Kilifi).Others present were Simba Arati (Dagoretti), Hassan Mwanyoha (Matuga), and Omar Mwinyi (Changamwe).But Shakombo said he will win despite the support his challenger received. Don t give sweet words yet you can t deliver anything. I promoted development the area MP and will do the same if elected, Shakombo said.
