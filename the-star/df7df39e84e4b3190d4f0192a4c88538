Tales of how wisdom comes with age have been told for centuries. And although a man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams, we risk the description there s no fool like an old fool when we fail to comprehend and accept that it is impossible to make old things new. Over the weekend, a senior member of a constitutional commission was hospitalised in Kisumu after developing health complications while in a room with a young lady. Perhaps in his attempts to overrule his age in order to excite, the man, who is in his 70s, is claimed to have taken more than a dose before losing consciousness. The cries by the young lady were enough to attract the much-needed assistance for the old man. What Corridors remains unsure about is whether the lady accompanied the old man to Kisumu or was sourced locally. ***********The fact that President Uhuru Kenyatta has put members of his extended family closest to the JP campaign purse strings has unsettled many who made money during the last campaign. Corridors has learnt that the Jubilee Party launch was basically a family affair, from the branding to merchandise such as T-shirts, leaving many electropreneurs in doubt about how to make money. Some are now looking for politicians likely to get the Jubilee ticket to see how to make quick cash. **********A governor in one of the North Rift counties is said to have fallen out with his party boss after rebuffing his financial demands. Corridors has it that the party boss had demanded to be paid Sh1 million tax-free every month from the county books as a sign of good will for the position the governor holds. When the governor queried his party boss on how the county books of account would be reconciled, the man labelled him arrogant and lacking respect. To make matters more uncomfortable for the county chief, an MP from the area was identified and the task was simple - to insult and malign him. The MP, who has had a fair share of run-ins with the governor, has since declared his interest in the governor s position.***********Just what happened to the Ford Kenya secretariat that was once located in Kileleshwa? Well, Corridors is told the party could not afford to pay rent and the owner threw the party out after months of default. In the process of this eviction, it is said that a number of documents were lost and the few that were salvaged were stored in a chicken house belonging to one of the officials for months, until a new secretariat was acquired along Ngong Road.
