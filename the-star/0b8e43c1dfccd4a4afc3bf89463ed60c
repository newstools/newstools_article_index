With regulars Victor Wayama and Ayub Timbe sitting out this evening s friendly international away in DR Congo, a search for Harambee Stars squad players to enhance their credentials beckons.Skipper Wanyama was excused from the squad after consultation with his club following his Man of the Match display in Totttenhma Hotspur s win at home to Manchester City in the English Premier league on Sunday. Coach Stanley Okumbi after consultation with Tottenham Hotspur has opted against calling the Harambee Stars team captain Victor Wanyama.The decision was made in the player s best interest, as the technical bench felt it would not be in Victor s best interest to play two matches in two continents in under 48 hours, said a statement from the Football Kenya Federation.Teddy Akumu should slot in seamlessly into the holding midfield role having previously played alongside the Spurs ace. Okumbi s big decision will be whether to give Spain based Ismael Gonzalez a starting berth alongside Akumu.Timbe has been the brightest spark of Okumbi s reign and the Belgian based winger will be solely missed in another fixture that OKumbi will want to win in order to improve the country s standing in the world football pecking order.In Timbe s absence it is likely that one of either Paul Were and Rama Salim will vie for the slot down the left attacking channel. The duo were among the Europeanbased players in the squad of 19 that will represent Kenya in today s friendly scheduled to be played at the Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa beginning 4.30pm East African time.Four others Michael Olunga, Gonzalez fresh call up Amos Ekhalie and Aboud Omar will link up with their compatriots straigth from their bases in Europe.With Kenya not involved in competitive action until the next qualifiers for the African Cup of Nations begin, it is these kind of matches that will shape up the team s preparations.The defence is certain to remain unchanged with Boniface Oluoch in goal, David Owino, Eric Ouma, Musa Mohammed and Brian Mandela manning the defense. Upfront Olunga will spearhead the attack as Jesse Were continues to struggle in front of goal.
