Musalia Mudavadi pulled out of the post-election cooperation pact with Jubilee because he realised the regime was failing Kenyans, George Khaniri has said.The Vihiga Senator said Mudavadi, who is Amani National Congress leader, agreed to partner with the opposition Cord coalition in the interest of the nation.Khaniri dismissed as naive, claims by UDF leader and Mumias East MP Ben Washiali that MPs moved from the outfit to Jubilee Party because Mudavadi led them into government. What Mudavadi has done is talk to like-minded political leaders in the interest of Kenya. He is not a leader of Washiali's ilk, who are stomach-driven, he told the Star by phone on Thursday. As concerned leaders, we have realised that pulling in the same direction, like we did in 2002 to kick Kanu out of power, is necessary to send this failing regime from power and save Kenyans from misrule."Mudavadi hinted on Sunday, during his two-day tour of the Coast, that he had been in talks with Cord leader Raila Odinga for the formation of a super alliance that will defeat JP in 2017.He said negotiations were in top gear for the creation of an alliance capable of winning the elections and supporting Kenyans.

He took us into a new marriage with Jubilee and we are comfortable in the marriage. He should not ask us to divorce from our nuptials to seek a new spouse, he said.Mudavadi's spokesman Kibisu Kabatesi asked Washiali to stop dragging the Amani leader's name in his unholy union with Jubilee Kabatesi said the cooperation agreed between UDF and Jubilee was signed by nominated colleague and UDF Chairman Hassan Osman, not Mudavadi. The fear of losing is turning Washiali to ranting disrespectful tantrums, he said in a statement on Wednesday.
