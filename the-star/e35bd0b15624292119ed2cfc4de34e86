Two more beer distributors have applied to join a suit that seeks to bar East Africa's largest brewer, EABL, from terminating contracts worth millions of shillings. Four Winds Trading Company and major distributor Kamahuha Ltd want the court to allow them participate in a suit filed by the brewer s largest distributor - Bia Tosha on grounds that the order sought by the firm affects them directly.The firms said it is important that they be enjoined as an interested parties since the orders they seek and the cause of action to be taken is similar to the one being pursued by Bia Tosha. The two firms, however will argue their case once a contempt application against EABL directors is resolved.Bia Tosha filed a petition claiming that EABL unlawfully terminated its distribution contracts for 22 routes.Similarly, Four winds and Kamahuha are accusing EABL of cancelling their contracts in breach of agreements entered between them and the brewer and in violation of their fundamental rights.Kamahuha, says it has been distributing EABL s product for the last 26 years and was shocked when the brewer terminated its contract on May 31, 2016.The distributor s director John Kiereini says the action by EABL is illegal since it had rights to distribute its products within Kamahuha territory that includes Ruiru, Githurai, Juja and Kamiti. We have been renewing our agreements with EABL from time to time over the years. Before the last three-year contract expired, we engaged negotiations with the brewer and the fact is the agreement remained in force, said KiereiniOn its part, Four wind which is also aggrieved following a termination of its contract explains that it entered into a distribution agreement on July 1, 2001.The firm says it paid goodwill fees amounting to Sh19.3 million to the brewer after which it was given specific routes to distribute.According to the firm's director Stephen Muturi,the agreements were executed and took effect on October 1, 2012 .All these were hinged on the goodwill that was paid by the distributor to secure the said territories. Unfortunately despite the heavy investments injected into the business and the risk undertaken, EABL went ahead to terminate the distribution agreement and stopped forthwith supplying their products to us, says MuturiMuturi adds that the failure by EABL to supply them with products and by allocating another distributor its territory, it has suffered great losses which continue to accrue to date.
