Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli wants the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission stopped from interfering with hiring of NSSF chief executive.He castigated the anti-graft agency for summoning the yet-to-be hired NSSF trustee saying the EACC has no mandate to question such persons unless the NSSF board requests for such a probe.Atwoli said the EACC is only out to influence the process of hiring the new CEO so as to gain access to worker&#39;s money for 2017 polls.&quot;The EACC has written a letter to NSSF where they are saying that we must send names of the appointees for them to chose for us a CEO. The NSSF Act does not say the power to appoint lies with the EACC,&quot; he said in Nakuru on Thursday.&quot;They are interfering with the appointment of CEO because of their vested interest in the workers&#39; money for 2017 elections,&quot; Atwoli said.He said it is not a practice for boards of state corporations to cede powers to recruit, discipline workers to the anti-corruption commission.&quot;It is the board that can chose to request the EACC to cross check whether those that are set to be appointed have a clean record and not vise versa,&quot; Atwoli said.He said that even the current NSSF CEO Anthony Omerikwa has been summoned at the EACC, adding that they will move to court to stop the anti-graft team from such interference.&quot;As a workers&rsquo; representative in the NSSF board, we will move to court to stop EACC from interfering with the ongoing recruitment,&quot; he said.
