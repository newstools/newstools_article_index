The Immigration department has ordered Ezekiel Mutua to immediately surrender his diplomatic passport days after he bragged about getting it without following procedure.Director general Gordon Kihalangwa said on Thursday that the KFCB chief executive does not qualify to hold a diplomatic passport.Kihalangwa said the document will be exchanged for an ordinary one, according to the Third schedule of persons entitled to Diplomatic passports, as per the Kenya Subsidiary Legislation of 2012."Ezekiel Mutua is a holder of a diplomatic passport he got back in February 2013 when he was in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs," he said on Twitter during the department's live chat.He noted policy states that the document must be returned upon the completion of duty that qualified one for it.The department decided to recall the passport after Mutua posted it on Facebook, thanking the Foreign Affairs ministry and US Embassy officials."I did not even have to go to the embassy for biometrics or pay the visa application fee. It was delivered to my office free of charge," he said.The CEO reacted to remarks by a journalist that he would never set foot in the "land of milk and honey" due to his stand on lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders and atheists.Read: Ezekiel Mutua bans 'girls only' party, terms it 'orgy of lesbians'Mutua's post led to a heated exchange after someone wrote in a local daily that: "I will never get a visa to the US".But the Kenya Film Classification Board CEO insulted his friends on the social media platform after users trolled him for the post on Monday.Mutua, who has been vocal about 'promoting moral values', also resorted to 'unfriending' anyone who criticised the post.He later posted more photos of himself flying first class to Dubai and later San Francisco.Read: Ezekiel Mutua insults Facebook friends for trolling post on diplomatic passportThe constitution says people entitled to the passports include the President and DP, their immediate families and Speakers of Parliament.Senior security officers including the IG, Chief of Defence Forces, KDF Service Commanders,governors, Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice and their immediate families also qualify.In the event the country has a Prime Minister, such a person and his immediate family are also entitled to the document.
