A group of women residing in Nairobi slums are appealing to well wishers and partners to help them construct homes on four acres of land they bought in Limuru.They raised Sh18 million in July to buy the land for construction of flats.The women who started Diamond Women of Kenya group in 2014, said the quest for decent housing pushed them to start the welfare group.Speaking during a tour of the land in the outskirts of Limuru town last week, the 500 women said they are tired of living in squalid conditions in slums and want to have privacy."As a woman in the slums, life is unbearable. Living in a single small mabati room with your family is simply dehumanising. We really want to see ourselves in our own houses," said Mary Njuguna the group's chairperson.She said demand for decent housing was a key factor in formation of the group.The group's patron who is Mandeleo ya Wanawake Nairobi county chairperson Martha Miyandazi said that they are looking for a partner who can help them start the housing project.
