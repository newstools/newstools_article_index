The government has repossessed the Eldoret State Lodge land that had been grabbed by a private developer, Public Works PS Paul Maringa has said. He said all state lodges are being renovated to improve their standards. Maringa spoke on Thursday after inspecting the Eldoret State Lodge. He said the ministry is keen to ensure the facilities that represent the face of the government are in good condition.Maringa said they have visited the lodges in Sagana, Mombasa, Nakuru and Eldoret.He said next week they will tour the Cherangany, Kitale, Kakamega and then Kisumu state lodges. It is important to note that we will not condone corruption like grabbing of public land, Maringa said. He said the private developer has not moved to court to contest the decision to return the land to the state. Last year, the National Land Commission ruled that the private developer had illegally acquired the land.
