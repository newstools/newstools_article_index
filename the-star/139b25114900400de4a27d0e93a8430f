 The party won t lack someone to replace him The exit of Funyula MP Paul Otuoma as ODM national vice chairman will not undermine the party s prominence in Western, Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has said.Midiwo said Western people are not in ODM because they were told by an individual, but because they believe in the party s ideologies. He spoke in Gem on Sunday during a funds drive at Ndori Primary School. Midiwo said an individual cannot make ODM lose its grip on Western. The Gem MP said ODM will not be distracted as it s a movement. Midiwo said ODM is and will remain strong. He said the party will not have a problem replacing Otuoma. Budalang i MP Ababu Namwamba is also making weird remarks about the party, but I expect that, especially after seeing him with Gumo, Midiwo said. He said he believes it s not Ababu and Otuoma talking, but forces from other quarters. How can Otuoma and Ababu say they are not respected by the ODM leaders when they are the top party leaders? Do they want to be on the same platform as [party leader] Raila Odinga? Midiwo said.The deputy minority leader said nobody has ever dared ODM, either from within or outside, and survived politically . He said Ababu is wrong to say his powers were reduced when the party constitution has not been changed. The same powers attached to Ababu are the same powers Anyang Nyong o had and whether he remains or leaves, those powers will remain the same, unless they are changed, Midiwo said. Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi, who spoke separately, said some ODM legislators are the stumbling block to Raila s success.
