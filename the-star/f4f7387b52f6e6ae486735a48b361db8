The Education ministry yesterday interdicted the Siaya Education director and six subcounty directors over violation of exam guidelines after it emerged that primary schools are doing mock exams.The government banned mock exams in July last year to contain student unrest and only allow internal exams.The ministry also dissolved the Education board and asked stakeholders to nominate new members.This comes after news that the Siaya government spent Sh1.7 million to print standard eight mock exam papers bearing Governor Cornel Rasanga s photo.Standard eight candidates were given the mock exam papers on Tuesday. Residents questioned whether it was necessary to have the mugshot.The ministry said the state is in charge of education, not the county. It said having the tests a few weeks to the national exams frustrates Knec s efforts in preparing for KCPE exams.The ministry said it will punish officials who do not enforce policies.Siaya Education executive Pamela Okello had earlier said the county funded the mock exams and used Rasanga s photo as a quality assurance mark to distinguish the county s mock papers from other mock papers, and to cushion parents from exploitation. We have previously received complaints from parents that they are being made to pay examination money, even after the CDF and other donors have facilitated the same. That is why we branded the paper, she said.Okello said some teachers and school heads approach organisations to sponsor exams and still ask parents and the county to pay for the tests.She spoke on Tuesday at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology and again spoke to the Star on the phone yesterday.The county s actions will help improve the performance of pupils in national exams, she said.Okello denied that the exam papers are being used for Rasanga s reelection campaign, and said the county government cannot politicise education.But residents complained on social media and accused the governor of using county cash for campaigns.Vincent Ochieng said the county logo could have been used instead of the photo. It was not necessary for Rasanga s photo to appear on the exam paper as he did not personally fund it. A teacher said if that is the trend then soon the President s photo will be put on KCSE and KCPE exam papers.
