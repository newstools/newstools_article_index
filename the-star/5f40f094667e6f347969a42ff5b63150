Nairobi county has a water deficit of 200,000 cubic metres per day. It gets a supply of slightly more than 500,000 cubic metres per day against demand of 700,000 cubic metres. The city depends on supply from five water sources under the facilitation of the Athi Water Services Board. Sasumua Dam supplies 52,800 cubic metres per day, Kikuyu Springs supplies 4,000 cubic metres, Ruiru Dam 22,800 cubic metres, Ngethu Water Works 379,200 cubic metres and the Thika Dam 91,200 cubic metres. Water CS Eugene Wamalwa yesterday said the ministry and the board are working on projects to increase water supply in Nairobi. He cited the Northern Collector Tunnel Project, which is projected to deliver an additional 140 million cubic metres of water a day to Nairobi and its satellite towns. Wamalwa said Nairobi will host the first Kenya Water Week next month and invite experts from other countries to share how they sustain supply.
