Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has defended DP William Ruto over claims that he is to blame for the sackings of a number of senior Kalenjin officials from the government.Murkomen said those accusing the Deputy President are attempting to reduce him to a tribal leader, yet he is a national leader dealing with the interests of all Kenyans.Last week, a post with a list of all Kalenjin individuals allegedly sacked from the government in the last three years was circulated on social media, blaming Ruto for failing to defend them as a key leader from the region and being second in command.There has also been an outcry from the Kalenjins over what they said was unfair distribution of job opportunities in the government. Many are concerned about the continued replacement of our people while Ruto remains quiet. Those blaming DP Ruto need to understand employment is done on merit. Those who feel the DP has not helped must be told he represents all Kenyans. There is no way he will stoop that low and engage in such a debate, Murkomen said. Among those listed as having been sacked include former Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo, former judiciary Registrar Gladys Shollei, former director National Youth Service Kiplimo Ruto and former Energy CS Davies Chirchir.
