National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale wants Kenya Airways managers probed over flight delays experienced on October 2.Duale, who is also Garissa Town MP, said the bosses should appear before the Transport committee to explain the hitch that saw more than 24 flights cancelled."Parliament has the oversight role of making sure Kenyans get the services they pay for, especially given the high cost charged for tickets by the airline," he stated.He said he paid Sh53,000 - the cost of a flight to Bombay - yet was at the airport for hours."We cannot pay such monies and be stranded here without explanations," he said.Duale also asked the airport to apologise to clients for the delay that lasted more than six hours, and affected people including former politician Kenneth Matiba and his family.Read: Kenneth Matiba among hundreds stranded for over 5 hours as KQ cancels flightsAlso read: Flight delays cause travel hell at JKIA, passengers strandedTourism stakeholders have hit out at the national carrier over its expensive tickets and inefficiencies caused by delayed flights, sabotaging the growth of the sector.The airline's ground director, Francis Musila, found himself on the receiving end of sharp criticism against KQ during the Tourism Summit held at Mombasa State House.Musila tried to respond to the concerns by assuring the stakeholders that the prices of KQ air tickets have come down, but he was cut short by the murmurs and jeers from the audience.
