The Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU) has asked political leaders to stop interfering with management of universities in the country.UASU Secretary at Moi University Jack Abok says the recent protest by Governor Jackson Mandago, his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos and MPs amounted to serious interference with the independence of the institution.At the same time, more than 100 MCAs from Uasin Gishu, Nandi and Trans Nzoia defended Mandago and the MPs who stormed the university saying the action did not amount to perpetrating tribalism.Abok says political interference was to blame for some of the problems which the universities face currently."The politicians should help by providing leadership; be a link between the university and the community instead of behaving in way that amounts to incitement," said Abok.Read: Uasu wants Moi University ex-VC to go home and Sh1bn staff deductions paid He said eventhough the political leaders had their right to air their view on issues at the university, they should have used proper channels which will preserve the respect and dignity of the college.The politicians stormed the university on Tuesday to stop acting Vice Chancellor Professor Laban Ayiro from taking over from Professor Richard Mibey.Read: [AUDIO] Two governors, MPs storm Moi University over new 'outsider' VC AyiroThey demanded that Professor Isaac Kosgey, whom they claimed had topped during recruitment interviews, should be installed as VC.However, Abok said Professor Kosgey was already contributing to academic development in the country and deserves respect instead of being made to look like a political pushover for some leaders.The MCAs, led by majority leaders for Uasin Gishu Josphat Lowoi and his Elgeyo counterpart Wilson Boit said statements made by the political leaders at the university had been misinterpreted to imply that the Kalenjin community was tribal."Our leaders only talked of merit being followed in the recruitment of the new VC at the university. They never talked of rejecting anyone because he is from another tribe," said Lowoi.Lowoi wondered why other universities were being headed by people from regions where they are located without any complains."When it comes to our institutions in Eldoret that is when we are reminded of tribalism," said Lowoi.They accused Education CS Fred Matiangi of mismanaging the education sector, saying he as also to blame for the recent fire incidents at secondary schools.Extra security personnel were deployed at the university where another 2,500 students graduated on Friday amid tension after political leaders threatened to disrupt the fete.Read: Tight security as Moi University conducts 32nd graduation ceremony Ayiro who took over from Professor Richard Mibey on Wednesday said leaders and managers should be humble and embrace dialogue to sort out disputes.Governor Mandago has denied being tribal even as more quarters came out to condemn the protest.Read: Moi University students condemn protests by Mandago against acting VC Ayiro hiring
