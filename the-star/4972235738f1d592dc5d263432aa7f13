The Borana and Somali communities in Isiolo and Garissa counties have resolved to end perennial clashes and demarcate their boundary.The communities have been embroiled in bloody border clashes, but now have accepted binding resolutions to ensure peaceful coexistence.Their relationship worsened because of cattle rustling and competition for water and grazing fields.The clashes erupted a month ago. They left at least 10 people dead, and more than a 100 displaced.Many residents have lost their livestock and property worth millions of shillings. The worst-hit areas are Tana, Brambati, Makadakal, Belgish and Boji.The spate of killings led to a public outcry, with peace lobbies urging the national government to intervene.The resolutions were arrived at yesterday in Nanyuki, during a peace and security meeting that brought together their representatives. One resolution calls on politicians and leaders to desist from inciting their communities.Another calls for an end to further construction in the disputed areas, whether through the CDF or by individuals and county governments until boundary issues are resolved.Also, the agreement requires pastoralists to first seek grazing permission from the host communities when there is drought.Other resolutions include registration of firearms in the hands of civilians. All residents who own firearms illegally are required to surrender them.They also agreed that all illegal roadblocks placed by bandits between Garbatula, Isiolo and Modogashe be removed and patrols be increased to 24 hours.There will be a review of all existing peace agreements. Once done, all residents will have to respect and enforce deliberations. In line with this, grassroots peace meetings will be organised regularly.The meeting was organised by the NCIC and attended by commission chairman Francis ole Kaparo, Northeastern and Eastern regional coordinators, peace advocacy groups and county security committees.Others in attendance were political leaders, including Garissa Governor Nathif Jama and Isiolo Governor Godana Doyo.Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye, from whose constituency some of the worst-affected come, said he is optimistic the resolutions will restore sanity.
