Mandera Governor Ali Roba has said he will seek reelection, despite the Garre Council of Elders decision to bar him from running.He said the elders should get in touch with the mood of the people or risk becoming irrelevant. Roba addressed Mandera West subcounty residents on Thursday when he inspected projects.During last month s meeting in Banisa town, the Council of Elders said the governor, all four MPs, the woman representative, senator and 18 MCAs should not seek reelection.They said they will endorse new candidates from across the sub-clans. Roba urged the elders to let residents decide which leaders they want. I have traversed the county and the support I have received from Mandera residents is overwhelming. The elders decision has no role to play in the current politics, Roba said. I am happy and extremely touched by the support I have received. I hope to do my best to ensure Mandera is transformed into a better county. Roba s supporters have accused the elders of favouritism when making endorsements.Senator Billow Kerrow, the four MPs and woman representative have accepted the elders decision.
