President Uhuru Kenyatta has declined to sign a bill that would have compelled Kenya Power to compensate customers for blackouts lasting over three hours.Uhuru declined to assent the bill in order to give Kenya Power time as they upgrade their supply network. But he said the bill could be returned to Parliament for amendments after a stipulated time.The Energy Bill 2015 sought to compel Kenya Power to compensate customers for losses incurred during blackouts exceeding three hours in case the company failed to issue a 24-hour notice prior to such an outage.Compensation also included physical injuries that arose from such blackouts.The Bill was passed by both Parliament and the Senate in May before it was forwarded to the President for assent.More on this: Energy Bill awaits President s signature after legislators passed it yesterdayMvita MP Abdulswamad Shariff who sponsored the Bill said it was meant to check the conduct of the company given that it is a monopoly."The whole idea is not to punish anyone, but honestly they need to pull up their socks," Shariff told the Star in a previous interview.The compensation, according to the bill, was to be paid in form of a subsidy incorporated in the customer's bill. Compensation to those who suffer physical injuries was to be determined by the court. Repayments were to be equal to the amount of loss incurred as presented by the consumer and verified by Kenya Power.But the Bill also cited a few exemptions in compensation such as cases of heavy downpour and natural calamities.The International Energy Agency (IEA) last year said that Kenyan households and factories are plunged into darkness for an average of 25 days every year due to blackouts.In its most recent report, Kenya Power has at least 2.7 million customers countrywide.
