The standoff between the national and Mombasa governments will only hurt residents, senator hopeful Abdulsalaam Kassim has said. He said Governor Hassan Joho and Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa should end their spat over everything . Joho and President Uhuru Kenyatta have differed over the past year. Both governments now claim 22 acres at VoK, Nyali constituency. Marwa threatened to arrest Joho when he led youth to demolish a perimeter wall around the disputed land last week. On Monday, Kassim said the two leaders should show maturity and focus on providing services. The professional boxer said disrespect between the national and county governments sets a bad precedent and lead to chaos. On Tuesday, there was a standoff between the police and county askaris when both governments sent guards to the land. One group was ordered to ensure no construction goes on while the other s task was to ensure no one stops the construction. It is wrong for leaders to trade accusations in public at the expense of development and services, Kassim said. He will run for seantor on the JP ticket.
