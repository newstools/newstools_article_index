Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma has supported calls to have joint Cord nominations to ensure the coalition wins the presidency. He said through the joint nomination process, Cord will be a formidable force by fielding a single presidential candidate. Kaluma said the joint coalition primaries would also make its affiliate parties concentrate on consolidating their support to clinch many MPs and Senate seats. We want to have a situation where all aspirants in Cord help campaign for our presidential candidate, he said.Kaluma urged opposition leaders to put aside inter-party competition to make Cord strong. You cannot govern this country without having the majority in the House, especially in the National Assembly. All those who have Cord s interests at heart must prepare to make it a government with a strong Parliament, he said.Kaluma spoke on Ramogi FM during a talk show on Wednesday. The MP urged the three Cord co-principals, Raila Odinga, Moses Wetang ula and Kalonzo Musyoka to put aside their personal interests for unity s sake.Kaluma said Cord will only take power if its leaders and supporters remain united. I m appealing to everybody in Cord to swallow their egos and accept joint nominations. This will show our seriousness to win the presidency, he said. Kaluma said all leaders must not insist that their names appear on the ballot.The legislator said Cord has strong support across the country.
