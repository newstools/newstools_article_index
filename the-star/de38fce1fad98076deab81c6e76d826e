Civil society groups on Wednesday warned of influence from the executive in the nomination of judge David Maraga for the position of CJ.They said it was part of a wider scheme to interfere with the independence of government institutions.They also alleged that the nomination was meant to tame opposition and the civil society groups, while defending executive interests in succession politics in 2017 and 2022. It is common knowledge that two members in the JSC served both URP and TNA and now they are sitting on a team to appoint a person who will rule on the 2017 and 2022 election petitions in the Supreme Court, said Ndung u Wanaina of the International Centre for Policy and Conflict.Wanaina added that most of the JSC members serve the interests of the state at the expense of Kenyans.He said the few left in the team cannot operate independently since executive appointees are crowded at the commission. When you have persons from one [ethnic community] heading all security arms of the government, it is clear you are up to something not good for Kenyans," he said."This team is loyal to you and not ready to serve the interests of Kenyans but the master somewhere."Read: Raila, Ongwae join Kenyans in welcoming Chief Justice nominee David MaragaThe constitutional expert stated that Parliament is gagged through Speaker Justine Muturi, whom he said is loyal to President Uhuru Kenyatta. After the JSC was compromised it was a clear indication that the process of recruiting the Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya does not meet any standards," he said."The next victim will be the county government through intimidation and change of the laws."Maraga was selected from a group of 11 candidates after two of those who applied bowed out. The 10 included Supreme Court judges Smokin Wanjala and Jackton Ojwang.Also read: The Bible and the law: Nominated Chief Justice David Maraga in profileOthers were Appellate Court judges Alnashir Visram and Roselyn Nambuye, High Court judge Mbogholi Msagha, Constitutional expert, Nzamba Kitonga, and Professor Makau Mutua.The JSC also received application from East African Court of Appeal judge Aaron Ringera, Principal Administrative Secretary in the Office of the Deputy President Daniel Wambura and Advocate Lucy Wanja.
