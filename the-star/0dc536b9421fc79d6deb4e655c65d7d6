Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba has said he still respects Raila Odinga as an elder and politician who has laboured to transform Kenyans' livelihoods.Ababu, who quit his secretary general post in Raila's ODM party and relaunched LPK, said he had no personal differences with the opposition leader."I respect Raila as I do other leaders," he said as he answered questions fielded by members of the Busia Political Forum on Monday."I ask that we all strive to do the same. I quit my position in ODM due to irreconcilable differences on how the party is managed, best exemplified by bungled Kasarani elections and deliberate schemes to emasculate the office of the SG."During his tour of Western region shortly after Ababu s departure from the orange party on July 6, Raila told the outspoken legislator to return to ODM.The MP resigned citing frustration by some of the party's executive members. He said he would lead a movement aimed at uniting the Luhya community ahead of the 2017 poll.There was speculation that he would join the ruling Jubilee coalition but this was not the case, sparking declarations that his political career was spiraling to its end.But Ababu said: "May I also add that I have always had a cordial relationship with President Uhuru Kenyatta."I believe political rivalry does not and must never amount to enmity. Cordial relations with a rival are not about that mole joke. It is just political maturity."Read: Those calling me a mole cost Raila top job - AbabuAlso read: I am flattered but unavailable, Ababu tells Ruto on joining JubileeAbabu formed his 'Third Force' movement with Funyula MP Paul Otuoma and Sirisia s John Waluke.But Otuoma has returned to ODM while Waluke has joined Jubilee Party.
