The Makueni government has threatened to sue the Kenya Wildlife Service for evicting residents living on disputed land in Mikululo village, Kibwezi. The land neighbours the Chyullu Hills National Park.Governor Kivutha Kibwana accused the KWS of invading the land without notice and disobeying a court order. We have to take legal action against KWS for evicting the residents and exposing them to suffering, he said.On Thursday afternoon, rangers accompanied by regular and Administration Police officers invaded homes and set houses on fire, as terrified residents scampered for safety.The KWS and the community claim ownership of the land, which has been the subject of a protracted court battle. Speaking to the media yesterday, Kibwana urged the national government to respect the lives of the people and the rule of law.He said Makueni residents have been subjected to perpetual suffering and abject poverty due to land disputes that the national government has failed to address for decades. We are not encouraging encroachment, but we will not be silent when our people are being exposed to unnecessary suffering by a government responsible for protecting them, Kibwana said.
