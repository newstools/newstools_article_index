The Parliamentary Budget Office has warned that the high public debt will undermine Kenya s economic growth.As at March 2016, the the national outstanding debt stood at Sh3.312 trillion. The PBO s 2016-27 budget watch report says the debt is expected to increase. The country borrows heavily to finance key infrastructure projects like the standard gauge railway. The increase is already having an effect on growth rates through limiting the achievement of maximum growth, the report says.The PBO cites studies by the International Monetary Fund in 2013 that show large public debt can lower GDP. This year, the middle-term debt strategy paper indicates the government will pursue 60 per cent external borrowing.The report tabled in the National Assembly says the challenge lies in maximising the link between debt accumulation and benefits.The report also notes the increase in external debt has financed the SGR from Mombasa to Nairobi and to Busia. It is projected to extend to Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo.The SGR and other major infrastructure projects are financed with loans from China and other partners such as the African Development Bank and the International Development Assistance fund.The borrowing, according to the report, has increased interest-related payables to be incurred every financial year.
