Kiambu Governor William Kabogo on Saturday urged the youth and women to form groups and apply for the Biashara Fund.He said the fund has helped reduce unemployment by 60 per cent since its inception in October 2014. Kabogo said Sh500 million has been disbursed to youth and women s groups and the disabled. He spoke in Ruiru town. When I started the initiative, my aim was to empower our youth, women and disabled persons, to start businesses and fight poverty. There are some youths out there without jobs, yet this money is lying idle, Kabogo said. They should seize this noble chance and get the money to start activities that will give them high returns. He said the county will reach more the Biashara Fund cash to Sh1 billion next year to increase beneficiaries. We want more people to benefit. This is the best way to zero rate poverty. I believe residents have ideas they can use to generate income. Ours is to give them financial help, Kabogo said.
