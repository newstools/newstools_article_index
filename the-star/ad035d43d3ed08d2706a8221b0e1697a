Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has honoured his promise to give Sh1 million to the ward that topped in mass voter registration in the county.Ranguma made the promise during the February 2016 mass voter registration project that the ward with the highest registrations would be rewarded.He said the initiative was aimed at encouraging voters to come out.Ranguma gave the Sh1 million cheque at an ODM delegates conference at Citam Hall in Kisumu on Saturday.The cheque was presented to ODM officials led by deputy leader and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.The party will decide on the ward to be awarded after analysing the data.Ranguma said he is committed to supporting the party to ensure leader Raila Odinga becomes the next President. I will mobilise residents to register in large numbers to ensure ODM forms the next government, he said.Ranguma urged Nyanza politicians to avoid cheap politics that can affect Raila s chances of winning. We should focus our energy on the goal of forming the next government. Political competition should be issue-based, rather than engaging on witch-hunt and propaganda, he said.
