Lamu West MP Julius Ndegwa was on Thursday warned by a Mombasa court against threatening witnesses in a case where he is charged with abuse of office.The court said Ndegwa's bond would be cancelled if he happens to threaten witnesses again.Assistant DPP Alexander Muteti told the court he had received information that Ndegwa was issuing threats to EACC officers and other officers who are witnesses in the case."If the accused person fails to follow as the court has ordered, adverse action shall be taken against him," said chief magistrate Julius Nang ea.The prosecution had applied for Ndegwa s bail to be cancelled following the threats administered to the EACC officer.But Ndegwa's lawyer Jared Magolo apologised on his client's behalf saying it would not happen again.Ndegwa is accused of taking Sh1 million meant for the administration of the CDF office.He was also charged alongside four people with conspiring to commit an economic crime.The MP, Michael Thegeru, Yussuf Hassan, Sophia Wanjiru and Zakayo Gitonga were charged with irregularly transferring Sh1.6 million from the CDF account between July 1 and October 10, 2013.The court was told the money was allocated for the construction of the Witu livestock cattle dip.The five denied the charges before Mombasa chief magistrate Susan Shitubi.The MP was ordered to report to the EACC offices in seven days to have their fingerprints taken.The case will be mentioned in December 7.
