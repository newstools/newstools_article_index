A number of city youths are jostling for the position of Jubilee youth chairman. Several candidates have started campaigns. Candidate Samwel Mundia, who is Mathare MP Stephen Kariuki s personal assistant, has been meeting youths.He told the Star he has what it takes to lead the youth and drum up support for the party. Mundia said the majority of Kenyans are below the age of 30, yet the people in power are still the same recycled old individuals . We sing and cry foul year after year about how the youth should lead, but we don t match it with actions, he said.
