Senators yesterday questioned Kitui Governor Julius Malombe about why his government reimbursed Sh511 million to the national government with no supporting documents.Auditor General Edward Ouko s 2013-14 report noted the money refunded was meant for staff salaries. They could not be authenticated because of missing monthly payrolls.Ouko said the county administration did not provide details on staff schedules and salary breakdowns per ministry. This made it difficult to confirm the accuracy of the amount reimbursed.Senators George Khaniri (Vihiga) and Hassan Omar (Mombsa) said without the schedule and payroll, it is hard to ascertain if the money was actually reimbursed. Malombe said documents will be provided to show that the money was reimbursed to the national government.
