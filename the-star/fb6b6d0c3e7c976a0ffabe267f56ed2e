Three Kenyan Premier League clubs and a Division Two outfit have received the Fifa Solidarity fee paid by Swedish top tier club Djurgaardens IF for striker Michael Olunga.The solidarity money is a percentage of a player s transfer fee paid to clubs who contributed to the player s development when below 23 years-of-age.The quartet, Gor Mahia, Thika United, Tusker and Liberty Sports all contributed to Olunga s development before he joined the professional ranks in Sweden at the beginning of this season.In a press statement from the Football Kenya Federation, FKF chief executive Robert Muthomi said he was not at liberty to reveal how much each club received from the solidarity payments saying that is the prerogative of the clubs to reveal.The statement read in part, One of our priorities as an FA is to not only ensure that clubs generate income from gate collections, sponsorships and player transfers but also from unexploited revenue streams like the Fifa solidarity contribution mechanism. In this perspective, we have in the last six months or so engaged the Swedish FA and Olunga s current club Djurgaardens IF, in an effort aimed at ensuring all documented local clubs that Olunga played for and who appear in his FKF player passport benefit from the player s transfer, The lanky Olunga left Kenyan champions Gor at the end of last season to begin life in Sweden where he penned a four-year deal.Earlier, the CEO had advised grass-root clubs to not only affiliate with the federation but also register their players with FKF so as to benefit from such Fifa training compensation or solidarity contribution should their players venture abroad.
