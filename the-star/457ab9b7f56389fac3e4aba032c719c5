West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo on Monday urged Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi to ditch Jubilee for Kanu if he wants to retain his seat.Lonyangapuo said Jubilee operatives are playing dirty cards behind Cheboi s back, and they intend to freeze him out of nominations. Cheboi should not dream he will receive a direct nomination from the Jubilee Party, he said.Lonyangapuo said Baringo and West Pokot are undisputed Kanu zones. He said 11 Baringo MCAs have ditched Jubilee and Cheboi should follow suit.Lonyangapuo said Cheboi and other unsuspecting leaders do not figure in Deputy President William Ruto s plans. Jubilee is not a bed of roses, he said. There are reports Ruto supports National Gambling and Betting Board director Simon Chelugui to wrest the seat from Cheboi.
