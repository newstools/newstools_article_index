It was led by Nairobi Archbishop Cardinal John NjueEmbu Catholic Diocese Bishop Paul Kariuki had asked development consultant Kithinji Kiragu, Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire and former PS Cyrus Njiru to greet the congregation but keep off politics. They went ahead to canvass.They took advantage of the thousands of worshippers who attended mass to honour Njue s 30-years of service as a bishop. He was appointed to the Vatican Secretariat for Communication by Pope Francis in July.Kiragu kicked off the campaigns by telling about 5,000 faithful he was the best placed to deliver them to Canaan . Go and pray so that we can deliver Embu from Sinai to Canaan. I am ready to lead you out of this bondage, Kiragu said.Mbarire was next and took over from where Kiragu had left.She said she will stand for governor, despite being the only woman in the race that has attracted four men.She said she is the best candidate because of her record as the Runyenjes MP. I have announced that I am seeking the seat of the governor. Consider that I am the only peson wearing a dress among these aspirants. You should vote for me, she said.When it was Njiru s turn, the narrative did not change.He said the county s top job is sensitive and demanding and thusrequires somebody with the know-how and experience in managing institutions. He said he has the experience to manage the county.He added that Embu needs a manager who is focused, honest, accountable and able to unite all the leaders.He said the best candidate should help people work together for their common goal, and not a politician who wants to solve problems politically.
