The 10 Mombasa MCAs arrested for allegedly soliciting bribes from Coca-Cola initially asked for Sh20 million to exonerate the company, a source has said.He said the MCAs reduced their demand to Sh10 million, before settling on Sh5 million. They were to receive Sh1 million on Monday when they were intercepted then arrange for the balance to be wired, the source said. The MCAs had gone to inspect Coca- Cola s factory after one of its products Dasani water was allegedly found to contain impurities. They were allegedly bribed to alter a report which found water samples to be harmful and recommended that the firm stop supplying its products to Mombasa.An insider at the assembly said the report had already been finalised and was to be tabled this week. Health Committee chairman Swaleh Baya denied both soliciting a bribe and planning to alter the report. The report is not ready yet. We are awaiting sample results from South Africa, he said. Six of the MCAs recorded statements. All 10 MCAs were released.Coca-Cola CEO Ibrahim al Khoury was unavailable for comment. A source at the Integrity Centre said EACC officers had been tracking the MCAs since the story of alleged impurities broke.
