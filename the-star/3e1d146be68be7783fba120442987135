The Sidian Bank yesterday admitted it transacted part of the Sh791 National Youth Service loot through an account held by a lawyer.The bank told the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee investigating the massive fraud that they transacted money ranging from Sh10 million to Sh50 million belonging to key suspects Josephine Kabura and John Kago Ndung u, through an account held by Ogola and Company Advocates.MD Titus Karanja said Sh40 million and Sh23 million was wired from Family Bank to its account, but the filters could pick it up as belonging to the two prime suspects, as the account was known for transacting huge amounts of money because it dealt in the land and property businesses. It was an inadvertent omission on our part not to disclose that when we appeared before this committee earlier, he said. The bank earlier said no NYS proceeds were channeled through it.
