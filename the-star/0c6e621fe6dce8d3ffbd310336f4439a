The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is investigating bribery allegations against 22 Mombasa MCAs, who yesterday went to inspect the Coca Cola Bottling Company over impurities allegedly found in a water bottle. The members of the Health Committee recorded statements following the swoop by EACC investigators.The MCAs had earlier claimed to have found pieces of cotton wool in bottles of Dasani water, and summoned the company&rsquo;s management to defend itself. Despite requests for more details by general manager Ibrahim El Khoury on Thursday, the MCAs recommended that the water section of the bottling plant in Kikambala, Kilifi county, be shut down.The Kenya Bureau of Standards visited the plant and suspended the production of Dasani water there. Regional manager Martin Nyakiamo said the suspension will remain until surveillance inspectors give the production line a clean bill of health. He had urged members of the public who discover foreign bodies in beverages to report to the committee. The MCAs yesterday went to inspect the plant and met EACC investigators on their way out.The detectives demanded to search their bags and wallets. It was not clear what they found. Mombasa EACC boss Simon Cherpka said the committee members would record statements. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give officers enough time to complete their investigations. Once they are done, we will issue a concrete press statement,&rdquo; he said. Coca Cola recalled water that was bottled between September 16 and 18. The 6,500 half-litre bottles were to be distributed at the Coast.
