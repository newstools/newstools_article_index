Leaders who engage in parrot-talk are less development oriented than quiet ones, Sospeter Ojaamong has said and placed himself in the latter category.The Busia Governor said his administration is for the people's development and that he will ensure every county grows."A good leader is the one who does his or her work quietly without attracting much attention. Those who talk much end up doing little," he said."My government has helped fund the construction of Nambale University and many other institutions across the county. We shall continue supporting education in the county."He spoke during a fundraiser at St Joseph's Musokoto Secondary School in Nambale subcounty on Saturday.Read: Ojaamong lists projects for Uhuru ahead of Busia tourAlso read: Busia county chief deserves a second term for his good work, say three politiciansOjaamong commended Nambale MP John Sakwa Bunyasi for being pivotal to the county's development."Bunyasi does his work with precision.
