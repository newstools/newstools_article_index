I wish to share with you my joy with and congratulate you, Moi University Class of 2016 on your graduation today. This is a significant milestone in your life and proof of your personal academic accomplishments. I have faith that the education you have received has helped you grow intellectually, spiritually, and personally. Please accept my sincere best wishes and hopes for you and your families.I believe you are leaving the university prepared for the next steps, which could be starting a career or continuing your studies. The graduation opens a whole new world of opportunities that may sometimes be disguised as challenges. Your education gives you a role in ensuring that our country and our children do not squander the 21st century fighting 19th and 20th century wars of our fathers and grandfathers. Our children must spend the 21st century fighting the same new battles for a brave new world as their counterparts in South Africa, South Korea, the US, China and the EU. Those are the technology battles, the battle for quality healthcare, quality education and better governance manifested in justice, fairness, equity and opportunity for all. That, I believe, is what your years in Moi University have armed you with. I encourage all of you to step out of Moi University today with confidence that your future does not depend on your name, which part of the country you come from, who your parents are or where you started in life. God s blessings to you on this day of celebration and in all of your future.
