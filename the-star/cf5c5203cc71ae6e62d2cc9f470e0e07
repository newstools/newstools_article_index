Former Kiambaa Mp Stanley Munga Githunguri has sued the National Land Commission over a disputed multi-million property in Kiambu county.In a suit filed yesterday at the Milimani Law Court, Githunguri is accusing the commission of dispossessing him the prime property by revoking his title deed without following due process.Through the law firm of Munga Kibanga, the politician claims NLC, in a decision communicated to him on August 15, 2016 took away his ownership right of the Tassia Coffee Estate without according him an opportunity to defend his land. "I first learnt on November 17, 2015 through the media of a notice published by the NLC purporting to review the grant over title no Nairobi block /97/1736 by the commission. On August 15, I learnt that NLC had revoked the title," said Githunguri in an affidavit.According to him, the decision by the commission breached the rules of natural justice by not affording him an opportunity to examine and interrogate the documents and materials it used to reach its finding.The former MP also says NLC violated the constitution and his rights to fair hearing as it turned itself into an investigator and fact finder."The decision revoking my title is unjust, traumatic, unreasonable, expensive, and against the spirit and the letter of the constitution and natural justice in a liberalized democracy," he says.He says there is an error of law in the purported NLC proceedings that approved the revoking of his title as they are not in conformity with the constitution."NLC is subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of this court however it has taken into account irrelevant considerations in its purported decision," he adds.He says the commission, in reaching the decision to take away Tassia Coffee Estate from him, has exhibited outright bias.Githunguri is seeking several orders among them one that will restrain NLC from proceeding with its decision, or issuing notices in relation to the piece of land until the dispute is settled.
