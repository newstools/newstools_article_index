A lawyer representing two key suspects in the National Youth Service scandal yesterday distanced himself from the saga, telling MPs police implicated him after he refused to bribe them.Patrick Ogola told the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee probing the Sh1.9 billion scandal he had not received any payments from NYS because he has never been a registered supplier.He represented suspects Ben Gethi and John Kago in purchasing properties such as houses before the scandal came into the public domain. Ogola said he handled more than Sh40 million of his clients money as a conveyancing advocate in line with the law. I am at a complete loss as to how the money sent to my account and paid out in the regular course of my business is tied to cash suspected to have been stolen from the NYS, he said.Ogola questioned why his clients companies, including Good Luck Twenty Ltd that sent him Sh10 million, have not been mentioned in the Auditor General s Special Report as a supplier who engaged in a suspicious payment with NYS.He told the session led by committee vice chairman Jackson Rop (Kipkelion West) that he has been under investigations by the Banking Fraud officers for the past one year after he was included on the list of suspects. I was harassed, intimidated, threatened and finally openly told I would need to bribe them to secure a report clearing me of any wrongdoing, Ogola said.He said several affidavits have been sworn by a Corporal Sautet making dawning allegations that cannot be substantiated despite being charged of money laundering.Ogola said police linked him to terrorism and ordered him to present himself to Anti-Terrorism Agency, where he was cleared.
