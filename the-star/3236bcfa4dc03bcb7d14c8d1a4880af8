In a major blow to politicians, President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto will lock out sitting elected leaders and aspirants from managing the Jubilee Party. Instead, they have agreed that party affairs will be run by professionals drawn from all the parties that dissolved into Jubilee. The names are expected to be announced in two weeks.Politicians are excluded in order to rule out political influence and ensure the party holds free and fair nominations without fallout.The move is expected to reassure many aspirants who feared politician officials would pull strings to nominate their favourites. Having any politician manage any part of the party will not be fair. It is important our two leaders ensure that none of us has an advantage over any candidates, Central Kenya Parliamentary Group chairman Dennis Waweru yesterday told the Star.Uhuru and Ruto's inability to agree on whether politicians should be party officials is a major reason Uhuru failed to announce the new lineup of powerful interim leaders when Jubilee was formed on September 10.The issue caused furious debate and conflict.Uhuru is understood to have argued for professionals, not politicians, but Ruto pushed for politicians, not disinterested professionalsRuto hopes to seek the presidency on a JPK (Jubilee Party of Kenya) ticket once Kenyatta finishes his second term in 2022, if he is re-elected.All interim officials will be people who do not seek elective office and are willing to serve the party wholeheartedly.Party officials interested in being nominated after elections to county assemblies, the National Assembly and the Senate will have to work for the party and be given clear targets. Otherwise, they will not be nominated.To start, all executive directors of all 11 or so former parties will be moved to Jubilee House in Pangani and will be deployed to manage different regions across the country. Executive directors of parties which have strongholds in certain areas will be moved to a different region. For example, the URP boss could be deployed anywhere but not the Rift Valley," a senior Jubilee official told the Star.The ED's will come from The National Alliance (TNA), United Republican Party (URP), United Democratic Forum (UDF), New Ford Kenya, Ford People, Grand National Union (GNU), Tip Tip, Republic Congress Party (RCP), Jubilee Alliance Party (JAP), Alliance Party of Kenya (APK) and Unity Party Of Kenya (UPK) all of which dissolved on September 8.Many aspirants have openly raised questions regarding the fairness of Jubilee Party primaries planned for February.Without political officials tilting the balance, candidates are likely to be somewhat reassured in the fairness of the process.While both the President and Deputy have repeatedly promised party s nomination will be handled by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, many aspirants have remained fearful of getting a raw deal.Both elected leaders and aspirants have been opening Jubilee Party offices across the country as they seek to influence party affairs in their regions.Narok Governor Samuel Tunai became the latest leader to open a JP office in Narok after his Kirinyaga counterpart Joseph Ndathi did the same in Kutus town.The ruling party has, however, ordered all members not to open any more offices until the party organs are fully constituted. Any Jubilee office that is being opened by a person other than the employees of Jubilee is not official because it has not been sanctioned, said David Murathe, Jubilee s active vice chairman.The Pangani-based party is also expected to announce its new party structure within two weeks.After the announcement, regional chiefs will be tasked to start massive party recruitment for two weeks starting on November 1. The proposed party structure has 31 positions both at the national and county levels. At the national level, the party will have 21 officials. Apart from the leader and deputy, Uhuru and Ruto, the other officials will be party chairman and three deputies, secretary general and three deputies, treasurer and three deputies, organising secretary and three deputies, youth leader, national women's leader and leader of persons living with disabilities. At the county level, the party will have officials in each county. They will be chairman; three deputy branch chairpersons in charge of operations, programmes and strategy; branch secretary and three deputies, branch treasurer and three deputies, branch organising secretary and three deputies, county youth leader, county women's leader and county persons living with disabilities leader. The Acting party officials are also developing rules for nominations, which previously have turned chaotic, leading to fallings out and bitterness.The JP constitution also provides for 47 county governing boards with immense powers in issues such as discipline. The boards will be set up by December. Some party members are concerned, however, that these boards could influence operations of the executive teams, if their roles are not strictly defined and differentiated.Party insiders are worried about the possibility that two or more powerful opponents at the county level could hold the board to ransom, particularly in primaries.
