Lawyer Cliff Ombeta has said representing accused persons in court is every Kenyan's constitutional right.Ombeta was responding to claims he defied a lawyers' agreement to strike over the death of counterpart Willie Kimani, his client and a taxi driver."The LSK chairman did not consult some lawyers. Lawyers are feeling sad... They should think with their heads not their hearts," he told the Star on phone on Tuesday.Police officers are being investigated over the death of Kimani, client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri whose bodies were found in a river.The officers are Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Chebulet, Silvia Wanjiku and Leornard Maina.Ombeta said he is obligated as a lawyer to represent them in court. "I should be there whenever needed. What can I do when they come to me? should I turn them away? They are also Kenyans and they need my help," he said.But the lawyer noted that he stands in solidarity with his colleagues in their strike against extrajudicial killings.Ombeta noted he does not agree with the killing of innocent people by police. AG Githu Muigai said the killers will not be tolerated and assigned four senior prosecutors to the case.Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said police officers and others implicated in crimes will, without a doubt, face the law.More than 30 local and international human rights groups and lawyers took to the streets to protest the killing of Kimani, a human rights lawyer and the two others.Demonstrations took place on Monday at Freedom Corner in Nairobi, Mombasa law courts, Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in Kisumu and Railways Grounds in Nakuru.A postmortem revealed the three died after taking hits to their heads.More on this: Autopsy report reveals lawyer Willie Kimani was beaten, then strangledThe officers believed to be behind the attacks have been detained 14 days pending investigations.Magistrates joined lawyers in the protests by way of a go-slow. Their boycott is expected to continue until Friday.The judiciary has assured support for fast and conclusive investigations into the deaths.Judiciary registrar Anne Amadi asked protesters to exercise discretion in the matter.
