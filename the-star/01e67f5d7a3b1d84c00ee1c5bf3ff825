Cord co-principal Raila Odinga has criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta for signing the Community Land Bill into law, denying the county governments powers over community land.He spoke at Mghange, Werugha and Wundanyi in public rallies during his second day of his Coast tour. Raila said Cord will go to court to ensure the law is amended.The opposition chief said Taita Taveta county will suffer the most because 62 per cent of its total land is the Tsavo National Park, while 25 per cent is ranches. This means 87 per cent of the total land in Taita Taveta will be in the hands of the national government. This is unacceptable, Raila said.He said the national park does not directly benefit residents. The Jubilee government values wildlife more than its people. Taita Taveta people have been killed by wildlife and their property destroyed, but the government has not paid them a penny as compensation, he said.Governor John Mruttu said he fears ranches in the county may be taken over by outsiders. The Cabinet Secretary, who is in Nairobi, has powers to renew the leases. When they are issued, we shall not be aware and this is dangerous, he said.Raila said if Cord wins the election, he will ensure the counties get 45 per cent of the national government revenue share, unlike the current 15 per cent. Governors are having problems pushing for development because the money from the national government ends up paying salaries alone. That means little development will be achieved, he said.Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said next week they will compel the government to table the Truth Justice and Reconcilliation Commission report. No TJRC report, no business in Parliament next week. We want to know those mentioned in the report for murder and land-grabbing, among other injustices, he said.
