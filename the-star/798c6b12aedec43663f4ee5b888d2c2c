A senior parastatal employee in Kitale town was on Friday charged with defiling a child after human rights organisations protested his release from custody. A court was told Burmen Muneria, who employed the 14-year-old girl s father as a caretaker, defiled her several times and impregnated her. He denied the charges and was released on Sh300,000 bond by chief magistrate Valentine Wandera. The case will be mentioned on October 19. Milimani chief Sylvester Momanyi said Muneria was making frantic efforts with the girl s father, a widower, to settle the matter out of court. We received information that the accused planned to defeat justice after he was released on bail, Momanyi said . Human rights activists were planning demonstrations in the town to demand justice for the girl, a form one student. Trans Nzoia Women s Caucus director Immaculate Shamala said they will ensure rapists face the law.
