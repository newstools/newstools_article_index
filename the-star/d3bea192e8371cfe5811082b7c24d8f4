MPs resume sittings today for the third part of the fourth session. The legislators have been on a one-month recess. They will have sittings for the next few weeks before proceeding on another recess from October 28 to November 7. After the 10-day break, they will resume sittings before taking a longer vacation from December 2 to February 6. The final sittings will take place from February 7. Top of the agenda is to set up and approve the long-awaited selection panel for new IEBC bosses. The approval of a nine-member select committee comprising five nominees by religious organisations and four from the Parliamentary Service Commission will set the ball rolling to pick new commissioners. Religious organisations have nominated their representatives to the panel, among them the National Council of Churches of Kenya secretary general Peter Karanja.
