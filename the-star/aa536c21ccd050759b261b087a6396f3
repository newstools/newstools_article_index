Residents of Kandara in Murang a have petitioned the county assembly to block renewal of Delmonte s lease.They want the county to ensure the fruits processing company cedes part of its 30,000 acres for public use. It has operated in the county for more than 50 years.Del Monte grows premium quality foods, processes pineapples and makes fruit juices.It is Kenya s largest exporter of the products and is also a subsidiary of Fresh Del Monte Produce, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange with a value of about $2 billion (Sh210.2 billion).Residents also demand the company s land be declared public after its lease expires in 2019.Led by Kamau Waruthi, residents in the Kandara Initiative Caucus said the firm has done little to help locals. The company has been in constant conflicts with the public, Kamau said.The company has been in operation since 1965 and is one of the largest exporters of canned fruits. Delmonte s estimated annual revenue is Sh4.5 billion, with a processing capacity of 1,500 tonnes of pineapples daily.The petition was presented to the assembly on Monday. We demand the company gives up part of its land before seeking renewal of its lease, they said.They asked the county assembly to discuss their petition and present it to the National Land Commission for consideration.The petition says Murang a county should receive at least 6,000 acres from the company to establish hospitals, higher learning institutions and industrial parks, before lease renewal. The company employes 7,000, mostly non-locals, residents say. In September last year, Del Monte Kenya sued the Murang a government for declining to extend the leases for its pineapple plantations in Thika town.In its court documents, the court said on October 1, 2012, it made the requisite applications for the extension of various leases to the local authority in Murang a and Kiambu, where it has land.It said despite complying with the statutory procedure, the two county governments failed to issue the letters of no objection for extension of the leasehold terms.Instead, the Murang a government requested Del Monte to demarcate and allocate to them at least 1,500 acres on the Thika-Kenol highway for public use .Del Monte said the request was unconstitutional and illegal as the county has no basis to make such demands. MD Stergios Gkaliamoutsas said Murang a has delayed and frustrated the lease extension process.
