A Sh1.8 billion project will end the perennial water shortage in Siaya town and its environs, Siaya water managing director Julius Nyadiango has said. The project is being tested by engineers before it is handed over to the county government. It will supply water to Siaya, Gem and Bondo subcounties.Speaking in his office on Wednesday, Nyadiango said they are testing to find if the connection can allow the flow of water by gravity from Ndanu Falls in Yala town to Nyamninia, up to Siaya. He said the supply is expected to increase in January.Nyadiango said the project, funded by the African Development Bank, will be complete in December to address domestic, sewerage and industrial needs.
