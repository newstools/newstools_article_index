Six Jubilee leaders on Saturday accused Cord of stalling and planning to derail the yet-to-begin IEBC talks.Led by Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki, the leaders said the opposition wants to ensure the talks collapse. Their purpose is the next general elections and force a coalition government, they said.The MPs included Jamleck Kamau (Kigumo), Alice Wahome (Kandara), Kamande Mwangi (Maragua) Wachira Karani (Laikipia West) and Nderitu Waweru (Ndaragwa). They said Cord is yet to present its final dialogue team, however, it was the one that prompted Jubilee to name its team.The legislators said they will not allow the process to deviate from the agenda of reforming the IEBC.They said the opposition s calls for the IEBC dissolution are not genuine. The process should be expedited to ensure we have sufficient time to prepare for the next elections, Kindiki said.Kindiki added the Jubilee leadership believes the elections must be held as scheduled. Kamande and Wahome reiterated this.The senator said they are ready to negotiate, but accused Cord of hatching plans to sabotage dialogue. We are ready to defeat Cord in the next elections. If we defeated them last time, when both the President and his deputy were dealing with the ICC cases, what about now when they are both free? Kindiki asked.Kamau said Jubilee has put in place measures to ensure the President is reelected and DP William Ruto propelled to power in 2022.The Kigumo MP said the opposition has sensed defeat and is looking for ways to be part of the government.The leaders spoke at Kenol, Murang a, during a fundraiser for a form-three student, Samuel Njihia, from Mugumo-Ini Secondary School.
