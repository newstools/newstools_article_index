The politics of salivating and meat eating have dominated discussions since the burial of Maasai leader William ole Ntimama. While Jubilee supporters have been delighted that their man President Uhuru Kenyatta had the last laugh and put opposition leader Raila Odinga in his place, ODM supporters are not talking the well-aimed barb lying down. They have warned Jubilee to expect fireworks when Baba returns from Germany.********A certain image-obsessed Kenyan-Asian businessman has been invited to attend a forthcoming conference in New York. However, our little bird has whispered that his parade during the UN General Assembly next week may get rained on - badly. Our moles suggest that the US authorities are seeking to question the tycoon about his extortion of American investors in Kenya. And like the story of Icarus, it s time to heed his father s warnings: The wax is beginning to melt! ************An MP from Western is a worried person. Reason? His leaders have "orphaned" him by dissolving his party and joining President Uhuru Kenyatta's the Jubilee Party. The first-term MP is afraid of associating himself with JP because he believes the party will be a hard sell in his constituency, where ODM enjoys massive support. Corridors is told he is not sure if his voters will buy into JP's ideologies to defend his seat that has attracted many contestants because his leaders in 2013 convinced voters their party was to decide who was to form the government between former Prime Minister Raila Odinga's Cord and the then Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition. The distressed legislator still wonders what drove his party leaders into the JP merger, yet they had earlier maintained they won't dissolve the party. It is said the MP is only half-heartedly supporting the merger to please his deep-pocketed bosses as he weighs other options, including running as an independent to ensure he returns to the House after next year's polls. *********Corridors has it that an MP from Bungoma county has been working behind the scenes to ensure he gets all the licenses that the late slain businessman Jacob Juma had. Those in the know say that the man wants to inherit all the multimillion-shilling business empire Juma controlled. It's said Juma helped him clinch his parliamentary seat and that it's now time he took over the businesses - to advance his economic and a political career jumpstarted by Juma.
