IEBC commissioners have agreed to leave office upon the swearing in of new commissioners "to avoid a power vacuum and a consequent constitutional crisis".State House Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua reported this on Friday saying the talks were guided by the need to strike a balance.Kinyua said they considered public interest, legal and constitutional demands, a contract of appointment for each commissioner and the guidance of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission."The process was not geared towards any party emerging as the winner but as an objective endeavour towards securing a dignified vacation from office," he said.He noted this was in line with the unanimous decision by Parliament when the matter was discussed.Read: IEBC commissioners agree to exit but want 'dignified' pay dealKinyua further said the unanimous decision was reached under guidance by the report by the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee, Election Laws Amendment Act 2016 and the judgement on what is a legally constituted commission.The Head of Public Service declined to reveal what each IEBC commissioner will take home, saying this remains a highly guarded secret for the sake of the "privacy and security of the commissioners". As we all know salaries are not matters to be discussed in public, so we would not want to put the lives of these men and women in danger by saying how much they will be paid, he said.The golden handshake required to send the nine commissioners home will cost the taxpayer Sh164 million.According to Star calculations, IEBC Chairman Issack Hassan is likely to take home Sh33.1 million, including the Sh12.9 million he would have earned from November this year to November 2017.Having served five years, he is also entitled to Sh20.1 million gratuity, calculated as 31 per cent of the annual salary for each year served.IEBC vice chair Lilian Mahiri-Zaja is to receive Sh27.3 million, including Sh10.7 million salary and Sh16.3 million gratuity.The other seven IEBC commissioners are to take home Sh22.2 million each Sh8.7 million as forfeited salary and Sh13.4 million gratuity.The government will spend part of the Sh5 billion Emergency Fund to pay off the commissioners, Treasury secretary Henry Rotich said.Treasury PS Kamau Thugge said the commissioners will know how much they will get on Monday as the calculations will be done over the weekend, considering four broad areas.These are the unexpired contracts for each of the commissioners, a gratuity of 31 per cent for the terms each of them served, accumulated unpaid leave and exgracier. The PS said all these terms fall within the Employment Act.Read: IEBC won t exit just yet as pay talks go onAlso read: IEBC, state reps start talks on exit package for commissionersHassan said they concurred with decisions of today's negotiations and expressed gratitude for being allowed to oversee the transition process. We reiterate our position that the current commissioners are not a stumbling block in preparation of the coming general election, said Hassan, adding the speedy outcome of the negotiations was evidence of that commitment.The chairman urged concerned agencies to expedite the process of recruiting commissioners to forestall the extended period of notice and ensure public interest and parliamentary intent are fulfilled without delay.A new commission is by law supposed to be in office at least six months before a general election is held.The electoral body earlier stood its ground on the August 8, 2017 polling date, saying preparations will have been completed by then.
