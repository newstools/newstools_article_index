The Kenya Revenue Authority yesterday seized two Range Rover cars at the Port of Mombasa valued at more than Sh24 million in the latest bust of a tax evasion syndicate.The cars were hidden in a 40-foot container from the United Kingdom, together with two cheaper cars a Toyota Corolla and a Peugeot.KRA regional manager Nicholas Kinoti said the vehicles were registered as destined for Uganda.The consignment had been declared as containing bicycles, which were also part of the cargo.Kinoti said the lost taxes would have amounted to more than Sh15 million.A Ugandan national identified as Andrew Kagambo is being sought over the attempted smuggling.Kinoti said the container arrived at Mombasa on September 5. We are conducting investigations involving different agencies with the aim of apprehending individuals behind the smuggling of containers. These are well-coordinated cartels that require collaboration among nations to arrest them, he said.Kinoti said the UK government is working with Kenyan authorities to stop the cartels.This comes a few months after President Uhuru Kenyatta instructed IG Joseph Boinnet to eliminate cartels operating at the port.KRA has in recent months also seized huge consignments of sugar imported illegally, and cars concealed as cheaper cargo to evade tax.
