Maasai leaders from Narok and Kajiado counties have threatened to ditch ODM citing the harassment of Nairobi assembly Speaker Alex Magelo.The leaders said they will support President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party if Magelo is removed from office.One of the community leaders, who spoke to the Star on condition of anonymity, said it was sad that ODM ward representatives sponsored the motion to remove Magelo from the office. It is totally unacceptable for Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok to lead the process of impeaching Magelo [yet] ODM members voted for him in 2013, he said on Sunday.The leader added if the MCAs does not withdraw his motion, the Maasai community will leave ODM and support the Jubilee government in 2017. The community has supported the party since its inception in 2007 and ODM party leader Raila Odinga has enjoyed massive support across Maasailand," he noted."It is not in order for an ODM member to front the removal of the Speaker who happens to come from the [Maa community]."He said the Speaker has been a pillar in the community, having ensured the rights of community members have been protected.More on this: Raila s wish is to unite Maasais against forces of injustice - Rosemary OdingaThe source asked Raila to intervene saying the move clearly indicated that the party has continued to marginalise the community. We are aware they planning to use their tyranny of numbers to remove the Speaker and if they make good their threat, they should forget our votes because we will ensure Uhuru is re-elected and the Cord leader defeated, he said.He added that the pending impeachment has also made the community consider supporting Jubilee candidate Jonathan Koroine in the Mosiro by-election slated for October 26. If ODM will not play its cards well it will find it hard to recapture the seat. We had faith in ODM but things are now moving in the opposite direction, he said.Read: We will support Jubilee in 2017, Maasai leaders tell UhuruAnalysts believe the motion for Magelo's impeachment will raise tension within ODM and Cord.
