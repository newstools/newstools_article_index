Chama Cha Mashinani is set to roll out nationwide recruitment early in October as part of efforts to grow its support base across the country.The decision to recruit members came after the National Executive Committee approved the plan in a Nairobi meeting on Tuesday.Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto told the Star on Thursday that the listing of members will ensure his party has a "national feeling"."As CCM, we will traverse every corner of this country to popularise our ideals and tell Kenyans that ours is a different story," Rutto said.The Governor opposed the merger of parties affiliated to Jubilee under the leadership of President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.He said he will defend his seat in 2017 through the CCM party, following National Assembly deputy speaker Joyce Laboso's declaration of interest in vying against him on a Jubilee ticket.Read: Governor Rutto s 2017 game plan Rutto said some of his colleagues across the political divide have shown interest to joining CCM but did not reveal their identities."The governors fear they may be rigged out of their parties.
