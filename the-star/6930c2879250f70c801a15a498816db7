The stalemate over the doctors strike in Nairobi seems to be far from over after medics rejected the county s one-month salary offer.The county yesterday disbursed Sh3.9 million to the bank accounts of 36 medics.Doctors went on strike on September 11 demanding six months salary. They also protested against delayed promotions and the county s failure to remit their NHIF deductions since January. Health executive Bernard Muia told the assembly Health committee the arrears for five months will be paid with September salaries. As a sign of good will and to show we are addressing the issues, we have paid the 36 doctors and I ask them [doctors] to bear with us, he said yesterday.Muia said the doctors had not been paid because they did not have appointment letters.But Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union branch secretary general Thuranira Kaugiria said doctors will not call off their strike until their demands are addressed. We have not seen even a cent in our accounts. Unless it has just come in now. Even then, we are not sure if the remaining salary will be paid. In any case, salary is not the only issue we raised, he said.Kaugiria said the county has been taking doctors round in circles since October last year when the union first issued the strike notice. Muia said 82 doctors will receive promotion letters by tomorrow, and the remaining medics will get theirs in 21 days.The committee accused the office of the county secretary and the Public Service Management Board of responding to doctors demands in a casual manner. We invited the county secretary here because he is the one in charge of technocrats and public service, but he failed to turn up, committee member Karen Wanjiku said.
