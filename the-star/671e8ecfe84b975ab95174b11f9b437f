Located in a serene location in Mweiga along the Nyeri-Nyahururu road, is the Giraffe Ark Game Lodge. It is 36 kilometers from Nyeri town and 180 kilometers from Nairobi. According to the proprietor Peter Mahu, the lodge offers beautiful, spacious and well furnished rooms. ''All rooms have balconies with an exquisite view of Mount Kenya, and comes with all the latest amenities including premium cable." Mahu says.I ask him about conference facilities as this has been a selling point for many hotels. All conference needs are catered for including WiFi, flip charts, writing pads and projector services . Mahu says. But you must try out their restaurant. The chefs out do themselves creating sumptuous dishes incorporating European, Western and local cuisines. Food times are not to be missed. For the more adventurous type for whom a reading a book on the lawns would not cut it, the lodge further offers horse riding, chess on a gigantic chess board (a must see), game drives, hiking, cycling among others.An interesting aspect about the lodge is that you can be a fractional owner. One is entitled to buy a minimum of one week's shares. Then the customer selects which week they want to go to the lodge with their family and thats it. Mahu says a week reservation starts from Sh750,000 depending on the type of room you want.
