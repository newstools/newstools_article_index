The absence of host MP David Ochieng at the burial of soccer legend James Siang a in Ugenya raised many questions. But one of Ochieng s aides said he was at his brother-in-law s funeral.At Siang a s burial on Saturday, ODM leader Raila Odinga reconciled with Funyula MP Paul Otuoma. Otuoma had earlier resigned as ODM national vice chairman and was said to have left the party, a claim he denied.Others at the burial were Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, Homa Bay woman representative Gladys Wanga, MPs Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) and George Oner (Rangwe), and Ugenya MP hopeful Francis Owino. Questions on Ochieng s whereabouts were rife at the funeral of the former Harambee Stars assistant coach. Ochieng s aide said the MP condoled with Siang a s family on Friday, knowing he could not attend his funeral and that of his sister s husband at the same time.Previously, Ochieng has been accused by some ODM members of not adhering to the party policies. But he has always insisted he is a staunch ODM supporter who believes in party policies and ideology.
