Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi has fake academic papers, an investigation done by EACC has revealed.In the report seen by the Star on Thursday, EACC says Sudi presented forged certificates to the electoral commission as he sought nomination in the 2013 general elections.The commission says Sudi's Diploma Certificate in Business Management and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education certificate were forged.According to the document, investigations had further revealed that the MP made a false declaration under oath through a self-declaration form to IEBC."The MP uttered the said forged documents to IEBC and EACC with intentions to deceive the two commissions," the report reads.A report was compelled and forwarded to the DPP on June 17, 2016 recommending that the MP be charged with three counts of forgery contrary to section 349 as read with section 345 of the penal code.Two counts of providing a false information contrary to Section 46(1)(d) as read with Section 46(2) at the Leadership and Integrity Act and making a false statuary declaration contrary to Section 11 of the Oaths and Statuary declarations.The document shows the DPP has accepted the report for prosecution.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission had received information that the MP did not posses the requisite academic qualifications in 2015 and thus decided to investigate the matter.According to the report, it had been suspected that Sudi forged certificates and submitted a false declaration in the past elections.Our efforts to get the MP to comment on the matter were futile as he told the Star on phone that he wans't in a position to immediately comment on the matter.But he did not dispute the EACC report.
