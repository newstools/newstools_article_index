We arrived at the Hyena Dam early on a Sunday afternoon and parked our vehicle, as we often do when watching birds. Suddenly, a movement on the edge of the dam caught my eye. Wow! An African skimmer sat calmly very close to us. A very rare sighting of a visiting species. I almost could not believe it.As we sat and observed, the skimmer took off on several occasions. It low-swooped over the water and skimmed the surface. Skimmers beaks are amazingly created with a longer lower scissor-like mandible. This is designed for sensing and catching mostly fish as it skims over the surface of water, mainly at dawn and dusk, when fish are feeding.African skimmers fly in lines over calm waters and dip their lower mandibles in the water to feed. When the mandible touches a fish, the skimmer snaps its mouth shut. When watching birds, it is always useful to have a good pair of binoculars, and if possible, a good camera.A bird identification book for East African species is also useful. The park has over 500 species of birds at certain times. Some of them, like the bee eaters, have beautiful colours. Others include Kingfishers, Narina Trogon, Bush Shrikes, Grey Crowned Cranes, Saddle Billed storks and various ducks.It s always a joy to see birds when driving in the park. God has created so such amazing diversity. So when you visit with the attitude of bird watching , all too often, the larger species like rhino, buffalo and even lions just get in the way! The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00. For more information on the park, you can link to www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook.
