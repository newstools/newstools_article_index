The fully-dressed skeletal remains of an adult man were found inside the home of a blind woman, whose home was so full of trash, one officer said it looked like "a garbage truck had dumped its load".Elderly Brooklyn woman Rita Wolfensohn was found living with the skeletal remains of her son earlier this month. It is possible she was living with the corpse for as many as 20 years, the New York Post reported. Relatives were taking Wolfensohn to the hospital when the son's remains were found. Wolfensohn's sister-in-law Josette Buchman found a "completely intact" skeleton wearing jeans, socks and a shirt in a second-floor bedroom. She said the skeleton was on its back on a mattress on the floor, according to the Post. A law enforcement officer told the Post the home was like "some reverse 'Psycho' scene". After an investigation into the home, officials believe Wolfensohn most likely didn't know she was living with her son's remains. The room the body was in was filled with garbage and cobwebs. Officers said it smelled of rotting food but there was not an odour of rotting flesh. Police said Wolfensohn believed her son had moved out. Wolfensohn's brother and sister-in-law Joseph Buchman and Josette said their sister is now living in an assisted-living facility. The remains of the son haven't been officially identified but police believe it is Wolfensohn's son. The woman had two children - a son who died in 2003 at age 38. Her other son Louis, who would have been almost 50, has not been seen in 20 years.
