Taxi-hailing companies are increasingly introducing new products and incentives in a bid to grow their market share in the highly competitive segment. Mondo Ride is the latest to join the fray with introduction of "Happy Hour" coming in the wake of reduction in charges to Sh3 per minute and Sh35 per kilometre. The new incentive will mean no price escalation for the customers during peak travel hours. "We will thus ensure that crisscrossing across the city is hassle-free and enjoyable. With our comprehensive services and the introduction of Happy Hours, we intend to delight customers," Mondo Ride global CEO Troels Anderson said yesterday. Since the introduction of Safaricom's Little cabs, which saw dominant Uber slashing its prices by 35 per cent, raging price wars among the different taxi-hailing services has been witnessed as companies strive to achieve market dominance.
