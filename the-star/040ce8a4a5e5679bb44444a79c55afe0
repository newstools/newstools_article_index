Jubilee is diverting public money and using it instead to bribe leaders to join JP and deliver votes for the party next year, ANC leaders in Kakamega have said.They complained to the press yesterday at Makunga market about bad roads and failing industry, which they blamed on Jubilee s largesse with the taxpayers money.They were Western region ANC chairman David Malala, Kakamega county ANC chairman Julius Arunga and Mayiakalo MCA Cleophas Malala. Despite several county MPs declaring their stand to work with Jubilee, Kakamega is still faced with dilapidated roads, poor infrastructure and collapsing industries. What Jubilee is doing is giving false promises, which have been going on since 2013 when President Uhuru Kenyatta came to power, Malala said.The leaders urged the Luhya to support Musalia Mudavadi s presidential bid, as he has emerged as the region s flagbearer .
