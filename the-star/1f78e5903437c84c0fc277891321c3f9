Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi makes a "more serious" presidential candidate than Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula, Wycliffe Oparanya has said.Oparanya, who is Kakamega Governor, said Wetang'ula was not serious as he only campaigns in Kakamega and Bungoma counties before retiring to clubs .He added that he would vote for the Amani National Congress leader, given the option of the two.But the Governor said Mudavadi should work with Cord leader Raila Odinga for the 2017 general election and try his luck for the top seat in 2022.Oparanya said the next presidential election will be a two-horse race between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. If a Luhya wants to be president under the new constitution, we must work closely with other communities, he said.The Governor added that Luhya leaders who joined Jubilee will lose their seats at the next general election.He said they were unable to sell the party in Western because the regime ignored its development as residents did not vote for it in 2013.Oparanya issued the remarks at Magale polytechnic in Shinyalu on Thursday, following Mudavadi's revelation of the formation of a super alliance with Cord leader Raila Odinga.The aim is to create a force strong enough to get President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party out of power.
