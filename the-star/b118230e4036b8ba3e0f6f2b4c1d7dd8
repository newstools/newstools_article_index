Fighting has broken out in Tana, Barambati, Makadakal and Belgish, heightening tension and displacing hundreds of families.Five people were killed on Friday and Saturday, livestock stolen and property worth of millions of shillings destroyed. On Saturday, Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye, in whose constituency some of the fighting took place, said the names of the aggressors from both sides have forwarded to security agencies but no action has been taken.Head of the Thursday delegation Abdullahi Omar Mashid yesterday distributed sugar, rice, drinking water, wheat flour, maize flour, cooking oil to displaced people at Banane. He said the county government has put in place a system with the Kenya Red Cross to help the displaced families. He said the area is expecting an upsurge in the number of displaced people. Lagdera administrator Hud Rashid praised the Garbatula security team for responding quickly to prevent retaliatory attacks. He called for calm ahead of the peace meeting and urged the warring parties to give the mediation a chance.
