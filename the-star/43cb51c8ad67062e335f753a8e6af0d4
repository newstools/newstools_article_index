Is it not amazing that after all these years of Europeans preaching to us about tribalism and its devastating effects on our politics, we now find the UK has much the same broad tribal voting patterns?Back in early 2008, at the time when fierce (and ultimately tragic) controversy still raged about whether or not President Mwai Kibaki had won reelection, I read an article by an influential development economist touching on this very issue.That writer expressed his amazement that someone like Kibaki should either have lost that election, or won it very narrowly, when he had taken over a country in deep economic stagnation and miraculously raised it to an eventual seven per cent annual economic growth.The election seemed to cast doubt on the widely-held consensus at the time that what Africa needed most and what African voters desperately wanted was leaders who could drive their nations towards prosperity.This perspective coincided with my own thinking at the time. I had in late 2007 argued with a friend that it would be madness for the electorate to dump the President when it was not clear that the opposition had anyone in its ranks who could guide Kenya s return to prosperity with the same expertise.But my friend who did not disagree with me at all concerning Kibaki s sterling management of the economy insisted that Kibaki had failed to create an inclusive government; that Kibaki s Central Kenya elite had lost touch with the regional grassroots in key vote blocs that had propelled them to power in 2002; and that the leaders from these other regions had now united to ensure Kibaki s defeat.Well, over the weekend, I read many of the analyses pouring out following the Brexit referendum in the UK, which has initiated the process of Britain leaving the European Union: a decision which some commentators have defined as economic suicide .Whether you accept that assessment or not, the consequences seen thus far make it clear that a majority of the British voted against their economic interests. And this is what made me think of Kibaki and the 2007 general election in Kenya. For whether you liked Kibaki or not, you have to admit over 50 per cent of Kenyans in 2007 voted against their national economic interests in refusing to support him in that election.In short, the voting patterns in Britain just a week ago, as in Kenya back in 2007 clearly revealed that identity politics has far greater force than any arguments about what would be good for the economy, and what might not be as good.And it is difficult not to be amused when you read that A Financial Times chart showing that the Leave vote was strongest in the parts of Britain that are the most economically dependent on the European Union was widely circulated online. But it goes well beyond identity politics. Some have declared that they detect racism in that vote. That may be so, but a good number of those whom the Leave campaign stigmatised in their successful effort are not the Africans or the Syrians, risking their lives in leaky boats in their attempts to reach the European mainland.Apparently, there is just as much resentment of Eastern Europeans, who have taken advantage of the European Union s open borders policy, to seek employment in the UK. Now in Kenya we have a word for a situation in which someone resents and stigmatizes people of the same skin colour, who speak a different language. We call it tribalism.And is it not amazing that after all these years of Europeans preaching to us about our (admittedly highly toxic) tribalism and its devastating effects on our politics, we now find that the UK has much the same broad tribal voting patterns.That, when it came to a vote that really mattered, their ancient tribal affiliations came to the fore, with two tribes (the Welsh and the English) largely voting to leave the EU, while two others (the Scots and the Irish) voted to remain in the EU? Indeed the rural English appear to resent outsiders being settled in their ancestral land just as much as many Kenyan rural tribesmen do. The only real difference and what we should learn from them is that our people are easily moved to violence, while the Brits are not.In brexit, the brits voted against their economic interests just as the more than 50% of kenyans who did not vote for kibaki in 2007 did
