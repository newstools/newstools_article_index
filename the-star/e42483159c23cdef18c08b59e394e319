Shafik Batambuze scored a 69th minute goal as theTusker edged Posta Rangers 2-1 in the last quarter-final of the GOtv Shield matches yesterday at the Thika sub-county Stadium to book a date with KCB in the semi-finals.Kariobangi Sharks will play Ulinzi Stars in the other semi-final. Humphrey Mieno broke the deadlock after 21 minutes with a stunner from the edge of the box before Timothy Otieno struck back at the stroke of halftime in an end-to -end affair but Batambuze had the last say as he slotted home from a free kick outside the 18-yard box after Joackins Atudo had been sent off for a second bookable offence following a foul on Allan Wanga.Otieno had the first chance at goal on the 14th minute but failed to capitalise on a James Situma blunder, losing the ball in the process with Titus Achesa and Duncan Otieno unable to utilize the re-bound.Two minutes later, Simon Mbugua fouled Allan Wanga outside the area but Mieno s free kick was easily picked by Patrick Matasi. In the 21st minute, George Mandela beat his marker Joseph Mbugi on the left channel before finding Wanga, who was well placed in the box but the Kenyan international lost his footing though Atudo fluffed his clearance with the ball falling on Mieno s path and he unleashed a stunner into the top corner.Likono s 32nd minute attempt was well handled by David Okello as the mailmen pushed for an equaliser through Collins Neto and Otieno. Duncan Otieno and Likono played the key roles in creating the chances from the midfield. Wanga had a penalty appeal brushed aside on the 41st minute by centre referee Raphael Nduati after he went down following a tackle by Atudo in the area.A minute to the break, one of Otieno s runs in the box paid off with a leveler after the Tusker backline failed to clear the danger from a Posta attack.The brewers looked an even better composed side in the second half, pressing on their opponents. Before they were reduced to ten men, Posta had wasted point blank chance from Otieno. Soon after, Atudo for the second time in the game brought down Wanga, who was weaving his way in the box, the former being sent off as Ugandan Batambuze stepped up to convert the resultant free kick.Situma and Wahome combined well at the back to keep out Titus Achesa and substitute Cavin Odongo as Posta, who graced the 2014 final bowed out of the competition.
