South C MCA Diana Kapeen has refuted reports she has decamped ODM for the newly formed Jubilee Party.Kapeen also denied claims she is one of the MCAs behind the plans to impeach Governor Evans Kidero."First, I cannot impeach Kidero. He is my personal friend. I campaigned and voted for him in 2013," she said."And as to whether I have left ODM I want to say I have not decamped the party though I don't think if it is the party I will use in 2017. In fact, I don't think I will run for any position next year, " she said.She however blamed individuals in the county assembly of trying to push her out of the party that she had been for 10 years. The county legislator asked party leader Raila Odinga to change ODM leadership at the city assembly."It is not my wish to think of even leaving the party I love but its some people here at the Assembly pushing me out, " she said.Kapeen and her Viwandani counterpart Sam Nyangwara were reported to have quit ODM for President Kenyatta's Jubilee Party.Read: Jubilee won t make room for you, Kaluma tells ODM rebels The two ward reps attended the JP launch at the Kasarani stadium on September 10.Nyang'wara has been collecting signatures to impeach Kidero.
