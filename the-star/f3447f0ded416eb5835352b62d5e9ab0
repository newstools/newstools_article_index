DESPITE everything else, Willy Mutunga will always be credited for giving the Judiciary a human face. He worked hard to demystify the institution. He made it friendly to the people and largely opened it up to public scrutiny.There is apprehension within the corridors of justice that this major leap in taking the Judiciary forward is at the risk of being swept away if some of the candidates who are lining up to replace him get a chance to take over.Watching the applicants as they were interviewed, it was clear a majority of them espouse strange elements of conservatism that would take the Judiciary back to those terrible days were they to be appointed.And that is where we start. The next Chief Justice must be a pragmatic individual who will complete the shift in paradigm from the Old Order to a new one. He will have to lead the implementation of the constitution, not only in its letter but the spirit, too. Such a judge must be well grounded in law and the rich historical background of the process of the writing and the promulgation of the 2010 constitution.In other words, we require a lawyer at the helm of the Judiciary who combines the practical aspects of legal practice and the scholarly aspects of it: A leader, not merely an academician, who will ensure that the court process takes into account the feelings of the people.Most important, such an individual must have a deep understanding of the complexity of the Kenyan society with knowledge of why Kenyans overwhelmingly voted for the new constitution at the 2010 referendum. Kenyans wanted a clean break from the past: The past where the CJ was a Presidential appointee who used his position to serve the ruling elite, not the public.The starting point for the new CJ will be to halt the dwindling fortunes of the Supreme Court and the entire Judiciary, which has been under serious threat of late.The new Chief Justice will have to step up to the anti-corruption fight; and explore practical solutions to the challenges of the massive backlog of cases. What better place to start than the Labour and Land courts, reeling where the backlog goes back to 2009 and 2010?Mutunga s successor will need to go hand-in-hand with the kind of individual appointed DCJ, complementing the personality of the CJ and filling up his deficits.
