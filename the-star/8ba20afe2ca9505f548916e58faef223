Just what is the matter with one Joseph Njuguna, the man who filed a petition with the Judicial Service Commission for the removal from office of the Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi? Well, Corridors has it that despite endless reminders by JSC Registrar Fridah Mokaya, the man has gone quiet after he allegedly failed to submit the required evidence. Interestingly, the man cannot even be reached on phone as calls to his phone, whose number he submitted to the JSC, do not go through. What is left behind is the option of an SMS only. As if nothing bothers him, he is said not to respond to the JSC's text messages! The man filed the petition last month, but the commission has not been able to proceed because he has not been able to provided the required information on which the petition is anchored.******************Corridors of Power wonders why Deputy President William Ruto, on all the Jubilee Party billboards, faces away from the camera, while President Uhuru Kenyatta faces the camera and every viewer. What happened here? Was it intentional on Ruto's handlers' part? Or is it intricate protocol? Perhaps it has a hidden meaning/agenda - for instance, to hide Ruto's face? ********************Are four governors in Nyanza shopping for a new political party? Well, sources whisper to Corridors that the four, who were elected on the ODM ticket, have secretly acquired certificates from a little-known political outfit. One of the said governors faces a wealthy businessman and a sitting MP. It's not clear when they want to come out in the open and declare their intentions. However, the new law will prevent the four from switching camp after nominations. For the time being, however, they seem to be praying for direct nominations.****************A city lawyer sometimes dismissively referred to by his peers as Kenya's ultimate balloon of vanity in legal circles has, it may seem, fallen on hard times. The man, according to our moles, has also fallen foul of the authorities in whose mighty name he would from time to time intimidate others. Lately, the learned friend has been beating his wife senseless. The wife, tired of being a veritable punching bag, filed for divorce, which our little bird confirms is about to be granted.
