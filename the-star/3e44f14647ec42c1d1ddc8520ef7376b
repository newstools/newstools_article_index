There is a shortage of eye-care specialists in the country, hence increasing the eye disease burden.The Health ministry s Hazel Mumbo said 250,000 people in Kenya are blind and another 750,000 suffer from low vision. It s sad we do not have the capacity to address the burden. In Nairobi, one ophthalmologist caters for 700,000 patients, Mombasa has a ratio of 1 to 450,000, 1 to 1.25 million in Western and 0 to 1 million in Turkana, he said.Mumbo said apart from the University of Nairobi and Kenya Medical Training Institute, institutions are not well-equipped to train eye specialists. There is need for other institutions to introduce training for more skilled workers. The eye doctors need to attend further training. Head of the Ophthalmic Services Unit in the ministry of Health Michael Gichangi (pictured) urged Kenyans to go for early check-up to prevent severe stages of eye diseases. We are working with diabetic patients who are suffering from leading irreversible blindness. We have noticed that early detection through the use of a new technology, which was introduced in Kenyatta National Hospital, has led to the screening of 200 diabetic patients at risk of blindness, he said.Gichangi said the NHIF insurance services can help one get eye treatment services easily. There is limited uptake of eye-care services yet they are free. Go for check-up. Parents must take their children for check-ups regularly, he said.
