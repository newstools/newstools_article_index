MPs were on Tuesday divided on whether Cord leader Raila Odinga should be investigated on claims that his firm was involved in the ailing Kenya Airways financial problem.The debate into proposed inquiry into KQ woes split the House along political lines after some Jubilee MPs demanded Raila should be probed over his company - Astral Aviation Ltd - involvement in the airline's winding up cargo handling business.National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale tabled a motion seeking an inquiry into KQ by a House Select Committee for individuals and cartels involved in its downfall held accountable.Duale raised concern the airline has lost its pride in African market and that they cannot sit and watch as it sinks.KQ last year recorded a huge loss of Sh25 billion that has affected its operations and competitive advantage over other carriers in the continent.Tiaty MP Asman Kamama said: "The Astral Aviation Ltd should be thoroughly investigated because we expect the former Prime Minister always to be like Caesars wife".He pointed out underpricing and overpricing tickets on varied routes to benefit some individuals must also be probed because it was contributing to the airline's losses.Charged Cord MPs came to Raila's defense and asked the Jubilee counterpart to focus on ways the national carrier can be revamped particularly bringing to book its former directors and business people who fleeced the airline."The biggest blame is to the government. Linking Raila to KQ problems is a plot by Duale which is nothing. In fact, if we investigate this matter, it will bite that side (Jubilee) than this side (Cord)," Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu said.He said the country should be told who the owners of Jambo Jet are, claiming they are among individuals fleecing the airline. Raila has dismissed any involvement in KQ financial woes and has threatened to sue The Standard Newspaper and its writer for defamation.Eldas MP Aden Keynan demanded that the cartels in KQ not only be "named and shamed' but also prosecuted to end further collapse of parastatals in the country.Most MPs supported that a select committee be set up to inquire into KQ woes.Read: State to overhaul KQ s board during meetingAlso read: KQ shareholders flare up at AGM, warn state against intimidation
