The people of Thailand are mourning the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, who died on Thursday aged 88.An emotional crowd held a late-night vigil in Bangkok, and black-clad crowds are now returning to the streets.The king's body will be taken to the city's Emerald Temple later on Friday. The official mourning will last a year.Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn is to be the new monarch, but has asked for a delay before taking over the role.Flags are to fly at half-mast for 30 days and the government has asked for people to wear black, and avoid "joyful events" during this period.News websites have turned their pages black and white, while tributes have been paid by leaders around the world.One person going to work in Bangkok told the Associated Press: "There is no word to explain my feeling right now.""I lost one of the most important people in my life. I feel like I haven't done enough for him. I should have done more," said Gaewkarn Fuangtong.King Bhumibol was seen as a stabilising figure in a country hit by cycles of political turmoil and coups.He was widely respected across Thailand, and thought of by many as semi-divine.He had been ill for a long time. When news of his death was announced on Thursday evening, many in the large crowds outside the hospital where he died broke down.The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Bangkok says the king was Thailand's father figure, a beacon of stability in a divided and worried country. A more uncertain era has begun, he adds.
