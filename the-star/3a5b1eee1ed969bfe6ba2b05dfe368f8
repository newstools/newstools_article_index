DP William Ruto has castigated two governors and an MP who stormed Moi University over the acting VC appointment, saying this was reckless and uncalled for.Governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet) led politicians on September 20, in trying to stop acting VC Prof Laban Ayiro from taking over from professor Richard Mibey.Ruto broke his silence on the matter on Sunday, saying: "All leaders must act responsibly when dealing with public issues. Public appointments should be made purely on merit, with those who finish top in interviews being given priority.""We should not allow anything to degenerate into an ugly situation," he added in an address to journalists at the UN General Assembly in New York, US.Read: [AUDIO] Two governors, MPs storm Moi University over new 'outsider' VC AyiroRegarding reports that candidates were being locked out on the basis of their tribes, Ruto said the institution was an equal opportunity employer and that no no one should be discriminated because of ethnicity."Nobody should be denied an opportunity in Kenya because of his religion or where he comes from," he said.The Deputy President's comments came a day after Mandago said "funny" appointments were being made at the university while he was out of the country."Nyinyi kila siku mnagonja DP akienda nje ndio mnafanya funny appointments. Mnataka kutupiganisha katika hii serikali," the Governor said in Kiswahili.This loosely translates to: "You always wait for the DP to leave the country to make funny appointments. You want to cause havoc in government."Last week, the Universities Academic Staff Union asked political leaders to stop interfering with management of universities in the country.UASU secretary at Moi University Jack Abok said the protest by the politicians amounted to serious interference with the independence of the institution.More on this: UASU tells politicians to steer clear of issues in Moi UniversityAlso read: UASU wants Moi University ex-VC to go home and Sh1bn staff deductions paidBut more than 100 MCAs from Uasin Gishu, Nandi and Trans Nzoia defended Mandago and the MPs saying their action did not amount to perpetrating tribalism.Mandago denied being tribal even as more quarters came out to condemn the protest.Read: Moi University students condemn protests by Mandago against acting VC Ayiro hiringAyiro who took over from Mibey said leaders and managers should be humble and embrace dialogue to sort out disputes.Read: Tight security as Moi University conducts 32nd graduation ceremony
