MPs will today pass a key legislation aimed at affirming their grip of National Government Constituency Development Fund.Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi, in a gazette notice, has recalled lawmakers for a special sitting today, that will also entail enacting the National Government Constituency Development Fund Bill, 2016.The Bill early, this month sailed through second reading, meaning that it awaits a question to be put today to send it to the President for assent to law, if adopted.Lawmakers had introduced and adopted a crucial amendment to the Bill to circumvent the recent court ruling denying constituencies Sh10 billion in CDF money.The High Court ordered Treasury Cabinet secretary to release not more than Sh25 billion, CDF money to constituencies for the 2016/2017 financial year locking MPs out of Sh10 billion, now in arrears.The provision opens a window for the national government to facilitate CDF projects directly through the national Treasury after the High Court blocked the Treasury from releasing part of the Sh35 billion allocated to the kitty in the current financial year.Under the proposed law, the Treasury would no longer channel funds meant for development projects identified by MPs themselves at the constituency level through line ministries, as it has been the case. The National Government may where necessary, facilitate other projects or programmes falling within the purview of the national government with funds other than specified in the law, states the amendment moved by Majority Whip Katoo Ole Metito(Kajiado South).The bill seeks to cure gaps in the initial law the High court declared unconstitutional after a case challenging the legality of the kitty.In the proposed law, MPs also removed a legal provision that allows constituencies in marginalized areas a greater share of the total CDF allocation.This means that CDF money will be shared equally among the 290 constituencies in an amendment which was moved by CDF chairman Moses Lesssonet(Eldama Ravine).
