Women supporters of Kitui Deputy Governor Peninna Malonza temporarily disrupted a burial ceremony in Kauma, Kitui West, on Saturday.They were angered when Trade executive Jonah Mwinzi read Governor Julius Malombe s condolence message.The women said Malonza should have read the message during the mass burial for five family members killed in a road accident on the Kitui -Kauma road.The driver of a van they hired to take a sick relative to hospital lost control and rammed onto a tree.When Mwinzi finished reading Malombe s message, the women moved forward and attempted to snatch the microphone.They engaged him in an altercation.The women urged Malonza to read the governor s message as they tried to wrestle the microphone from Mwinzi.Malonza, former Lands CS charity Ngilu and area MP Francis Nyenze were present.Ward administrator Peter Yaninga took away the microphone. He said the family had requested that politics be kept off the ceremony. Those who came here thinking they will use chaos to sort out political scores are at the wrong place. Let us be calm and allow this funeral to be as peaceful as possible, he said.After calm was restored, Fr Daniel Maanzo of Mutune Catholic parish took over the programme.
