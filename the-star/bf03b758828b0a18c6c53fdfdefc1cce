The National Council of NGOs has condemned the government for ignoring it in the appointment of the team that will participate in the selection of new IEBC commissioners.Chairman Stephen Cheboi said they have neither been represented nor consulted despite being a key player in advocacy."It is outrageous that the government can appoint a team to enter into negotiations on replacing IEBC commissioners, while representatives of NGOs are excluded despite their key role in the society," Cheboi told a press conference in Nairobi, on Friday. But the council noted that it will support the team that has been selected.Read: IEBC select panel taking shape as Jubilee yet to announce its representatives in 9-member teamCheboi praised IEBC chairman Issack Hassan and his team of commissioners for tendering their resignations to allow the recruitment of new commissioners."This was a good sign.
