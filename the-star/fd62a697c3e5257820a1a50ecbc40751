Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said he will back his rivals if he loses the Jubilee Party nominations in May next year. Speaking in Kiambu town, he said he expects a fair process.The nominations will be hotly contested in what seems to be a two-horse race between Kabogo and his fiercest would-be political nemesis, Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu. Aquiline Gathendu is the latest entrant in the race.Kabogo expressed confidence he will clinch the party ticket. He said Kiambu residents support him because of his development record. If another aspirant wins, I m ready to back them because it would be the will of Kiambu people. But I will bag the ticket and carry on with the development agenda I have set, Kabogo said.He said if he retains his seat, he will work together with his rivals and all leaders to develop the county and improve residents living standards. My administration has always been ready and willing to work with every right-minded leader for the well-being of our people and development. In the next five years, the doors are open for everyone willing to work with me, Kabogo said. He urged the Jubilee Party leaders to ensure the primaries are free and fair.
