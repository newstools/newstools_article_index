Migori Governor Okoth Obado has said he is not among the financiers of the Labour Party of Kenya.LPK has been acquired by Budalang i MP Ababu Namwamba, the former ODM secretary general. Obado has rebutted claims he is among those bankrolling Namwamba s outfit. I only hear through the press that Ababu has a third force, I have not seen Ababu or gone to him, Obado said.The governor said the reports are political propaganda by his rivals to attach him to Namwamba s party. He said he is in ODM.Last week on social media, Obado was linked to LPK as an option if he gets locked out during ODM primaries. But Obado said he is ready to face the seven ODM aspirants trying to unseat him.
