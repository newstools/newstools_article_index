Matano s family led by Rosemary and Caroline were present to receive the cheque on his behalf and thanked Fidelity Insurance for the support. Kenya Football Coaches Association (KEFOCA) chairman, Ricky Solomon stressed the need to have a medical cover as part of the technical bench contracts by the start of next year. We hope by next year, all the coaches will be put under mandatory medical cover to avert such cases as witnessed by Matano and other tactcians in the past, he said.The small token to the family is a show of solidarity with the family in this journey and we will keep them in prayers. We will discuss with SJAK, and Fidelity on the way forward with our coaches, as this requires thorough deliberation.
