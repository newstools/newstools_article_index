ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has not ruled out working with Raila Odinga&rsquo;s Cord in next year&rsquo;s elections.He has, however, ruled out the possibility of forming any alliance with President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s Jubilee Party.Mudavadi, who addressed the media at the party secretariat in Nairobi yesterday, reaffirmed his willingness to work with Cord once it decides who among Raila, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula should be the coalition&rsquo;s presidential flagbearer.&ldquo;I am ready to work with people who are ready to serve Kenyans. Right now, I am not having any talks with Cord until they put their house in order,&rdquo; Mudavadi said when he received back MPs who had joined Jubilee. The defection of the MPs elevates the status of ANC, which is yet to participate in an election.&ldquo;I will never negotiate with jubilee and I will never join it. ANC is the future of Kenya. It is growing day in day out and the government we will form in 2017 will be non-tribal,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.Among the MPs who joined ANC are Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale) and Alfred Sambu (Webuye East). They were elected on the UDF ticket but the party has since dissolved to form JP.Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, a key ally of Mudavadi, was also present. &ldquo;We have obeyed and trusted the advice of our voters and chosen to join other Kenyans in strengthening a party founded on the principles of democracy. We want to strengthen devolution, fight corruption and promote decent politics,&rdquo; Mudavadi said.During the run-up to the 2013 election, Mudavadi, then in UDF, was duped into signing an agreement with Uhuru and his deputy, that the two would later renege.The arrangement was to have the ANC leader as the presidential candidate under Jubilee after indications that Uhuru and his deputy may not be elected owing to the crimes against humanity charges they faced at the Hague-based International Criminal Court.Mudavadi has criticised the Jubilee merger, saying it is a ploy to take Kenya back to single-party rule. Mudavadi, who has been urging Luhyas to unite, accused Uhuru of forsaking the Constitution he swore to protect.
