Kenya Airways cabin crew downed their tools on Thursday citing poor relations with management and poor medical benefits.Sources at KQ s hangar told the Star the effects of the strike are already being felt."KQ flight 112 to Paris which is set to take off at 2300 hours will have three senior flight pursers instead of one," the source said.The pursers - who play a more senior role in cabin crew management - will assist with regular cabin duties due to the shortage of employees.This comes in the wake of a looming pilots strike at the national carrier.A cabinet meeting chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House on Thursday directed all public officers to use the national carrier while traveling outside Kenya on official duty.The move, which will be implemented under the Fly Kenya Policy, is set to support the grappling airline. Also agreed in the meeting was that the pilot's union should immediately withdraw the seven-day strike notice on grounds that it had overstepped its mandate.Transport and Infrastructure CS James Macharia said the impact of the strike would cause widespread economic and national disruption."The government would further use all the levers available under law to take action against those who defy the directive," he said.
