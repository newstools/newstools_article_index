Public institutions and government parastatals are the most notorious in breaching employment and labour laws. High Court judge Linnet Ndolo said more often than not the government is the respondent in the Employment and Labour Relations Court. We should stand out and fight impunity in courts. Government institutions are known for ignoring the law and expecting to be favoured by the courts, Ndolo said.She was addressing colleagues during the ongoing annual judges colloquium in Mombasa. Ndolo said the government "is known to throw the laws to the dogs and it is an institution where impunity resides." We find ourselves in a dilemma, how does a judge balance the rights of an employee against the Government .
