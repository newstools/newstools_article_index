Corridors has it on authority that Kenya's Third President, Mwai Kibaki, returned to the country looking much better on Saturday night. We are told the former Othaya MP landed at 10pm aboard a Kenya Airways Dreamliner and was received by family members and close confidants. Mzee Kibaki's handlers, working with national security teams, the presidency and the Foreign Affairs ministry, ensured that his return was executed with perfect and discreet coordination to guarantee the retired President and his family's privacy. Talk of managing media to zero leakage levels!************That you saw Nyali MP Cyprian Awiti with President Uhuru Kenyatta in Mombasa was no accident. We are told that ODM rebels led by Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro are fronting the first-time MP to replace flamboyant Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho. We are told Mung'aro and his team settled on Awiti, because some area church leaders back him and they believe he can get both the indigenous and the Bara (upcountry) vote. The team is now looking for Awiti's running mate, whom they will present to President Kenyatta.*************One of Nairobi's governor hopeful was on Saturday shocked when his "paid" supporters turned up and started chanting his opponent's name during the launch of the Jubilee Party. We hear the aspirant had ferried at least 1,000 of his supposed supporters, who are said to be members of the Mungiki sect into the Kasarani Stadium. The aspirant's plan was to show that he has a mass following, little knowing that one of his rivals was also working on a similar plan - with the same group. The man was overheard quarreling with his personal assistant on why his "supporters" were shouting his rival's name while wearing the T-shirts he had sponsored.************What plan does the Jubilee Party have in Kwale? We are told the party has a big headache over what to do with its long-serving member Chirau Ali Mwakere, who is interested in becoming governor. The complication has risen following the entry of ODM defector Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, who ditched the Orange Party, hoping to defend his seat on the Jubilee Party ticket.
