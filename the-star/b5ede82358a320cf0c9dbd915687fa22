The Somali community's Mombasa chapter has denied taking political stands, including who to back for president, as reported by some media.Chairman Mohamed Abdi said they were yet to decide who to support or front for the presidency and other political seats.Abdi said an individual masquerading as the group s chairman was issuing political statements which were incorrect, causing confusion.The chairman, who is also Mombasa's executive member for trade, said one Abdi Daib has been making inflammatory political statements contrary to their ideologies and beliefs.He spoke at a hotel in the county on Sunday alongside Hajir Maow and Abdinur Ali who are executive youth representatives.The three officials were reacting to an announcement on a local radio station that invited the Somali community to a Jubilee political meeting.The announcement invited community members to a meeting for political, social and cultural talk to spur unity and peace, at Jubilee Hall on October 2 from 9 am.MPs and senators of Somali origin, majority of whom are from the government side, are to attend.Daib, who is eying the Changamwe parliamentary seat on a Jubilee ticket, organised the meeting that National Assembly Majority leader Aden Duale is to chair.Sheikh Abdhur Rahim Abu Aimein will address the importance of unity and corporation from the Muslim perspective. The meeting is good but has been organised by a wrong person, Abdi said. We will attend due to the respect we hold for Duale, not because of some people."Abdi asked Daib to desist from issuing political statements on behalf of Somalis, saying they will declare their stand when the time is right.Daib did not answer calls for comment on the matter.Abdi and the two other officials will meet on Tuesday to discuss matters affecting the Somali community. Regarding security, he said Somalis living in Mombasa were work with authorities.
