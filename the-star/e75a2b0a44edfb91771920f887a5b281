A growing proportion of Kenyans with HIV are reaching undetectable viral load levels because of antiretroviral drugs, raising hopes that the epidemic may soon be brought under control.The risk of such people transmitting HIV is negligible, even if they do not use condoms.Acting director of medical services Dr Jackson Kioko said that HIV cohort studies show Kenya's viral load suppression rates are in the range of 83 per cent .This would imply Kenya has some of the highest viral suppression rates in the world better than some western countries.Read: Kenya donates Sh500m to fight HIV-Aids While those who reach viral suppression levels are not cured, the amount of HIV in the blood is extremely low and such people live longer and are less likely to pass on the virus to others."However, the suppression rates for children and adolescents are a challenge at 69 per cent and 63 per cent and we must do more in this area," Kioko said in Nairobi at the ongoing HIV conference organised by the National Aids and STIs Control Programme (Nascop).Read: Kenya gets Sh34bn for ARVs, malaria drugs At least 1.6 million Kenyans are living with HIV and the country treats 950,000 of them with ARVs.In May this year, another study led by Dr Peter Cherutich, a deputy director of medical services in the Ministry of Health, noted that 73 9 per cent of all HIV positive Kenyans on ART had viral suppression.The study, Detectable HIV Viral Load in Kenya: Data from a Population-Based Survey, showed the viral load was higher among young people and those not taking ARVs."Still, our data validate findings that treatment outcomes in low-income countries including adherence to ART and virologic suppression are commensurate to those in high-income countries," Cherutich said.Also read: Kenya winning the fight against HIV, Health CS tells UN in New York In Monday's meeting, leading Kenyan HIV researcher Prof Thumbi Ndung'u said HIV cure is not in sight and ARVs are the best option for those already infected.Prof Ndung'u is a globally respected HIV researcher currently heading HIV/TB Research at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.He said ongoing studies are unlikely to produce HIV vaccine in the next five years."We must try to treat HIV infections very early because it preserves the immune system," he said.Nascop director Dr Martin Sirengo and Dr Loise Achieng, an infectious disease specialist from the University of Nairobi, also attended the meeting.
