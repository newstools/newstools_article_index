As a workers representative in the NSSF board, we will move to court to stop EACC from interfering with the ongoing recruitment, he said.The Cotu boss said the powers of appointing the chief executive and managing trustee do not lie with the EACC, but the NSSF board.Atwoli pointed out that after the board appoints the CEO, the anti-graft agency can investigate the appointee based on his or her past record.
