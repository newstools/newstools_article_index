ODM leaders have accused Jubilee of being skewed in the registration of persons and issuance of national identity cards.National chairman John Mbadi (Suba) said there was evidence showing government agencies have facilitated mass registration of voters in certain parts of the country.Mbadi added in a statement on Sunday that some people have been excluded."The National Registration Bureau, Huduma Centres, Interior ministry and the IEBC are implementing this policy of segregation," he said."ODM demands specific explanation from [the organisations] on why they are involved in the discriminatory registration of persons and voters."He said it was wrong for the government to be involved in registration of persons, as this is not one of its roles.The Interior ministry allegedly sent a memo to church leaders and youth groups notifying them of a planned mobile ID cards and voters registration exercise.The chairman further demanded an explanation on the international community's role and position on these "very disturbing developments".He pointed out the UNDP, claiming it is known to work closely with and finance the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission."ODM will not succumb to threats and intimidation. ODM will neither tolerate nor accept the skewed and segregationist pattern that has already started with regard to preparations for 2017 elections," he said."We warn that this segregationist pattern will certainly have undesired consequences in the days ahead. ODM will reserve the right to respond to those consequences to preserve and safeguard democracy and the right of Kenyans of voting age to register as voters and cast the vote in a free and fair poll." The government has denied the opposition's claims of corruption and underhand deals concerning the August 8, 2017 general election.This includes colluding with the IEBC to rig the vote and buying opposition politicians into the freshly-launched Jubilee Party.Read: Ruto dismisses Cord on buying of supportersAlso read: Duale dismisses claims Jubilee is buying voters, calls Raila 'crybaby'But Cord leader Raila Odinga and others in the opposition continued with their onslaught, specially after Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba's resignation as ODM secretary general, and JP's harvest of many opposition politicians.In July, Raila accused the ruling coalition of using money swindled through corruption to buy some opposition leaders ahead of 2017 elections.
