Nairobi Cord MCAs plan on removing from all the assembly committees an MCA who last week tried to table an impeachment motion against the governor.A source yesterday told the Star the decision to remove Viwandani MCA Sam Nyang wara from the committees was ratified in a secret meeting at a city hotel on Sunday.The MCAs also agreed to have Viwandani residents sign a petition to recall Nyang wara for non-performance . Yesterday, majority whip David Mberia said he has written to majority leader Elias Otieno to remove Nyang wara from all the panels. There is no way an MCA elected on the ODM ticket can sponsor a motion to impeach Governor Evans Kidero, who was elected on the same ticket. That is utter nonsense, Mberia said.Nyang wara said the party leadership in the assembly is intimidating him to drop the motion. Cord, and ODM for that matter, are enjoying the majority in the house because of my vote. They should tread carefully because I have not played all my cards yet, he said.Out of the 127 MCAs, 64 were elected on the ODM and Wiper tickets, while 63 are in Jubilee. Cord chairs 15 out of the assembly s 17 committees.The Public Accounts and Public Investment committees are chaired by Jubilee MCAs. I am not fighting the party or the coalition, I am fighting an individual who has made this county look like Mumias [sugar company], Nyang wara said.He said he will table the motion again, but Cord members say they will not allow it.On Thursday, the MCAs fought over efforts to table the Kidero impeachment motion and Nyang wara was roughed up.The Jubilee and Cord MCAs came to a fistfight as some chanted Msaliti (traitor) and Yote yawezekana bila Nyang wara (all is possible without Nyang wara).Some Cord MCAs who signed the petition to remove Kidero from office have started writing to the clerk to withdraw their signatures, citing intimidation.
