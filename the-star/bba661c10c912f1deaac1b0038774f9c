The NHIF is targeting 12 million Kenyans in the informal sector.CEO Geoffrey Mwangi said the fund is committed to offer better health insurance to Kenyans. We have been going round the country to conduct informal sector residents registration. There are 12 million people in the informal sector and only 2.5 million are on board, he said.Mwangi spoke in Timau, Meru county, during the Supa Cover informal sector marketing campaign. He said the campaign has been going on for five months.Mwangi said they have rolled out more health benefits that have been received well by Kenyans. The latest is the surgical package in which minor surgeries will be covered for up to Sh80,000 for level three and four hospitals. Major surgeries in level five and six hospitals will be covered for up to Sh130,000, while the fund will pay up to Sh500,000 for specialised surgeries . The new benefits were introduced by NHIF in August. During the launch, fund s board chaired by Mohamud Ali said such payouts will need to be approved first before a member goes for the operation. This will deal with major, minor and specialised surgeries including cancer surgeries, Ali said. Mwangi also said they have also withdrawn the accreditation fees that was being charged on health providers seeking registration. Faith-based facilities were being charged Sh50,000, while private were being charged Sh100,000. Our cover is not discriminatory and there will be a subsidy from the government for the poor, elderly, orphans and the less-privileged, through a special cover from the government, he said.
