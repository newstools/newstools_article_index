Some allies of Raila Odinga are in deep introspection after the IEBC deal that clearly gives President Uhuru Kenyatta sweeping powers in the appointment of new IEBC commissioners. Some claim that everything Siaya Senator James Orengo has handled for Raila over the years has flopped. They mention the Serena talks, where ODM got a raw deal compared to PNU. Then there is the 2013 presidential petition, in which he played a big role and even the Okoa Kenya referendum bid that fell flat on its face. Orengo is among the three Cord Coordinating co-chairpersons, alongside Johnson Muthama and Eseli Simiyu. Some MPs however say the entire team of seven that negotiated the deal and the subsequent accusations against Orengo are insincere.**********Public servants in some ministries are a disgruntled lot. Reason? Their employer has not remitted statutory deductions to the various bodies since June. Also not being remitted are bank and Sacco loans repayments that are ordinarily effected through a check-off system. Worst-hit are the Interior and Information ministries' staff, sources whisper to Corridors. Employees are wondering what is happening. Is the government broke, or is it a classic case of inefficiency? Banks and Saccos are now wiping out every coin that lands in the civil servants accounts, leaving the majority of them entirely broke - and dejected.*********An MP from the North Rift Region is in shock after he scored zero in a course in procurement at a top university in Kenya. Ironically, the vocal MP has been vibrant in raising procurement questions in government but could not demonstrate the same vigour when it came to his Master's class. He will have to resit the unit and will wait longer to graduate.*********A governor from Nyanza recently cried out loud and shed tears when meeting a former MP as he vented his frustrations. This follows the entry of a powerful businessman in the race for the county top job. The governor has fallen out with a powerful woman representative from the region and is now crafting a new line-up. The governor is also alleged to have tried registering a new outfit, outside ODM, which he may use should the party deny him a ticket.********That Kanu still enjoys support in retired President Daniel Moi's Baringo is no surprise. A meeting of more than 100 women leaders in Mogitio last week left no doubt there are many women who plan to vie for seats on the Kanu ticket. Asked why they would prefer the Independence party, the women, both young and old, said they still love Moi Senior.*********Is Governor Kidero working with some Jubilee moles as senior officers in his government? Well, last week, the Governor's senior aide held a meeting with Dagoretti South MP Denis Waweru probably Kidero's biggest rival for the City Hall race - at 680 Hotel. Kidero's handlers who got wind of the meeting now want the boss to deal with "the mole".
