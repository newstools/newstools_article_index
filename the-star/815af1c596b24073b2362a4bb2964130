Marakwet East MP Bowen Kangogo has said he is tired of burying his constituents killed by bandits in the Kerio Valley.He has blamed the government for failing to take decisive action to end cattle rustling. Every weekend I have to attend burials or take injured people to hospital. I m really tired of seeing my people get killed, yet the government has the ability to end this problem, Kangogo said.He spoke to journalists in Marakwet on Sunday. Kangogo urged Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet (right) to visit the families suffering because of frequent attacks. Nkaissery cancelled a visit to the region last week. More than 500 people have fled their homes along the border between Marakwet East and Tiaty constituencies, after one person was killed and three others injured by bandits. Tot Subcounty Hospital and three primary schools have been closed.The three schools are Tot, Chesawach and Top Shiners Academy. Health executive Thomas Ruto said 35 hospital workers have fled. Armed youth cut off water supply to the hospital and threatened to attack staff, forcing the county government to close it. Marakwet East deputy county commissioner Fredrick Ndambuki said the government has deployed officers to stop the attacks between the Marakwet and Pokot communities. However, Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos said the government should deploy more security teams.
