The Immigration department is set to address concerns on KFCB chief executive Ezekiel Mutua's diplomatic passport, which he posted on Facebook."I did not even have to go to the embassy for biometrics or pay the visa application fee. It was delivered to my office free of charge," Mutua wrote.The department said on its official Twitter account that the matter will be dealt with during its Live Chat session on Thursday.They are also expected to explain who qualifies to get a diplomatic passport.The constitution says people entitled to the passports include the President and DP, their immediate families and Speakers of Parliament.Senior security officers including the IG, Chief of Defence Forces, KDF Service Commanders,governors, Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice and their immediate families also qualify.In the event the country has a Prime Minister, such a person and his immediate family are also entitled to the document.Mutua, who does not qualify based on these stipulations, thanked Kenya's Foreign Affairs ministry and US Embassy officials for facilitating the documents, saying "to God be the glory".The CEO was reacting to remarks by a journalist that he would never set foot in the "land of milk and honey" due to his stand on lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders and atheists.Read: Ezekiel Mutua bans 'girls only' party, terms it 'orgy of lesbians'Mutua's post led to a heated exchange after someone wrote in a local daily that: "I will never get a visa to the US".But the Kenya Film Classification Board CEO insulted his friends on the social media platform after users trolled him for the post on Monday.Mutua, who has been vocal about 'promoting moral values', also resorted to 'unfriending' anyone who criticised the post.He later posted more photos of himself flying first class to Dubai and later San Francisco.Read: Ezekiel Mutua insults Facebook friends for trolling post on diplomatic passport
