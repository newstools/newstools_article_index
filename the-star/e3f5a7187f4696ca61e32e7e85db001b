A cassava meal nearly caused the death of 15 family members, including nine children, in the drought-stricken Miritini rural area of Kilifi county.The family bought the cassava and prepared the meal reportedly after going three days without eating.But after eating on Tuesday, some of them vomited and had bouts of diarrhoea.Dhahabu Wanje, the children's grandmother, said she found them eating raw cassava when she got home.She said she joined them and that they later had a roasted portion. I left home for a funeral after eating the cassava but I was called back and told everyone had been complaining of a stomachache," she said.She described their condition as bad saying some of the children collapsed after vomiting.The family members said they ate the cassava even though it was bitter; they said they had no choice as they were hungry.The people were rushed to Marafa health centre as they could not be attended to at Bore Singwaya dispensary.All of them were admitted in critical condition but are responding well to treatment.George Angore, doctor in charge at the hospital, said a delay in taking the family to hospital would have made matters worse.More than 300,000 people and thousands of animals in Kilifi are starving due to the drought that has hit the area.In Magarini alone, more than 100,000 people have been relying on relief food which is not enough. Those directly affected by the drought are about 56,000.Marafa MCA Renson Kambi led a delegation of county officials in visiting the patients in hospital.Kambi blamed the drought and urged the government to intervene to prevent the loss of lives. The Devolution ministry always claims there is a lot of food for hunger-stricken areas but the disaster is normally politicised, leaving victims suffering.
