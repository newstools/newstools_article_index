ODM leader Raila Odinga has told leaders who left the party for Jubilee that they have dug their own political graves.He said the group, especially those from Cord strongholds, will not make it during 2017 general election. Speaking in Kwale at the conclusion of his four-day tour of Coast, he asked those who will lose the nomination to rally behind winners of the party's ticket.He also paraded six candidates who have expressed interest in replacing Kwale governor Salim Mvurya.The six, who were introduced during a rally at Baraza Park, will fight it out for the ODM ticket in 2017 after Mvurya joined Jubilee.They include Kwale Speaker Sammy Ruwa, Gereza Dena, Nicholas Zani, Issa Chipera, and Mohammed Mwarapayo.Amb Chirau Mwakwere was represented by Simeon Mkalla, with Raila promising to teach Mvurya a lesson in 2017.Raila said that Kwale will remain an ODM zone despite the fact that governor Mvurya defected to Jubilee Party.Read: Raila castigates Jubilee defectors, says they are anti-devolution Mombasa governor Hassan Joho said that Mvurya and others who have defected should expect to suffer in the hands of Jubilee like former CS Kazungu Kambi, Charity Ngilu, Chirau Mwakwere among others."Soon you will see your governor Mvurya, LungaLunga MP Khatib Mwashetani, Kwale woman rep Zainab Chidzuga, Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung aro and Mustafa Iddi among others being used and dumped by Jubilee," Joho said."People are claiming they are joining the government because of development.
