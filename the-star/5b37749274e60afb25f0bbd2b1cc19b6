A chunk of the Sh300 billion set aside for the 47 counties ended up in individuals' pockets instead of serving taxpayers, Auditor General Edward Ouko has said.Ouko revealed this on Wednesday saying the agency is set to release an audit report of corruption in the county and national governments.He said their findings indicate corruption is still rampant in the 47 counties, a situation that he noted has significantly limited development.He spoke after launching the Parliamentary Initiatives Network (PIN) guide to audit reports at a Nairobi hotel.Ouko, who did not disclose when the report will be released, said most resources at county and national government levels need close monitoring. "We ask the EACC and relevant parliamentary committees to taming corruption and ensuring Kenyans get value for their taxes," he said.The auditor said the agency would have been best-placed to tackle the rampant theft of public resources but is starved of resources.Ouko said his office requires more resources to study all the financial statements and prepare reports. "We also have to ensure we have verified information gathered. Unfortunately we have a small team and minimal resources," he said."We call on everyone in the country to take the responsibility of monitoring public assets as well as government expenditure."Ouko told the gathering that county and national government officials can only be stopped from stealing if the audit team is well facilitated.Read: Senators bash Auditor General for sleeping with governorsAlso read: Where s evidence clearing governors? senators ask Auditor General
