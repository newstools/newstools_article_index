Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho will be arrested for ordering the demolition on Friday of a wall put up by KBC on a 22-acre plot said to belong to VoK.Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa said demolishing the wall amounted to breaking the law. There was a court order allowing the state broadcaster to build the wall, he said.Marwa said anyone who breaks the law must be arrested, irrespective of their status. Joho is no exception, the coordinator said.Marwa did not say when the governor will be arrested. If he breaks the law and gets arrested, is there a problem? he said at a briefing in his office yesterday.Marwa said the county government paid goons to destroy government property, causing enormous losses.The land has been under dispute for years, with KBC claiming ownership.Marwa urged Joho to return part of the allegedly grabbed Kongowea Market before he encroaches on the land at VoK. On Friday, Joho witnessed the demolition. He said he will not allow KBC to put up the wall until it gets approval from the government.However, a receipt from KBC shows the county was paid Sh521,100 on August 26, 2014, for approval of the wall.But Joho said there are some outstanding rates which KBC ought to have paid first.He said part of the land had been sold to the former municipal council and there is a pending court case.The governor said KBC ought to have waited for the case to be determined before taking any step.He denied there is a court order allowing KBC to build the wall.An order issued by judge A Omollo on April 27 states that KBC was given the go-ahead to build the wall. The prayer of the plaintiff to complete fencing off the property to fend off any further encroachment be and is hereby permitted purely to preserve the suit property, the order read in part.Marwa said of all the governors, Joho is the only one who demolishes public property. This madness must stop, he said.
