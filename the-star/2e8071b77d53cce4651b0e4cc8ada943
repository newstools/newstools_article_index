Cord-affiliated parties will not dissolve to form one mega outfit like Jubilee did, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has said.He said there are no plans to dissolve Ford Kenya, Wiper or ODM to form one strong party , but members want to make the three parties stronger. Cord will not use Jubilee s style as suggested by some leaders from the ruling coalition, Khalwale said.He said the three parties leaders will come up with a nomination mechanism to identify presidential, governor, senator, woman representative, MP and MCA flagbearers.Khalwale said dissolving parties will take the country back to the one-party rule. It should not be lost that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto are spiritual, political and ideological orphans of former President Moi and they wish we would go back to the old days when Kenya was ruled by one party, he said.Khalwale said the constitution clearly states that Kenya is a multi-party state and leaders paid dearly to bring the country to where it is today. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Masinde Muliro, Martin Shikuku, Kenneth Matiba and others played a very crucial role in making Kenya a multi-party democracy. We cannot water down their efforts, he said.The senator said Kenyans should respect the law and cease following statements blindly . In 2013, Uhuru and Ruto came together to get a leverage to fix their case at the ICC. Nobody should be cheated that national unity can be achieved through minimising the number of political parties, Khalwale said.He said Kenyans are enjoying strength in diversity and different ethnic groups are living together in harmony. Kikuyus and Somalis are doing business in all parts of the country. Luhyas and Luos work in almost all major towns. Other tribes have come together in education, health and other occupations and they don t fight. Which unity will come out of dissolving political parties? Khalwale asked.
