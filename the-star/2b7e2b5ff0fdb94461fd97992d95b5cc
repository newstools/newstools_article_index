Yatta opinion leaders are unperturbed after their MP Francis Mwangangi (pictured) defected to the Jubilee Party. Mwangangi was elected on a Muungano Party ticket in 2013, after he had been rigged out in the Wiper nominations. Though Mwangangi weathered the Wiper candidate s advantage to win the Yatta seat, most opinion leaders in Yatta still believe the Kalonzo or Wiper wave will not influence Mwangangi s reelection bid. This is due to his solid skills with the electorate.************ A senior member of the judiciary has become a thorn in the flesh with his excesses. The judicial official has been carrying children and house helps on all official assignments and expecting the judiciary to pay for the extra expenses. This despite the fact that all judiciary officials know how much they are allowed to use in nights out and out-of-station allowances. So arrogant is the official that he has simply dismissed regulations. It is just a matter of time before his excesses come to light.************ A group of Central Police Station-based plainclothes officers has been harassing and indiscriminately arresting youth walking in the CBD. On Friday, the cops confronted two youths near the Kencom bus stage and demanded Sh1,000 from each of them. When they could not produce the money, despite two hours of haggling, they were booked at the station for allegedly preparing to commit a felony. A 51-year-old victim of a similar cop extortion in has been held at the station for the past one week without being charged.********* MPs who received facilitation fees to host delegates during the Jubilee merger may be in for a rude shock come 2017. Our mole within the corridors of Bunge tells this column that those who squandered or used the money for unintended purposes could be denied party tickets as punishment for behaving badly. Corridors has it that last week on Thursday afternoon, despite being on a month-long recess, the MPs in large numbers thronged Parliament Buildings to receive the loot at a designated office. But once they pocketed the amount, they quickly disappeared. The majority of them did not even bother to return calls from the powers that be, something that greatly infuriated those who chose to care.*********** Just what happened to the investigations into the Eurobond saga? The last we heard an investigating team from the Office of the Auditor General had been appointed to travel to the USA to find more information from the banks involved in the transactions. However, Corridors has it that though the officers were to travel in June, they are yet to go.
