Bungoma Jubilee MCAs have dismissed claims that they have endorsed a Cord candidate for the governor seat.Majority leader Henry Nyongesa on Thursday said they did not participate in the endorsement of former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khangati.Nyongesa said the MCAs just attended a meeting Khangati organised for elected leaders."We refute reports that we supported a candidate. We have our preferred candidate and we should not be pushed," he said. Nyongesa stated that MCAs who attended the event from Jubilee had only been hoodwinked into gracing the meeting.He said their preferred candidate is the incumbent Kenneth Lusaka, further citing that they were firmly in Jubilee."As 30 Jubilee MCAs, we are supporting Lusaka. Cord can have their candidate but they should not say they have MCAs from our side," Nyongesa said.This comes 35 MCAs from the county said they had endorsed Khangati of ODM to unseat Lusaka.Minority leader Ali Machani led the MCAs, where the group said they support Khangati since he has interests of the people at heart.Read: Bungoma MCAs abandon Lusaka, endorse ODM's Khang ati for governor
