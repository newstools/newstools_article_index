Laikipia county will have more than 300km of tarmac road starting next year, Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has said.Speaking in Nanyuki town yesterday, Kiunjuri said the county will benefit from infrastructure projects to be launched by the national government. The county has less than 100km of tarmacked roads.Some of the roads to be upgraded are Nanyuki-Mutara-Gwa Kung u road, Naromoru-Lamuria road, and the Kinamba-Sipili-Njangili stretch. Others are in Nanyuki , Nyahururu towns and Rumuruti Township.Kiunjuri urged the residents to support the government so they can benefit from more development. We must tell you what the government is doing because these are facts. This is not politics as some people may suggest, Kiunjuri said.On local politics Kiunjuri, who lost the governor s race to Joshua Irungu in 2013, said he has no preferred candidate for any seat.Cabinet secretaries are supposed to be technocrats and are not allowed to engage in politics.Governor hopefuls are former Foreign Affairs PS Thuita Mwangi, businessman Mburu Kamau, former Laikipia West MP Nderitu Muriithi and technocrat James Mathenge. Others are deputy governor Gitonga Kabugi, recently sacked county secretary John Mwaniki and the incumbent Joshua Irungu.Regional politics in the county will be a major factor in elections, as residents from Laikipia East and Laikipia North subcounties feel marginalised. Kiunjuri has said he will not stand but will support the reelection of UhuRuto.
