Residents of Uthiru-Rithimitu ward, Dagoretti South, are raising money to repair roads. They are gravelling the Kiuru road, which branches from Muhuri Road off the Nairobi-Nakuru highway and leads to Kiuru ACK church.Resident Sam British said they have been forced to take action, as area leaders have not addressed their concerns. Last week, we raised Sh10,000, paid the transporters and the youth. We are filling the potholes, British said. In 2014, MCA John Waweru said roads would be prioritised when Ward Development Fund cash is released.
