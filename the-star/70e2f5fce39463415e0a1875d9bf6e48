Kisumu MCAs who were suspended for gross misconduct have said the decision was politically instigated and vowed to teach assembly speaker Ann Adul a lesson at the next election.Wilis Ongonyo (Muhoroni), Osumba Olum (Kolwa East), Moses Ochele (Wawidhi) and Samuel Ong ou (Masogo-Nyang oma) were suspended following disorderly conduct during sessions on Wednesday and Thursday last week.The assembly was discussing a report on the alleged mismanagement of the Ward Development Fund. Adul suspended them over gross misconduct and barred them from the assembly and committee meetings. She said during the session, she was threatened, a clerical officer assaulted, and documents forming the business of the day violently ripped off from her hands and trashed and shredded by two MCAs.Ong ou, suspended for eight sittings, said they are ready to meet the speaker and her team at the next election. He said the person who should be suspended is the speaker because she is the one causing chaos . We have a rogue speaker, Ong ou said.The MCAs accused Adul of lying about the approval of the Ward Development Fund report, yet this did not occur as the assembly was adjourned on Wednesday.Ochele, suspended for 28 sittings, said they were targeted by the speaker because of her political interest. We know very well she has taken sides. What s surprising is the suspension of the Budget chairman Willis Ogonyo, who is harmless and does not even speak much, he said.Ochele said they are aware that this was done because the county government had prepared a supplementary budget to be taken to the assembly to speed up contractors payments. We know they want the budget to flop so they can stage-manage protests by contractors against Ranguma, he said. Ochele said he will take action against the speaker but will let the law take its course.
