Kenya Police have taken a nine point lead going into the final round of the Sportpesa National Boxing League.True to their word, Police qualified all their boxers in the ten final contests in Machakos over the weekend to avenge the humiliating defeat they had suffered at the hands of Kenya Defence Forces in Thika.Police coached by 1990 Auckland Commonwealth Games gold medalist George Foreman Onyango fought their hearts out scoring 20 points against the soldier s 11. We were really determined to prove a point after our Thika debacle where some of our boxers missed out due to injury. However, we anticipate a very tough occasion in the last leg.I believe it will be difficult to stop us, said Onyango.In one of the highlights of the finals, Beijing Olympian Aziz Ali suffered defeat to Tobias Okeyo of Police. The judges scores it 2-1 in favour of Okeyo.Aziz who is the most experienced boxer in the Prisons side had hoped to meet Elly Ajowi in a grudge match but the latter moved up to the light heavyweight category. Ajowi, a Kenya team boxer defeated Hezron Maganga of KDF.Prions coached by former Kenya team captain and 1987 All African Games gold medallist Maurice Kawata Maina still retain third spot despite their poor showing in Machakos.Prisons who have lost boxers like Rayton Okwiri to the AIBA Pro Boxing competition and Daniel Shisia (who has retired) have struggled to maintain their quality. Budget constraints have affected our performance but we have tried to survive under the conditions, said Maina.Prisons last won the League title in 1999 and hope to end the dominance of Police and the Armed Forces.
