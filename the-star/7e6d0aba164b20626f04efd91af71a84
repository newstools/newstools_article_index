Mandera security agents have foiled many al Shabaab attacks in the past three months, county commissioner Fredrick Shisia has said.He said on Tuesday this has been possible through coordinated efforts by the National Intelligence Service, police and the Kenya Defence Forces. Shisia said collaboration among security teams is part of Kenya s new strategy to thwart terror attacks.He said police have changed patrol strategy to outwit al Shabaab, who are known to trek for long distances to execute attacks. We are now using vital intelligence to seal hotspots, where our officers do not use vehicles to avoid being detected by our enemy, Shisia said.The hotspots include Sheikh Baruk, Lafey, Fino, Daba City, Omar Jillo and areas neighbouring the Somalia border.The commissioner said communities have volunteered vital information that has led to the arrest of suspects crossing the porous border with Somalia.He warned Sheikh Baruk residents in Lafey subcounty against helping terrorists.Shisia accused them of giving vital security information to al Shabaab, who use it to fight security agents patrolling the area.A major security operation has led to many arrests of suspects involved in planting improvised explosive devices on the road.The newly formed Jubaland government has been in the forefront in giving information to the Kenyan government to stop attacks.In June, the Jubaland authorities displayed a deadly cache of arms destined for Mandera seized in a Somalia town.Last month, the KDF handed over eight suspects to police. They are believed to be part of a gang involved in robbery in Mandera town. The suspects were arraigned in a Mandera court.
