Ojwang was sixth even after heated debate," a twitter user said. "The man who will not allow anything to get on the way of his sabbath has been named Kenya's Chief Justice. David Maraga it is," said James Smart."I think David Maraga will be a great CJ even though I didn't see that coming. I thought about Wanjala and Kitonga. Congratulations Maraga," said Karani Mutonga.Others even went to an extent of asking questions such as: Who is David maraga? said Alex Ogeto "Does this man drink? Is he married? Does he have personal wealth? Who are his relatives? Who went to school with him?""Does his being SDA affect his approach to policy?""Congratulations to David Maraga. Someone sent me the info yesterday that he'd be the CJ but I doubted it. Interesting," Robert Alai said. "An underdog David Maraga nominated the new CJ," another user known as Nick said.
