The government, through the Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council, seeks partnerships with the African Development and the World banks to eradicate the menace. Kenttec chairman Dr David Wanyonyi said plans are at an advanced stage to rope in the partners to improve tourism and agriculture. He said areas such as the Lambwe Valley in South Nyanza and Mwea in Central have in the past been hit by the tsetse fly, but this has been corrected through the support of the Jubilee government. The government has been very supportive of these initiatives and its active involvement in aiding partnerships with organisations such as Icipe have led to the success story in Mwea and Lambwe, Wanyonyi said.He said tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis eradication will open up the European market for farmers. There is some Sh20 billion out there that will come in through meat exports and tourism, he said. Acting CEO Dr Pamela Olet said both President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have been in the forefront supporting eradication of diseases that threaten the livestock sector. The President visited our stand at the Mombasa ASK show and pledged full support to Kenttec initiatives. We are very grateful for the support, she said.
