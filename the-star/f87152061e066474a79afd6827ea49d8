The Commission on Administrative Justice has raised the alarm over a decision to move the University of Nairobi s Kenya Science Campus for its premises to be occupied by the Kenya Technical Teachers College. The decision was made by Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i.Matiang i s directive requires the campus to vacate the premises by December 1. CAJ chairman Otiende Amollo said this should only be done after consultations with all stakeholders.He said the decision would disrupt studies and inconvenience students as the institution has two fully equipped labs, which will also have to be surrendered. Amollo said UoN cannot accommodate the 1,038 students to be affected in its hostels because it has an overstretched population of 84,000 students.Amollo said building another campus would cost Sh12 billion. He said UoN is a distinct legal entity and the transfers involve legal procedures. The commission questioned why the college is being moved and what the land would be used for.
