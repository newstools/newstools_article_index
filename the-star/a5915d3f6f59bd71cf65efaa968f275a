He is challenging his prosecution over a Sh1.2 billion security tender.Ndung u s charges arise from the award of a Sh1.2 billion tender for the installation of security software at the CBK. According to documents in possession of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Ndung u attempted to confer a benefit on one of the bidders Horsebridge Systems East Africa Ltd by directing that the contract be given to the bidder, notwithstanding the termination.Murgor recused herself on grounds she was once a lawyer for the Central Bank and hearing the appeal would amount to conflict of interest.The parties now await a new bench to be constituted. Ndung u, through lawyer Cecil Miller, filed submissions yesterday, saying his intended prosecution is a violation of his rights.
