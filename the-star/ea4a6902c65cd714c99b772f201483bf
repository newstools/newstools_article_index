Yesterday was the International Day of the Girl Child, a UN tribute to more than a billion girls worldwide (see page 12).The Day s theme this year is Girls Progress = Girls Progress: A Global Girls Data Movement .The statistics of how violence, discrimination and inequality daily defeat too many girls dreams around the world, but especially in Africa, are atrocious.In Kenya, early child marriages and female genital mutilation remain major challenges.A report by Save The Children, entitled Every Last Girl: Free to Live, Free to Learn, Free from Harm , ranks countries in an index from the best to worst in which to be a girl, based on child marriage, schooling, teen pregnancy, maternal deaths and number of female legislators.The report registers a harrowing statistic: Every seven seconds around the world, a girl aged below 15 years is married off. The scale of this threat is totally unacceptable.And the world, all the world, needs to be a part of the solution, not the terrible problem.
