Defiling children, corruption, drug trafficking and terrorism should be classified as capital offences, Uasin Gishu residents have said. They were giving their views in Eldoret town on Monday during the ongoing national debate on capital punishment.They said people who sexually molest children, causing them harm or exposing them to life-threatening diseases and conditions, should face the death penalty.The residents said the government should address the root cause of capital offences. They said majority of those jailed for capital offences are youth who committed the crimes because of drugs and illicit brew. The majority of our youth are walking dead because of drug abuse. Drug traffickers and those importing killer brews should be charged with capital offences because they are killing our children, Ruth Kosgey said.She said treating economic crimes and corruption as capital offences would serve as deterrence. Civil society, clerics, community-based organisations, the Law Society of Kenya and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions representatives said the death penalty should be abolished, while ordinary citizens said it should be upheld.LSK North Rift representative Zephania Yego said abolishing the death penalty is overdue. Kenya has a progressive constitution, which does not condone killing people. Capital offenders should be sentenced to life imprisonment or more than 50 years, he said. Resident Mohammed Ali said the death penalty should be upheld, particularly for murder.
