To usher in Valentine's the Sarova Panafric hosted a Treat Your Man: Ladies take over edition last Friday night. Hosted by celebrity couple Nameless and Wahu, the event included a lingerie fashion show featuring designs from Palmers and Incanto Designs. The sleek models from Kinkey models in their barely there outfits, most certainly ensured a rise in room temperature as they strutted down the catwalk to music from DJ D-Lite on the decks.
