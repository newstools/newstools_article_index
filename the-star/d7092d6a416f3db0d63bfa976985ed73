Meru Governor Peter Munya has been asked to stop blaming Deputy President William Ruto for "his low political performance".North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood and church leader Edwin Bundi said Munya s role is based at the county level, whereas Ruto s is of a national outreach. Munya should respect the Deputy President. Their difference is like daylight and night. There is no way Ruto can come to Meru to fight Munya, we are the only ones who can be able to fight the governor , said Bundi.They spoke at Gachiege EAPC Church in North Imenti on Sunday.Last week, Munya who is also the Council of Governors chairman accused the DP of working with his key opponent in the governor race Kiraitu Murungi to "blackmail him as the one behind the ban of miraa in Somalia".Bundi said Munya violated the international protocols when he visited Somaliland to seek new markets, instead of visiting Somali where the central government is. Munya went to visit the leader of a government, which is similar to an opposition front in Somaliland, instead of meeting the bona fide President of Somalia. This angered the central government leader whom we respect because he heard the intervention of President Uhuru Kenyatta and accepted to open the market, he said.Rahim said Somaliland only buys miraa worth Sh1 million daily from Meru, whereas Somalia purchases miraa worth Sh20 million every day.He said the governor should have considered that before visiting Somaliland. Ruto loves Meru and he has visited us severally. I wonder what Munya wants from him. Let him fight his own battles without pulling the Deputy President into his failures, Rahim said.Last month, Munya urged the government to cooperate with Somaliland so it lowers taxes on miraa imports. During his tour, Munya met Somaliland s Deputy President, Foreign Affairs and Finance ministers. He said the region would be accorded some sort of independence if it opens up markets for miraa.
