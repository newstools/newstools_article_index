Eleven suspects facing money laundering charges over the Sh791 million NYS scam yesterday asked a Nairobi court to order former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru to stop commenting on the case.Through their lawyer Maina Wachira, they accused the former CS of making prejudicial statements in public which end up being published in the media.Wachira accused Waiguru of using the NYS case to gain political mileage as she campaigns for the Kirinyaga governor s seat.He told Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku the suspects are likely to be viewed unfavourably if she continues making remarks against them.The suspects urged the court to restrain the Parliamentary Accounts Committee from issuing summonses against them, saying they will subjected to a double trial.Wachira said PAC should give the court time to try the suspects because the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission investigated the matter and referred the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.State lawyer Victor Mule said the DPP has no powers to order and direct Parliament on how to carry out its duties. He urged the magistrate to refer the matter to the High Court for interpretation and directions.
