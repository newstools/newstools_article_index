Comeback king rapper Nyashinski is drifting from the artiste we all used to know back then, to 'something' unpredictable!Months after marking his official music comeback with the monstrous hit Know You Know, the ex-Kleptomaniax rap god is at it again.However, this time he is not the usual Nyash we all know about.On Thursday, during the October edition of the monthly music event Industry Nite held at Nairobi's Gallileo Lounge in Westlands, the rapper-singer dropped a major gospel tune.Titled Mungu Pekee, the jam makes his third track after announcing his comeback a few months ago.His first song since making his much-awaited return was on a song he did with Nameless called Letigo.His latest release will for sure become one of the region's major hits by a Kenyan artiste in the present times.Other performers at the event included singer Qritical, Steph Kapela, Zonda, Dave Ndegwa and Moonboy among others.See the photos below.Artistes Wahu, Collo and Nameless and comedian JB Masanduku join Nyashinski on stage.Qritical.Moonboy.Host Sheila Kwamboka.Steph Kapela.Kelvin K.Dave Ndegwa.Nyashinski, Brand UB and Talia Oyando.Photos/BRIAN SIMIYU
