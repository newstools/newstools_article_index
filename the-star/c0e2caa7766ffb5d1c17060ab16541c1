Bungoma woman representative Reginalda Wanyonyi has urged Cord leaders to stop threatening members who defected to Jubilee with calls for by-elections.She said elected leaders can exercise their democratic rights by moving to different parties.Speaking in Bumula constituency on Saturday, Wanyonyi said it is improper for Cord leaders to demand by-elections. We have only 10 months to the general election and it would be unfair to subject voters to by-elections instead of allowing them to prepare for a major poll, she said.
