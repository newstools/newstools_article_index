Homa Bay senator Moses Kajwang has asked Cord co-principals to stop nagging Raila Odinga to endorse them for the presidency.Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) have been in the past recent weeks asking Raila to support them for the top seat in 2017."Raila cannot be traversing the entire country popularising his candidature yet other leaders only pull chairs and call press conferences in Nairobi to demand that he [Raila] endorses them for the top job. That is not fair by any standard. Let every leader sell himself and hunt for votes," Kajwang said.Read: Stop pestering Raila to endorse you, Wetang'ula toldKajwang spoke at Likuyani grounds during the official opening of a resource center on Monday.He was accompanied by nominated senator Daisy Kanainza.Raila, in a separate meeting in the area, assured his supporters that he was in good terms with his co-principals Musyoka and Wetang'ula.Kanainza asked residents to register as voters in large numbers in Cord strongholds to replace the Jubilee administration next year.She asked youth and women to refuse to vote along tribal lines in the next polls.Also read: Focus on promoting Raila, not endorsing hopefuls, Joho told
