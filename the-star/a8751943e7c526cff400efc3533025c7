Vihiga MP Yusuf Chanzu has called for the arrest of Governor Moses Akaranga for allegedly misappropriating funds amounting to more than Sh2 billion.Chanzu said on Sunday that there were criminal elements in the issuance of contracts awarded two years ago, for which the county is yet to issue payments. The contractors have approached me for advice over the delayed payments and I will be enjoining them in their plans to sue the county government, he told the Star on the phone. If Akaranga cannot pay the contractors for tenders awarded two years ago, where he will get the money he is promising to pay them yet the county is set to receive Sh4.5 billion this financial year?"More on this: MCAs 'compromised' in Sh2.5bn reportAlso read: How can Vihiga be in Sh2.5bn debt - KhaniriChanzu said the Senate was also investigating the county government for the funds which it cannot account for. He said Akaranga should be compelled to explain where the money is.Read: MCAs paid to kill Vihiga debt reportThe contractors led by Alfred Okubi said that they had already identified a lawyer to take Akaranga to court over the outstanding bills.Okubi also said they will petition the Senate to ask the IEBC to bar the Governor from running in 2017. We want to sue the government so that we can protect our debts because we may not be paid if Akaranga loses the election next year, he said.Efforts to reach Akaranga for comment were futile; he is said to have left for France over the weekend.County head of communication Peter Athiaya said the hitch that led to delays in paying contractors had been resolved and the process started.Athiaya said that the Governor explained to the Senate that no money was lost when he appeared before Public Accounts Committee on two days.A meeting between the Governor and contractors turned chaotic last Thursday after Akaranga failed to give a clear proposal on how they would be paid.He had asked the contractors to appoint three representatives to meet him on Friday but the meeting aborted.The contractors said chief officers in the Governor's administration had looted the county and built palatial homes across Western.Also read: Vihiga's Sh1.7 million internet, Sh11 million toilet to be probed
