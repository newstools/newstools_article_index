Bungoma presiding judge Abida Aroni yesterday said her lowest moment was when the Bomas draft was rejected by Kenyans in the 2005 referendum.She said as vice chairman of the commission, billions of shillings were spent to draft the document, which never came to pass."A lot of taxpayers' money was spent, but it is known what happened to the draft that was to give Kenya a second constitution," Aroni said.She was being interviewed for Deputy Chief Justice yesterday.,Aroni said she is ready to back Chief Justice nominee David Maraga as judiciary president.She said corrupt officers should be dismissed from the judiciary.Aroni said though there are good judicial officers, the few bad ones are tainting the name of the courts."Most judicial officers are honest but there is a negative perception about them," the judge said.Aroni said she would want to see all court proceedings automated to speed up justice.She said she will particularly pay attention to the Commercial Division, where cases involving billions of shillings slow down the economy.Aroni said she has been beyond reproach in her private practice and as a judge.In 2013, the Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board found her unsuitable to hold office.She was later found suitable to serve after re-vetting.Sixteen candidates have been lined-up to succeed retired DCJ Kalpana Rawal who was retired in July.The DCJ is the deputy head of judiciary and vice president of the Supreme Court.Aroni was the first candidate to be interviewed in the morning, followed by Court of Appeal judge Agnes Murgor in the afternoon.The interviews will take about two weeks.
