Jubilee Party national steering committee officials are set to fly to China for a month-long training on how to run the newly launched outfit.The first group of the officials from the 12 parties that folded up last month to form JP are expected to leave for Beijing on Sunday night.The second group will then travel to the Asian country for what they have briefed as a training on how to run and manage a party for 100 years without collapsing."I can confirm they are traveling but talk to the national steering committee co-chairman Kiraitu Murungi for more details," Onyango Oloo, former TNA SG, said.Calls to Kiraitu were unanswered while the other co-chiarman Noah Wekesa said he was in a meeting.On Thursday, the JP officials were hosted for a briefing at the Chinese embassy in Nairobi."We were at the embassy where we were briefed on a number of issues. The aim of the trip is purely training on general organisation of the party, mobilisation of resources and registration of members as well as capacity building," a member of the steering committee who sought anonymity told the Star on Friday.The group will be trained by officials of the Communist Party of China - the founding and the ruling political party of the People's Republic of China.CPC is currently the world's second largest political party with a membership of 88.76 million as at 2016. Two years ago, CPC announced that it work closely with the Jubilee coalition to strengthen cooperation between the two political parties.Guo Jinglong, a CPC official, told President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House Nairobi in July 2014 that the party and Jubilee share common principles of mutual equality and non-interference.Read: China communist party to work with Jubilee Guo is a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC central committee and secretary of the CPC Beijing municipal committee."We value our relationship with Kenya and now see a lot of opportunity for further cooperation between our parties," he said during the courtesy call.President Kenyatta appreciated China s support to Kenya, especially in infrastructure development."With China s support, we are rebuilding our railway line which will help reduce the cost of transport and doing business not just within Kenya but the whole region," Kenyatta said.Read: Kenya is keen on exploring for gas and oil with China, says Uhuru during talks
