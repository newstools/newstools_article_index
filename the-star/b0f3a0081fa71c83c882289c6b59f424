Kenyan model Dorothy Oliech founded Mochez Models in 2006 to train models and dancers after enjoying a successful modelling career. To mark its tenth year, she hosted a grand party on Saturday afternoon at the African Heritage House, Mlolongo, Machakos. And aptly so. It was the same venue that she was discovered by the house co-founder Allan Donovan. Fashion houses Kiko Romeo and Vaishali Morjaria put up an excellent display on the catwalk. In attendance were Rialto Fashions Lucy Rao, designer Deepa Dosaja, Prime Homes &amp; Gardens owner Emma Too.
