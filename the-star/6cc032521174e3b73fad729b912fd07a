Cord leader Raila odinga yesterday said the Jubilee administration is using the IEBC commissioners to do early rigging before leaving the office.He said the opposition will take to the streets if the commissioners are not gone by October 10.He also said the opposition would not take part in the elections. The Jubilee has been trying to apply delaying tactics with the matter. This is a clear tactic to use the team to rig the elections, Raila said. We will use all means to ensure they move out of the office, because Kenyans can no longer trust them to conduct the next elections. He spoke during a rally in Ilmashariani, Narok county.In attendance were Governors Evans Kidero (Nairobi), Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), John Nyagarama (Nyamira), Senators James Orengo (Siaya) and Agnes Zani (nominated).Others were MPs John Mbadi (Suba East), Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay woman rep), Millie Odhiambo (Mbita), Junet Mohammed (Suna East), Joseph Ndiege (Suna West) and Abdikadir Aden (Balambala).Earlier, Raila opened the ODM Narok county office and visited the home of former Heritage minister William ole Ntimama, who was buried on September 14.He said the Jubilee leadership has realised only nine months are remaining to the general elections and they have nothing to show to Kenyans on what they have done since they ascended to power in 2013. I urge all the communities to get prepared to flush the IEBC commissioners out of their offices. We had agreed with Jubilee to vacate their positions to the pave way for new team who handle the next polls without being biased, Raila said.He urged the Maasai community to vote for him, saying the community suffered a lot from historical land injustices. Raila said he is the only leader who can rectify the mess done by the previous regime.Kidero, Awiti and Nyangarama urged Kenyans to vote for Raila.
