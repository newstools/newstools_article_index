Jubilee is in denial about the Western vote, Musalia Mudavadi has said and asked DP William Ruto to note the difference between curiosity and political support.Mudavadi termed Ruto a "caricature" that everyone wants to see, not out of love but because of the "funny things" surrounding it.Ruto said on Saturday said that his extensive forays into opposition strongholds were yielding fruits.But Mudavadi, who is Amani leader, said: The DP is in a dream where crowds are mesmerised at the nakedness of the king but who assumes that it is a display of love by his subjects."Noting 15 MPs from Western, 11 from Wiper and 18 from Coast had joined Jubilee Party, Ruto said it was the party to beat in the 2017 general election.But Mudavadi said that MPs who defected have problems selling the outfit in Western since they are not "with the people".The Amani leader said his coalition was the biggest beneficiary of the legal framework on party hopping under the amended Elections Act.He told the Star by phone on Tuesday that JP was a hoax and that leaders who defected to it will soon regret their moves.Mudavadi said Luhyas were tired of insults by the DP and his allies and want to redefine themselves.He said they were aware that Jubilee was mismanaging the country but that they will not be hoodwinked into supporting it in 2017.Cord is working on a 'super alliance' with Amani, Kanu and Cyrus Jirongo's United Democratic Party.Leader Raila Odinga is spearheading the initiative that aims to bring together several opposition groupings.More on this: [VIDEO] Raila crafting 'super alliance' of opposition
