Kilifi woman representative Aisha Jumwa yesterday accused the government of not fulfilling campaign pledges made before the 2013 elections. She said Jubilee does not understand residents problems. I urge residents to vote for Cord for change, Jumwa said at Madunguni in Malindi constituency. She said only Cord chief Raila Odinga and Governor Amason Kingi can bring change.
