She s clumsy, she s vivacious and she s back! Bridget Jones is perhaps the most adored British film character of the last 15 years. Bridget finally meets a man she likes and, as fate would have it, her ex comes back into her life at the same time. The consequence of dating both men? Not knowing who the father of her baby is. This third instalment of the franchise is just as charming and hilarious as its predecessors. Ren e Zellweger does a tremendous job of reviving the charisma and spirit of her character, 12 years later. Patrick Dempsey is a wonderful addition to the cast. Star Rating: 4/5
