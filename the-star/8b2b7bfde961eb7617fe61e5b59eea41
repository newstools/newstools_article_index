Paralympics sprinter Henry Nzungi is scheming to upgrade to middle distance races after dismal performance at the 2016 Rio Paralympics.After a 7-year stint in sprints, Nzungi who was highly tipped to win a medal, didn t make the final cut in both the T.12 200m and 400m events.In an interview, he said he will move to T.12 800m and 1,500m.The All Africa Games T.12 400m gold medalist, who was disqualified in the 400m in Rio, hinted that he will commence his training for the middle distances in mid October. It is uncharacteristic of me to commit a lane violation though that day I was running at a terrific speed and given my visual impairment, I did not anticipate this. That was so discouraging, observed Nzungi, who ran the T.12 400m race (September 10) before his coaches Michael Omondi and George Misati arrived in Rio (September 12). With 800m and 1,500m, sticking to my lane will not be a tough challenge because the speed is not as flashing as in sprinting, added Nzungi who is scheduled to compete at the International Paralympics Committee World Championships in July 2017 in London.Nzungi was among the three Kenyans who were disqualified. Others were Nelly Nasimiyu (T.11 1,500m) and Erick Sang (T.11 1,500m and 5,000m). Kenya placed 35th overall at the Rio Paralympics, winning three gold medals, one silver and two bronze. Team Kenya captain Samuel Mushai won two golds (T.11 1,500m and 5,000m), Henry Kirwa (T.12 1,500m), won one gold, Nancy Chelangat brought Kenya a silver in T.11 1,500m, while Wilson Bii T.11 1,500m, 5,000m and Kirwa T.12 5,000m won a bronze each.
