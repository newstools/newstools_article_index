Three nurses and a KNH support staff member have been arrested in connection to the macabre murder of a patient last November.The four are expected to be arraigned on murder charges on Monday afternoon.The workers were arrested after DPP Keriako Tobiko agreed with police recommendations for charges against them.This followed investigations into the death of 42-year old cancer patient Cosmas Mutunga on November 29, 2015.Mutunga, who was admitted on November 8, was found with several stab wounds and his eye gouged out. His right leg was also broken between the knee and the ankle.Hospital chief executive Lily Koros told the Star last Tuesday that the names of the staff members could not be revealed amid a look into administrative matters.The management of Kenyatta National Hospital was pushed in September to give a public report on internal investigations concerning Mutunga's death.KNH had not received the CID's report, 11 months after the mysterious death.The hospital had termed the case an isolated one and pledged to fully cooperate with investigators.More on this: Three KNH staffers suspended after probe into patient Cosmas Mutunga's murder
