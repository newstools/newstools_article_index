Huawei Mobile Kenya has announced the launch of a personalized service center in Nakuru county as it aims to grow its market share in the smartphone sphere.The launch brings to four the number of such centers the firm has launched having opened one in Nairobi s central business district in June in partnership with Tricom Technologies.Among the hallmarks of the Huawei service centers is a fee screen replacement in the event of damage to flagships such as the P8 and P9 under the warranty period from the point of purchase.The after-sale service was previously not available in the Kenyan market for Huawei device owners.With the setting up of the centers and the availability of highly skilled technicians, Huawei will be seeking to wrest a chunk of the smartphone market share from other competitor brands.The new center in Nakuru is expected to serve over 1000 customers monthly as the firm aims for a completion rate of 90 per cent in solving customer enquiries from the region. Our customers expect immediate help and it s our job to advise them in regard to how they can manage our devices, handle their warranties and software improvements, said Humphrey Mokono, Huawei Mobile s head of Western region. Setting up this center will help customers connect with the customer service representatives for a personalized service, he added in a move which he said will foster long term relations and encourage repeat purchases.To reach a larger market segment, Huawei has another pre-existing agreement with Malibu Telecom which manages service centers in Nairobi [Harambee Avenue] and Mombasa [Nkurumah road].One more center has been planned for Kisumu at a yet unspecified date.Huawei Devices and Sales Director Dharmaraj Diwakar in June said that through such centers, the company will readily engage directly with its customers in a more simplified process.
