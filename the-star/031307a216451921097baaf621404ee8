Four politicians have urged a magistrate to drop charges of hate speech against them on grounds they are defective. Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire, Busia woman representative Florence Mutua, Junet Mohamed of Suna East and Kilifi woman Representative Aisha Jumwa told the court it has no jurisdiction to hear the case.Through lawyer John Khaminwa, the four argued that the charge sheet is false and discriminative.The state, he said, should decide on whether they want to proceed with the case under the Penal Code or under the National Cohesion Integration Commission. No offence has been disclosed in this charge sheet. It s ambiguous and it does not form the basis of prosecution. It ought to be dismissed and the hate speech charges levelled against the accused persons dropped, he said. Bosire, Mutua, Junet and Jumwa are out on a Sh1 million bond with an alternative cash bail of Sh300,000. The case proceeds today.They were among eight MPs who were detained in June for four days for incitement. The government had requested to detain them to allow for investigations. Magistrate Daniel Ogembo upheld an application by the prosecution that the suspects be detained, saying the case is of great public interest.
