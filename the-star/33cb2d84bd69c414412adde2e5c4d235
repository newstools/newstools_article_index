"We have told Matiang'i to immediately release his appointment letter."He said they could not understand why Kosgey was being "blocked" yet he came second in similar interviews at Egerton University.Others who took part in the protest were MPs Sila Tiren (Moiben), James Bett (Kesses) and Uasin Gishu county assembly speaker Isaac Terer.Sudi said: We will cut all trees and use all means possible to block roads and ensure there is no graduation on Friday."He claimed Matiang'i was opposed to the appointment of a Kalenjin.
