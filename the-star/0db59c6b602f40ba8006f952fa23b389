Cord leader Raila Odinga is not interested in electoral reforms but is using that as an excuse to get power through the back door, eight legislators have said. They said Raila has sensed defeat and is looking for a way to force the country to adapt a power-sharing formula like in 2007.The eight said Raila and his brigade want to blame the IEBC for denying them victory before calling for power-sharing formula. ''Raila is not keen on going to elections in 2017 after sensing inevitable defeat. He wants violence to break out after the general election before demanding for a power sharing formula as happened in 2007," MP David Gikaria said.The legislators spoke at the weekend at Kagwapungu Primary School in Imenti South and Kimachia Primary School in Tigania West. The eight are MPs Gikaria, Harrison Kombe, Kinoti Gatobu, Kathuri Muringi, David Karithi, AN Mutura and Jacob Macharia as well as Uasin Gishu Senator Isaac Meli. The legislators said the Cord team has devised propaganda to convince Kenyans that it has been robbed of victory even if it loses the elections. They urged Kenyans not to listen to or support such propaganda.Gikaria said Raila is scheming a situation where the IEBC is dissolved so there is nobody to oversee the elections, thus giving him an excuse to call for power sharing.The legislators pledged to support Deputy President William Ruto's 2022 presidential bid, saying the Meru community should produce his running mate.The eight said CDF should not be scrapped because it is constitutional and it supports underprivileged people. They said many projects have been initiated through CDF and talents nurtured. They cited the football federation, which they said lacks funds to organise local torunaments.
