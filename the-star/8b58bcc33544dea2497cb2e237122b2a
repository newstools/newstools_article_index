Kisauni MP Rashid Bedzimba has said his constituency is far ahead in development compared with other constituencies in Mombasa. I do not like to engage in propaganda, mine are projects that can be seen, Bedzimba said. Last Thursday, the MP presented Sh26.2 million bursary cheques to more than 5,000 students.
