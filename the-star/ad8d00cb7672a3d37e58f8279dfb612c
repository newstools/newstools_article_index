Rongo residents are yet to collect more than 8,000 national ID cards. Registrar John Omeme yesterday said they have kept some for more than a year. He urged applicants to collect their cards. We are afraid the number will go up as many people have registered because of the initiatives driven by politicians and civic organisations, Omeme said.
