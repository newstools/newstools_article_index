"The committee heard that the value of the museum's land as at June 30, 2014 was Sh1.6 billion. But emerging evidence indicates several parcels of an undetermined value have been encroached upon and allocated to third parties," Keynan said. The committee also wants the National Museums of Kenya director general to put a caveat on all its land.It further wants the National Land Commission to revoke all titles for irregular allocations and restart the process of issuing them.Keynan said all parcels should be issued with titles in NM's name. The lands commission secretary is also required to update the committee on the status of the titling within the same period.
