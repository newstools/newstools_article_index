Two families in Samburu county are demanding over Sh800,000 compensation from KWS for crops and livestock lost in attacks by wild animals.They say the government is taking too long to restore their only source of livelihood.Lodokejek MCA Julius Leshoomo said on Saturday that human-wildlife conflict had continued for a long time and expressed fear that it would lead to human or wildlife deaths.He asked KWS to negotiate with the national government on behalf of the families for compensation.Samburu county's KWS warden Richard Lemarkat said the service will set traps to reduce attacks by hyenas as the government begins the process of compensating residents.But Mary Lekaato, a resident, said the government needs to find lasting solutions to curb attacks."Hyenas are still preying on animals at night. We usually hear then roaming around out compound when we are sleeping," she said.So far, well wishers have donated more than 20 sheep to the two families.Tourism county executive Peter Leshakwet said the donation was set to act as a short term reliever for the families as they await monetary compensation.About 90 per cent of Samburu county's population practice nomadic pastoralism. More recently, residents have been practicing small-scale arable farming because their livestock is increasingly under threat from predators such as lions and hyenas.But residents also say their crops are threatened by elephants and zebras.
