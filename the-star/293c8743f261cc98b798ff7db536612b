Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has accused Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu of disrespecting him by visiting his constituency without informing him.He said Waititu has formed a habit of visiting his constituency to seek votes in the Kiambu governor s race.Kuria said Waititu went too far on Sunday when he visited Wamwangi AIPCA church, only a stone s throw from Kuria s rural home, without informing him. Waititu was with Joyce Ngugi, who wants to run for Gatundu South MP against Kuria. I visit other constituencies and I always inform area MPs, but Waititu has formed a habit of visiting my constituency, attending funerals and other functions without my knowledge and in the company of my rivals a clear fact he is fighting me. He should declare whether he is fighting me or Kabogo, Kuria said in Gatundu town on Sunday.The legislator said he has tolerated Waititu, but the Kabete MP continues to provoke him.The two MPs separately attended a function in the church on Sunday, with Kuria being the first to come. But as he was taking refreshments in the church vestry, Waititu entered and was received by Ngugi s supporters.The two MPs did not meet as Kuria left for a function in Gatundu town organised by the Gatundu Matatu Owners and Drivers Sacco. Even Governor [William] Kabogo has the courtesy to inform me when he is visiting Gatundu. I don t know who Waititu thinks he is and he should stop behaving as if he has already been elected governor, Kuria said.The MP urged the matatu sacco members to increase their savings.He said he has organised a harambee in November to be presided over by Deputy President William Ruto. Proceeds will be shared according to how much a sacco has saved.The MP said he ask Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to address the problem of harassment of matatu and boda boda operators.
