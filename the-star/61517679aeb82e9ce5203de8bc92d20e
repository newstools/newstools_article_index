Government spokesman Eric Kiraithe has said the outgoing IEBC commissioners will know their individual packages before this week ends.He urged wananchi to be patient as the intergovernmental agency team determines the commissioners compensation figures.The figures were to be announced yesterday following the Friday negotiation agreement between the government and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission bosses, led by chairman Isaack Hassan. We made good progress over the weekend. Let us give them (intergovernmental team) a little time. This thing is an emergency. It is a lot of work because each person s package has to be determined, Kiraithe said.He said the team is going through documents and relating the provisions to the law in coming up with every commissioner s package.Last week, Hassan appeared before the Senate Public Accounts Committee. He said the commissioners are ready to vacate and handover to the new team. He told senators the delayed talks on their compensation and taking effect of the Election Laws providing framework for the exit are keeping them long in office.
