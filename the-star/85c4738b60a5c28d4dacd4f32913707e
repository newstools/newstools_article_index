A section of MCAs are accusing Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero of failing to implement bills, motions and petitions sent to him. Speaking during a press conference on Thursday, the reps said that the Assembly has passed a total of 23 bills since its inception but none has been implemented apart from the finance bills."Even if we come and seriously debate issues, pass bills and motions, the executive wing doesn't respect us. We are perceived as noisemakers and people who don't know what they are doing," Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto said.

But the Governor is our friend and we don't want him to victimise us," one said.Thuo said that despite the Assembly passing the motion to rename Limuru road Wangari Maathai road, the executive refused to do so and gave no explanation. In October last year, the MCAs passed a motion to rename Limuru Road after environmentalist Wangari Maathai.Thuo tabled the motion saying Maathai s passion and tireless efforts in conserving the environment should be recognised by naming the road after her.But the national and county government were quick to name Milimani road in honour of retired Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikete .The failure to implement motions and petitions has occasionally led to lack of quorum in the assembly.In August 2014, the Nairobi County Assembly suffered lack of quorum for a whole week as most MCAs kept off the chamber.The MCAs had passed a a motion on quad bikes to be used to put out fires in slums.Less than 30 MCAs were in the assembly but 43 should be present to debate and pass a motion.At the same time, Kidero's administration did not implement the motion to take quad bikes to Kibera and other slums.Also read: Kidero hosted Raila to avoid impeachment, MCA saysMCAs say they have been good at attending committee meetings in the mornings where they receive allowances but are seen loitering outside City Hall in the afternoons.Ogeto said then that they were skipping the sittings because of frustrations they go through."Coming to this assembly and taking business seriously is simply a waste of time since none of the motions we have passed has been implemented," Ogeto said.Minority whip Hashimu Kamau said the MCAs have lost morale because in the last three years, Kidero's administration has looked down upon them.
