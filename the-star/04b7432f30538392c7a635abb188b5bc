Nandi Senator Stephen Sang has written to the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Education asking him to issue a statement on the leadership crisis at Moi University.On September 19, Education CS Fred Matiang i appointed Prof Laban Ayiro acting vice chancellor to take over from the then retiring Prof Richard Mibey. He was to act for three months before a substantive VC is appointed.However, on September 20, some Rift Valley leaders stormed the university, rejecting Ayiro s appointment. They demanded that Prof Isaac Kosgey be appointed VC, saying he emerged best in the interviews for the position.Through Speaker Ekwee Ethuro, Sang asked when Matiang i will appoint a new substantive VC.The senator also wants the CS to confirm that the university council undertook and concluded the recruitment process for a new VC and forwarded the outcome to him. Through the chair of the committee, the CS should disclose the recommendation forwarded to him by the council giving details of the three top candidates, their respective scores as per the interview and why he has not acted on the same, the letter states.He also seeks to have the CS confirm to the Senate that merit is the key criterion in the appointment of vice chancellors in public universities. I also seek to know under what circumstances can a recruitment process undertaken by a council of a public university be cancelled and the process repeated, the letter says.
