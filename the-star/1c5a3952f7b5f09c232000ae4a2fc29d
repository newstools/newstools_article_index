The French Embassy has said Kenya s security has drastically improved. Deputy ambassador Kim Ramoneda said despite the apparent normalcy, there is still a lot to be done.She was speaking after visiting Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho at the weekend. Ramoneda said normalcy has led to the lifting of a travel advisory to its citizens.In May 2014, France, the UK, the US and Australia issued travel advisories forn some parts of Kenya following a string of terror attacks by al Shabaab.Last December, the French government lifted travel bans on Mombasa and Malindi tourist town in Kilifi county.Ramoneda visited Mombasa to welcome the oldest navy ship the MV Lafayette which was featured in a famous James Bond movie.She said France is now working on lifting a travel advisory for Lamu county. Security has taken a U-turn and we hope it will get better so we lift the ban on Lamu, Ramoneda said.She said Kenya needs partnerships in solving its security problems, not assistance. Ramoneda said Kenyan soldiers are training at an army camp in France.
