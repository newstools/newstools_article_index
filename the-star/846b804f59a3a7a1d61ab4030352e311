Kenya is set to host the next edition of world of music, arts and dance(Womad) festival in its efforts to build peace ahead of 2017 elections.The fete organised together with UK-based film makers, will also focus on how to change the image of Kibera as the biggest slum in Africa.Culture PS Joe Okudo said the festival, which will reserve half of the slots for local artists, will redeem the image of the slum as an election violence hot spot. Kibera deserves more from the countless tourist and NGO visits made to it, Okudo said at a meeting with Womad on Saturday.Okudo said more has been taken out of Kibera through films and fundraising initiatives compared to what has been ploughed back.Noting that this is a collaboration between Kenya and Womad, Okudo said it would be of benefit that the duo produce a national theme film.This, he said will rally Kenyans to avoid the pitfalls of the 2007/08 general elections.Okudo said the culture department will sign a memorandum of understanding with the UK team to allow half of performing artistes to be sourced internationally."Kenya will also provide free grounds for the festival at Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi," the Principal Secretary said.Womad founder Peter Gabriel said talented Kenyan artists, who will be discovered during the three-day event, will later be sponsored by the organisation. From this they will attend and perform at other festivals round the world in order to widen their exposure even as they market Kenya s cultural profile globally, he said.Gabriel said the festivals have allowed different audiences to gain an insight into cultures other than their own through music.Kenya Film Commission CEO Lizz Chongoti said the government was offering various incentives to foreign film makers to make the country more appealing as a filming destination.Artistes who have participated at past Womad festivals include Youssou N Dour, Hugh Masekela, Manu Dibango and Femi Kuti and the Drummers of Burundi (Africa).Others are; Nina Simone, Suzanne Vega, Jimmy Cliff, Burning Spear, Seu George of America and Carribean; as well as Peter Gabriel, Joe Strummer, Cara Dillon, Natacha Atlas, Estrella Morente of Europe.Womad has hosted such cultural events in 30 countries since 1980 with the aim of promoting cross-cultural awareness and tolerance through performances by some 2000 artists from 100 nations.
