The cause of the death was not immediately established.Migwani Subcounty Hospital mortuary attendants said they do not understand how the man managed to preserve the bodies for three years.The bodies were found on Friday. They were well-preserved and had no smell.Munyoki told police his wife had told him she had gone for a journey and she would return after nine years . He said she told him not to bury her. Given such instructions and putting yourself in my shoe, what would you do? he asked.Assistant chief Grace Muli said the whole village was shocked by the news. She said Munyoki does not allow visitors into the compound. He chases anybody who dares to enter into his compound, she said.Muli said she learnt of the incident after Munyoki s mother-in-law Pauline Ndunge came from Tala, Machakos county, to visit her daughter. Ndunge said she last saw her daughter in 2013.Munyoki s mother Mary Mwalale said her son had threatened to beat her after she insisted that she wanted to see Ndila. He would always tell me that my daughter-in-law had travelled to her Kangundo home, she said.The man has been living with his 15-year-old son, who does not go to school. The 15-year-old said his father told him that his mother and brother will return in nine years. The boy is being treated at Migwani hospital as he is said to have been circumcised using blunt objects. Munyoki will appear in court on Monday. What left many questions in peoples minds, is how the two died and how he preserved the bodies and kept them for so long without neighbours noticing.
