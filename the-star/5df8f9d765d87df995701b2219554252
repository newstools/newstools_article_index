It is led by career administrator Clare Omollo.The team will determine measures for forestalling future unrest and identify those responsible for the problem. It is also to audit school safety and security regulations and recommend stricter measures for high discipline standards. The team is expected to... spell out individuals who will be held responsible, including through prosecution and surcharging of suspects, Matiang i said in a statement in July. The team said it needed more time to thoroughly analyse the data it had collected since it was appointed in July, Matiang i said.The decision means a stakeholders meeting that was to take place tomorrow to discuss the committee s report has been put off indefinitely.
