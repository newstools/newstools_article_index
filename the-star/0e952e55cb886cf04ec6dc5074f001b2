Deputy President William Ruto is in Antananarivo, Madagascar, for the 19th Comesa Heads of State and Government Summit.Ruto is representing President Uhuru Kenyatta at the summit whose theme is Growing together for Prosperity.On arrival in Madagascar, Ruto was received by Prime Minister Mahafaly Solonandrasana and other senior government officials.The summit will discuss the status of implementation of the Comesa, EAC and the Southern Africa Development Community Tripartite Free Trade Area.Also to be discussed are the application by Somalia to join Comesa and the roadmap for recruitment of Comesa secretary general.Kenya is expected to request an extension of the sugar safeguard from Comesa to the country, considering the current safeguard which was granted in 2015 is due to expire in February. A critical evaluation shows despite the gains made by the sugar industry in Kenya during the period of protection, the country is still unable to compete on equal terms due to in-built structural weaknesses such as a highly fragmented land tenure system.While in Antananarivo, Ruto will lobby other Comesa countries to support the candidature of Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed for AU chairperson.
