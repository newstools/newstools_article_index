Kiambu governor William Kabogo has rubbished claims by a section of leaders from the county that he has endorsed candidates to vie for MP seats.He told residents on Monday that he has not endorsed anyone and that any candidate was free to run on any ticket including the Jubilee Party.Kabogo has cited that those spreading the said propaganda are pursuing their personal interests and are out to create enmity among the people and leaders of Kiambu."I want to speak out clearly to those who say that I have a preferred candidate. I do not have any and whoever is seeking to be elected should seek votes from the people," the governor said.He said that he has only endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to defend their seats in the 2017 general election."Those are the only two candidates I have endorsed," Kabogo said, further exuding confidence in retaining the Kiambu governor seat. Some of the leaders who Kabogo is said to have endorse include Morris Mburu, who has shown interest in the Thika Town MP seat.The seat is currently held by Alice Ng ang a who is said to be keen on defending the same in the next general election.Read: [VIDEO] Sonko, Kabogo forge alliance, pledge to show Waititu dust
