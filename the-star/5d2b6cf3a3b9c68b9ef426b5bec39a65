The directive that all Muslim women will have to remove their veil during security checks before accessing at public facilities has drawn mixed reactions from civil society and Muslim leaders.Some say they will support the move as long as the checks are conducted with respect and dignity.On Thursday, Mombasa county commissioner Evans Achoki said all women covering their faces will have to undergo serious security screening before accessing any public facility.Achoki said this will ensure security is improved and will prevent more terror attacks.This comes just few days after three women in veils were killed after attacking Central police station in Mombasa.HAKI Africa programmes officer Francis Auma said they will support the security measures as long as they do not infringe women s rights. Sins of a few people should not be paid by the entire community. But let them do it provided it is within the law and there is no harassment, Auma said.However, Kenya Muslim National Advisory Council chairman Sheikh Juma Ngao said the move is a form of victimisation of Muslim women who cover themselves as Islam demands.Ngao said he has witnessed Muslim women in veils being victimised and harassed during security checks. If they have to do it, let them do it in a manner that will not make our women feel victimised. Not everyone who is covered up is a terrorist, he said.Ngao said screening should not only be done to Muslim women but to every citizen to avoid Muslims feeling targeted.He condemned people who are misusing buibui and niqab to commit crimes in guise of fighting for their religion. Prostitutes and armed robbers are wearing buibui. This has made innocent women suffer the consequences, said Ngao.
