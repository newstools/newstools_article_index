Two men were seriously injured after they were allegedly tortured at Nchiru police station in Tigania West subcounty, Meru.Casual workers Joshua Kaberia and Douglas Karithi were on Tuesday last week arrested by an officer identified only as Mwangangi. They were accused of stealing a pig belonging to the officer s girlfriend, identified only as Kinya.Kaberia said Mwangangi handcuffed them, suspended them from the roof and beat them. They spent the night in the cell with the handcuffs on, he says. In the morning we were taken to court but I could not say a word or raise my hand, Kaberia said.He added that in the court they were rushed through a plea session and later remanded at Kangeta Prison after they failed to raise the Sh10,000 bond.Their families eventually raised the money. Tigania West police boss Joshua Opiyo said the two did not raise the issue in court and he only found out after they were released from poice custody. He said the matter will be investigated.
