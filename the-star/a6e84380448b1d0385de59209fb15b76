Nairobi county has acquired 20 bin skippers and 17 new garbage trucks as it stepped up efforts to deal with solid waste in the city.The county also plans to add 51 more trucks in the next three months to tackle the menace. Environment CEC Peter Kimori said the county has also set aside Sh50 million to repair grounded trucks."The county will also spend Sh60 million every month in paying garbage collectors," he said."Our aim is to have 210 trucks in three years. We want each ward to have at least two trucks to cut costs of hiring the same," Kimori said.Read: Solid waste to be contained within 100 days, Wakhungu says Kimori said the county has also acquired a compactor, bulldozer and excavators for the Dandora dumpsite.The plan, the official told journalists at City Hall on Friday, is to increase the waste yard's lifespan by five years."The 30 year-old dumpsite is full.We have hired a consultant, through the European Union and the World Bank to carry out a feasibility study on how the waste can be recycled," he said.Kimori said access roads to the dumpsite have been done and the trucks are now making three trips daily, compared to one trip they used to make in December.About 2500 tonnes of garbage is generated in the city each day but only 1500 is collected and deposited at the Dandora site."We are also engaging the CBOs (Community Based Organisations) to collect the garbage on our behalf. We are providing trucks for them and they only pay us Sh3,000 per truck a day," he said.City residents have complained about the heaps of uncollected garbage in the CBD, markets and residential areas.
