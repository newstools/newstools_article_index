Bungoma residents have raised concerns about the security threat posed by the increasing number of street children.They blamed them for the rise in theft, especially at night. Led by politician Walinywa Mukhamule, the residents yesterday urged Governor Kenneth Lusaka to build a shelter for more than 100 street children in the town. We have seen these boys marry their fellow street girls and get children but are still stuck on the streets. We want the Youth ministry to help them, he said.Mukhamule urged the county to employ the adult street dwellers as cleaners and security guards. There are so many things these boys can do for the county, he said.
