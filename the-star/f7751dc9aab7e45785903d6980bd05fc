Nurses kept off all public hospitals in Busia county yesterday as their strike entered its second day. The nurses are protesting against an unfulfilled return-to-work formula agreement .Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary general Seth Panyako had demanded the promotion of all staff due for advancement and whose payment of arrears was to be made on May 31. He issued a 14-day strike notice on September 26. But Health executive Maurice Siminyu said the union walked out of a meeting and proceeded to announce the strike. He said the issues raised in the strike have been tabled before and are being addressed. We had a meeting with the nurses union on Monday and their main concern is promotion. A total of 239 nurses have already been promoted. The remaining 146 will be promoted by the end of the month, Siminyu said.He urged residents to go for services in public hospitals. Please don t stop seeking services at public hospitals because of the strike. Normal services will continue until a solution with the striking nurses is reached, Siminyu said.
