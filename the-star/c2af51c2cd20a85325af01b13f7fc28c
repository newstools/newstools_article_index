Nairobi county assembly speaker Alex Magelo approved an impeachment motion against Governor Evans Kidero on Thursday.The motion drafted in August seeks Kidero's impeachment for allegedly violating the constitution and misappropriating funds.Viwandani MCA Sam Nyang wara (ODM), the sponsor of the motion, will table it in the chamber this afternoon.Read: MCAs draft motion to impeach Kidero, Speaker MageloAfter tabling, the motion will be taken to the House Business Committee that will allocate it time for debate by MCAs.The committee chaired by the speaker has seven days, according to Standing Orders (House Rules), to allocate time for the motion to be debated. The committee can even take a day to allocate time but the Standing Orders give it a week. The best thing is that the committee cannot kill it, said Nyang wara.The motion requires the support of a third of all members to be tabled. Nairobi county has 127 MCAs so it would take 87 MCAs to impeach Kidero. At least 56 Cord and Jubilee MCAs signed the petition to remove the city boss from office.Nyang wara said: "Since we joined the assembly in 2013, we have been passing budgets but have not seen anything happening in our wards. There are no tangible projects by the county government."Citing poor roads as one of the issues worth investigating, the MCA said Kidero had failed to implement the Ward Development Fund. The ward fund was stopped by the Controller of Budget.This is not the first time Kidero is facing impeachment. In September 2013, Karura MCA Kamau Thuo introduced a motion to impeach him for allegedly slapping Nairobi woman representative Rachael Shebesh.Ward representatives also tried to impeach the Governor last year after he was accused of bribing Philip Tunoi who was a judge at the Supreme Court.Kidero allegedly gave Tunoi Sh200 million so he could deliver a favourable judgment in a petition by Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu.Read: Tribunal probing Tunoi bribery allegations to hand over reportCord has 64 members while Jubilee has 63 in the Nairobi assembly. Two Cord members - South C s Diana Kapeen and Nga angwara - have since moved to the ruling coalition.If the motion goes through, Kidero will be the fifth governor to be impeached.
