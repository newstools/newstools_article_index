Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet will tour the Kerio Valley following an upsurge in bandit attacks.The violence murders, cattle theft, arson, destruction and displacement have sparked a political row among leaders in Elgeyo Marakwet county.The government has deployed 400 officers and planned security and peace meetings next week. Nkaissery and Boinnet will be present to discuss with the communities the best way forward, Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said. The two will tour before attending a major peace meeting on Friday.Murkomen defended himself over his walk-out last Friday from a charged prayer meeting in Kerio Valley, Marakwet. He said it was stage-managed to undermine him. They called it a prayer meeting but on arrival I found that it was not. That was political [event]. I am not one to politick with the lives of our people, he said in Eldoret town last Friday.The meeting was organised by churches and the county government. Murkomen flew to the venue accompanied by MPs Jackson Kiptanui (Keiyo South) and William Kisang (Marakwet West).Murkomen was confronted by angry residents, who accused him of failing to use his influence in the government to end banditry and insecurity in the Kerio Valley.The legislator said he will host a peace meeting on Saturday. Murkomen warned, however, that politicising security will not solve the problem.Residents led by Governor Alex Tolgos and former IG David Kimaiyo had marched on the Tot-Liter road to protest against unchecked violence. They travelled in 10 buses to the prayer meeting.Resident Cheserek Moinoi told Murkomen they will support the opposition if the government does not end crime. But Murkomen said it was wrong for leaders to join residents during protests against insecurity. It s embarrassing and ironical. The They should not shed crocodile tears with the community, he said.
