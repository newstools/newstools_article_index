Kiambu MCAs have criticised the one per cent rule which restricts them from tampering with the county's Sh12 billion budget. During the passing of the budget on Thursday to beat the June 30 deadline the MCAs said devolution is at risk. Section 37(1) of the Public Finance Management Act states that any increase or reduction to budget estimates should not exceed one percent of the ceiling.Many ward representatives said the law hurts MCAs' power to set and guide the budget because they have to accept do estimates set by the executive.Karuri MCA Martin Njoroge said the executive should resign. We are being forced to conduct our duties in an unconstitutional and illegal manner simply because of a regulation that has rubbished the laws, the assembly is being harassed because of a simple regulation, he said.Ting ang a MCA Lawrence Mwaura said the Appropriations Bill rejected by Governor William Kabogo should be passed with the adjustments made despite exceeding the one per cent limit.Ngewa MCA Karungo Thang wa called for the disbandment of the Budget committee for allegedlymisleading the assembly. The committee should have advised us to go to court on the matter, instead they let us waste timediscussing a matter while we were breaking laws in the process, he said.
