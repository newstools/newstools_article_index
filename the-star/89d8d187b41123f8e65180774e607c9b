Balambala MP Abdikadir Aden has criticised the Sh6.8 billion water project in Murang a county. He said it is a serious threat that will hurt many Kenyans living along the River Tana, including the people of Garissa county.Water from three rivers Irati, Gikigie and Maragwa would be diverted to Ndakaini dam through an 11.8km tunnel to increase supply to Nairobi by up to 140,000 cubic metres daily.Opposition leader Raila Odinga on Monday termed the project secret tunnels of death . He said it will disrupt the water flow of tributaries feeding River Tana. This could turn Murang a, Garissa, Ukambani and Tana Delta regions into deserts, he said.Aden said the project will dry up the Tana River. We the people of Balambala constituency (who depend on the River Tana) condemn this project and join Raila in demanding that the Jubilee government stop it with immediate effect. It should also bring to book all the persons involved in the project for violating the constitution and secretly undertaking a project with the potential of hurting many Kenyans. Aden praised Raila for telling Kenyans about the project. He said no public forums were held in the counties to be affected. This is not only unconstitutional, but also insincere of a government expected to always act in good faith of the general public, Aden said.The government has strongly defended the project and accused Raila of politicising all the programmes it implements.
