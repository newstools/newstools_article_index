Manufacturers want county governments to pass five key tax bills before the next general election to harmonise levies and cut double taxation on businesses.They are the Trade Licensing bill, Revenue Administration bill, Finance bill, Public Participation bill and Rating bill.The Kenya Association of Manufacturers said the move will bring in tune taxes, promote intra-county trade and attract investments. The experience of double taxation has continued to impede the manufacturers competitiveness in Kenya as well as in the region, KAM CEO Phyllis Wakiaga told the Star in an interview.She said uncoordinated taxes and levies have proved to be unfavourable for businesses. For instance it is so unsustainable for me to pay for vehicle branding in Nairobi county, and when I move to deliver goods in Machakos I am asked to pay for the same, she said.Wakiaga said issues such as company drivers being arrested and harassed by county officers have caused losses in millions of shillings in damaged goods and spoilt fresh produce when vehicles are impounded.In 2014, the association partnered with the Commission on Revenue Allocation in a bid to address multiplicity of licences, fees and charges. KAM has proposed gazettement of the advisory on fees and charges issued by the Transition Authority in December 2015 to ensure that there is clarity on fees and charges levied, Wakiaga said.She said there is need for the implementation of the Statutory Instruments Act, 2013, adding the guidelines were adopted by counties yet harmonisation has not been achieved. Only 30 per cent of the 47 counties have passed the laws, Wakiaga said, which translates to 14 counties.The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Kiprono Kittony said high taxes have hindered intra-county trade. He said the business community and members of the public must be involved in the formulation of budgets and taxes in the counties, to ensure their views are captured.Kenya lost giant factories and flower firms to regional investor-friendly countries due to high costs of operation. Early this month, tyre maker Sameer announced that it will shut its Nairobi factory tomorrow citing cheap imports that make it uncompetitive because of the high cost of production locally. Others that have closed shop over the last two years include chocolate firm Cadbury and battery maker Eveready.Naivasha-based giant flower farm Oserian plans to sack 400 workers citing low demand for the commodity from Europe and high production costs.The Kenya Flower Council said earlier this year that most flower farm companies are relocating to Ethiopia where the business policies favour investors.
