Detectives in Changamwe have recovered a Ceska pistol, with seven bullets, which they believe was stolen from police officers murdered in the area in 2013.The pistol was left behind by a suspected thug who escaped from a mob that wanted him to lynch him. He had attempted to steal from an M-Pesa shop at Portreitz in Changamwe. A witness told the Star that the suspect, who is believed to be a notorious criminal, dropped the weapon after he was overwhelmed by the mob."He escaped before Administration Police officers on patrol arrived. He could have injured us with the weapon since police were late," said the witness who declined to be named.Area CID boss Francis Wanjahu said they took the firearm to ballistics experts who will establish its owner."We strongly believe it is a police gun. The suspect is a young man who has committed several crimes. Our officers are on the ground; he will be arrested," Wanjahu said.He urged members of the public to remain vigilant and give police helpful information.OCPD Hezborn Otieno, OCS Salim Kimutai, police officers Stephen Maithya and Andrew Songwa were killed by suspected MRC members on March 3, 2013.Two Ceska pistols and two AK47 assault rifles were stolen from them,On July 29, judge Martin Muya sentenced two Mombasa Republican Council members - Jabiri Ali Dzuya and Bwanamkuu Alwan - to death for the attack.Muya delivered the ruling after finding them guilty of killing the police officers on the eve of that year's general election.Two others who had been connected tot he case - Badi Said and Omar Salim - were set free.
