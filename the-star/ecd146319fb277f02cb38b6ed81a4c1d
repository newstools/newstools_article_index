Accelerate to Excellence, a global management consultancy affiliated to Australia Africa Energy and Minerals Institute, has set up shop in Kenya to increase skills in the nascent oil and gas industry. The firm is targeting the public and private sector players interested in the extractive process. Once people realise the scope and significance of these courses and what they could mean not just for the trainees but the entire oil, gas and mining industry, I believe it could become a national model, AAEMI s trainer on finance and accounting Adam Bick said.
