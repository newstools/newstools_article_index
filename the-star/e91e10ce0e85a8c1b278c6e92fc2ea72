MCA hopeful Geoffrey Nyungu yesterday accused Mt Elgon MP John Serut (pictured) of threatening to shoot him for criticising his leadership.He said Serut threatened him on Saturday in Mukuyuni village, Kabuchai constituency. But Serut said he only asked Nyungu why he went to court to stop formation of the CDF committee, delaying bursaries. I don t own a gun and I never threatened to shoot him. That is seeking cheap publicity, he said.
