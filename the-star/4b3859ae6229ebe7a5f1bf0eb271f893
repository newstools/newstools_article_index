They include an increase of the medical cover, mortgage and car loans scheme and education incentives for at least two children.The new demands are in addition to the earlier demand by Kuppet for a 200 per cent salary increase for teachers. Knut has made a 300 per cent salary increase demand alongside other allowances.Misori said, We met with TSC but there was no counter-offer yet. They told us they have to analyse the contents of our demands and decide by October 19, Misori said. We are confident that we shall finish the negotiation and sign the Collective Bargaining Agreement before end of October. The comprehensive teachers medical cover was managed by AoN Insurance Brokers Kenya for Sh5.3 billion.
