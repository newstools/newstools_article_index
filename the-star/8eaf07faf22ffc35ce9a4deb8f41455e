A talking three-month old baby has sent shock waves through Bilaa B village in Tongaren constituency, Bungoma county.Residents flocked to Patrick Wasike and his wife Salome Wangila's home to see the baby said to verbally express feelings such as hunger and the need to relieve herself.They asked elders to look into the case of baby Joy Wangila as such has never happened in the village.Wangila told journalists at their home on Saturday that she was also shocked that her first child, who was born healthy, started speaking at a tender age.''My child just says words... When she wants to eat something she asks for it. If you refuse to give it to her she begins to cry,'' she said.Babies sometimes say their first words at nine months of age, and construct sentences between one and a half years and two months.Manea Namaemba, the child's grandmother, said Joy spoke for the first time on August 2."The mother wanted to breastfeed her but she demanded porridge," said Namaemba."She spoke again while I was digging for potatoes for lunch. A neighbour came and asked for the potatoes and the child told her not to eat anything from this home."She said the baby left them in "total shock".Joy's grandmother said she has not stopped talking since then and asks for milk, porridge and to breastfeed.
