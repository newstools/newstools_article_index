However, he said, Jubilee shelved these plans."We agreed [that] Mombasa, Kilifi and Kisumu would serve as economic zones, but up to now Jubilee have ignored [this]," he said.He maintained that if he wins the presidential bid, he would immediately address the issue of land injustices and youth unemployment.Raila said in his Eldoret tour he met with residents who regretted voting in the Jubilee administration."They have told me the coalition government was far much better than the current regime. Maize prices have gone down, fertilizer has hiked, sugar and other commodities are very expensive. This is the exploitation I will address once I become president," he said.Raila also paraded his youthful leaders within the ODM party to counter DP William Ruto's remarks that he was not giving youthful leaders a chance.Mombasa governor Hassan Joho, Chairman John Mbadi, Agnes Zani, Opiyo Wandayi were among those cheered as ODM's youth league.This comes as sources say MPs present in the rally are dramming up support for Joho to Odinga's running mate.
