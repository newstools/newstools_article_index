State House will respond to questions raised during the ongoing summits hosted by President Uhuru Kenyatta by the end of the week. We want to reassure them that we expect issues and questions raised during the Energy, Infrastructure, Agriculture, Tourism and Health summits to be responded to in full by the close of this week, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said.He said Youth Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki promised that questions directed to her would be responded to in 15 days. So there is still another week to go on that one. We welcome the strong participation by Kenyans in the State House summits we have hosted the last couple of weeks, through broadcast, print and digital platforms, Esipisu said.Next week, State House is expected to host a summit on governance and accountability, where the government will tackle, among other issues, corruption.The Jubilee government has been using the summits to apprise the country on the progress made in various sectors.
