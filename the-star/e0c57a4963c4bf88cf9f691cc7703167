Lamu county has set aside Sh34.9 million in this year s budget for tea and mandazi which will be served to various departments.The county budget says Sh8.9 million has been allocated to tea for the office of Governor Issa Timamy. Some Sh6.9 million was allocated to the same at the county assembly.Residents have expressed shock over the allocations to food, saying the county has more pressing matters to deal with.They felt the money should have been diverted to the health sector, that is to improve dire condition of dispensaries and hospitals across the county."We would like the money used to improve dispensaries like those that were vandalised by terrorists in Lamu East have," said resident Ali Godana."Many hospitals do not have drugs and we have to make expensive purchases at chemists yet people are taking tea worth millions."Locals also feel some of the money should have been used to buy dialysis machines for kidney patients who have to go to Mombasa and Nairobi for the services."How expensive can tea and mandazi get in this county? Can someone explain why the Governor can allow such massive misappropriation and yet he is always saying he cannot steer development because Lamu gets little money?" asked resident Ali Musadiffa."How about these millions going to tea alone? It is not about the amount allocated by government; it is the wisdom to put to use the little you claim to have been given. Timamy has failed."Residents suspect large amounts of money have been misappropriated. They asked the Auditor General to tour the county and assess budget allocations.More than 30,000 residents in various parts of the county are staring at starvation following a prolonged dry spell.On September 29, Lamu residents questioned why the assembly set aside Sh670,000 to buy coffins. They said the allocation was funny and suspicious and that there was more to it than met the eye.The county was allocated Sh2.6 billion for financial year 2016-17.Read more: Lamu sets aside Sh670,000 to buy coffinsTimamy said in July that he would not approve this year's budget until he reaches an agreement with MCAs.He was also opposed to the Sh406 million vote on account budget the MCAs passed recently, adding that it was approved out of selfishness.
