The high cost of education has led to massive dropouts, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi said yesterday. Free basic education in Kenya is an illusion as long as parents shoulder the burden of costs of running schools. The delusion that government owns or funds schools is a lie perpetuated through connivance, he said.Mudavadi spoke at the release of ANC s education policy paper. He accused the Jubilee administration of making education the preserve of the well-to-do. Despite the government issuing guidelines on school fees, and subsidies of Sh13,365 per student per year, some schools charge up to Sh100,000 per student in fees. Do you call that free secondary [school] education? At primary level, government subsides are an embarrassing Sh1,200 per year per child, Mudavadi said. He promised to devolve education if elected. However, the national government will retain policy, quality assurance, teacher training, recruitment and assignment. Mudavadi proposed transforming education into a comprehensive free basic education sector by abolishing all levies and scrapping the KCPE and KCSE exams.
