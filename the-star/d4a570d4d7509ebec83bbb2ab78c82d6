[so] we can not allow the Governor to go free after destroying property that has cost taxpayers money to put up," Marwa said.He said Joho will be arrested and charged with criminal offence.But the Governor maintained that the disputed piece of land belonged to the defunct Mombasa Municipal Council.The land had been used as a dump site by the county before the wall was built around it last year.
