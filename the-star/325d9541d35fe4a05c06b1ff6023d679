Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi is facing an arduous task in his bid for a third term. Already, five aspirants have declared interest. They include businessman Japheth Nyakundi, James Atandi, Kisii county director of Special Programmes Patrick Chogo and politician Stephen Nyarangi. Chogo finished second in the March 4, 2013, general election.Yesterday, Nairobi advocate Ogamba Migosi indicated he may join the race, complicating politics for Angwenyi, who will run on the Jubilee Party ticket. I have received several delegations of community leaders who want me to contest. My message to them is that I have to consult widely with other stakeholders, including fellow aspirants and the larger community, he said.Migosi, who ran in 2007, spoke after meeting 50 community leaders. There is a general opinion in the constituency that he (Angwenyi) has failed. He is not doing enough. We want to approach this election with a clear vision and strategy, he said.Clan politics, performance of the incumbent and political party affiliation will largely determine the election s outcome. ODM and the Jubilee Party are the most popular parties in Kisii.
