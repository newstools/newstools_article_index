Cord leaders Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetangula (Ford K) have dismissed claims of disunity among them.They said the insinuation of a discord in the coalition is a creation of sections of the media being used to propel propaganda initiated by their political rivals.The opposition leaders said those spreading the false claim that will break before the 2017 polls only fear their presidential bid.They said the coalition is united and strong, further adding they will continue working together 'to liberate the country from bad leadership'.Raila, who was seen candidly conversing with former Lands CS Charity Ngilu, said they will invite other leaders to form a super coalition that will oust Jubilee at the ballot.The signal was also given by Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi at a separate function where he received defectors to the party.Read: Mudavadi 'ready to be Cord flagbearer' in 2017 presidential raceThe leaders, who attended the burial of CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti's husband, the late Henry Oduwole burial at Kinanie, Mavoko sub-county, reiterated that they will stick together."We are together as Cord principals. That is the reason all of us are here together today," Raila said.Raila likened the coalition to River Nile adding that nothing will deter it from taking over leadership from Jubilee administration."We will not disintegrate. We are like the Nile which cannot be stopped from flowing to Egypt," he said, and invited women leaders to take up roles in the coalition.He dared those who want to defect to do so, adding that they have the requisite numbers that will easily replace those who abandon the course."We will work together will all women," Raila said, mentioning CCU leader Wavinya Ndeti and Ngilu.Kalonzo said Cord will ensure women get equal representation if it forms the next government after the 2017 polls."We know where we want to take the country. We are going to that direction and nothing will stop us," the Wiper leader said.Read: I ll back Wetang ula or Raila if they are picked Wetangula said the country has been taken hostage by corrupt cartels who can only be dismantled when the opposition takes over.
