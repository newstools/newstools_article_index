The judiciary has withdrawn its medical insurance scheme for all judges and junior staff over alleged misuse of funds.In a memo seen by the Star, it informed its staff that it has terminated its services with the Jubilee Insurance Company and will look for an alternative by November.According to the memo dated October 3, the decision was taken after a meeting between judiciary s chief registrar Anne Amadi and officials of an association grouping judicial staff. I make reference to our memo dated 29th and 30th September on the above matter. As promised therein we indicated we would have a meeting with the Kenya Judiciary Staff Association officials to chart the way forward on the judiciary medical scheme to ensure that our staff access reasonable medical services as per our resources, reads the memo. Amadi said the meeting resolved that the present medical insurance contract with Jubilee Insurance be terminated. She said a termination notice has already been sent to the insurer and will take effect from November 2.During the intervening period, Jubilee Insurance will continue providing services until November 2. We ask for patience from all our staff as the management works towards ensuring that an appropriate and acceptable arrangement is in place from November 3, Amadi said.Last month, the judiciary imposed restrictions on the scheme to curb misuse of funds and cut down on huge hospital bills. Staff were stopped from using high-end hospitals, but given leeway to get unlimited outpatient services across the board.The allocation was reduced from Sh150,000 to Sh75,000 for individuals seeking maternity services. The staff will access dental and optical services at designated clinics and specific doctors.
