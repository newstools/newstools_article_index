Kipruto won the Olympic title in his first attempt during the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and is now focused on carrying on with the rich form. After the Olympics, Kemboi told me take over and I am ready to do that, said Kipruto during the launch of the 2016 Ndalat Gaa cross country at Riadha House yesterday. The race is set for October 15. I want to be a great steeplechaser like him whether at the Olympics or at the World Championships. Ezekiel has been a great steeplechaser and he remains my hero in steeple. He has also revealed that he will continue his attempt for the world record one of his major focus for the forthcoming season. My attempt at the world record in Brussels (Diamond League Meeting) never turned out as expected for two reasons: the pace maker and my body could not respond like during the Olympics. I think I over-trained for the record, said Kipruto. I will take a little rest to take care of my businesses and when the new season comes, I will concentrate on the world record and the World Championships in London. The two remain my priority. I want that world steeplechase gold since I already have two silvers and I feel the world record is well within my reach, he added.In a career spanning about six years, Kipruto has proved to be the next water and barrier runner.Starting his international career with a World Youth title capture at the 2011 championships in Lille, France, Kipruto has gone on to win the World Junior title in Spain in 2012, placed second at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Russia and at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, China before capturing the Olympic title in an Olympic record of 8:03.28 last August.
