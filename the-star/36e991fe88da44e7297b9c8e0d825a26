Likuyani MP Enock Kibunguchy has said that Ford Kenya will accept nothing else in Cord other than being nominated the coalition's presidential flag bearer or running mate.Kibunguchy said on Wednesday that the party will have no option but to present its own presidential candidate if it misses the two slots during the coalition primaries."We know that we have the strength across the country and we are going for nothing less that the top two slots, failure to which we stand on our own as Ford Kenya and go it alone," he said."Cord captain Raila Odinga has tried thrice and he is a good general but it is time he gave way," he said during an interview at Likuyani CDF office. He said that Raila should front the pair of Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang ula (Ford Kenya) for the 2017 general elections and remain the main striker.Read: Ford Kenya endorses Wetang'ula for presidency in 2017Also read: We will not dissolve Ford Kenya for single party under Cord - MPs This comes after Wetang ula said two months ago that Raila cannot win the next general elections, citing that crowds do not translate into votes.Kibunguchy was elected to parliament on ODM ticket in 2013 but defected a year ago to Ford Kenya following differences with deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya.Raila has said he is ready to support any other candidate if that will guarantee opposition victory.But his close allies and Luo elders council insist that he will be on the ballot come August 8, 2017 as the best bet for the opposition.Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale on Wednesday said that Ford Kenya supports plans to register Cord as a corporate party.He said that Cord presidential contestants be subjected to join nomination process where the winner flies the Cord flag and the runners up becomes his running mate.He said that Ford Kenya supports an arrangement where the third principal will have a negotiated position reserved for him in the Cord government.Kibunguchy asked Tongaren MP Eseli Simiyu and his Kiminini counterpart Chris Wamalwa to resolve their differences as they could be used by opponents to wreck the party.
