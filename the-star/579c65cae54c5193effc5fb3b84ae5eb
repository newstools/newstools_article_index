Two women found guilty of undergoing Female Genital Mutilation were on Wednesday put on one year probation by a Kilgoris Court.Emmy Ng eno, 21, and Priscah Sigei, 23, were accused of having jointly failed to report the commission of FGM that had knowingly been committed on them.Ng eno, a mother of two, and Sigei who is a mother of one are said to have committed the offence on November 27, 2015 at Kapsinendet Village in Trans Mara East Sub County, Narok County.The two women pleaded guilty to the charges and in mitigation, asked the court to be lenient to them.They said they did not undergo FGM on their own volition but due to constant pressure from their age mates who considered them not to be 'women enough'."We were looked down upon by our fellow women who considered us to be children despite being married. They despised us to an extent of isolating us from community activities which forced us to undergo FGM in order to fit in the society," Sigei told the court.In his ruling, senior resident magistrate Robert Oanda said the practice is against the law and those who condone it should face the consequences."This court has considered that the two women are young mothers and have been in remand since they were arrested last year and it has therefore decided to put them on one year probation," Oanda added.
