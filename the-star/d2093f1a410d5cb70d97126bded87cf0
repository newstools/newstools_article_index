Electricity supply has been restored at Murang a GK Prison following security concerns by wardens.Kenya Power disconnected supply over delayed payments amounting to Sh500,000.It is not clear whether the bill was cleared but officer-in-charge Billy Koshial told the Star the supply was restored on Monday evening.The prison's administration had complained that they were forced to use lanterns and torches to light the facility. They said the darkness posed a security threat."We would have such a hard time if prisoners decided to take advantage of the darkness to attempt escaping," said a warden who declined to be named.The wardens also said they had struggled to maintain peace and security at the facility, and had liaised with Kenya Prisons Service for the power to be reconnected.The facility currently holds about 550 male and 70 female inmates.Many of the wardens had opted to apply for individual power connection at their quarters."It is unfair that we were forced to start paying our water and power bills yet the government is supposed to pay as there is an allocation," one said.It is said the disconnection was occasioned by delays by Treasury to release funds, and that majority of the prisons countrywide were affected.Read: No electricity at Naivasha prison, staff houses over Sh6 million billAlso read: Water shortage hits Naivasha GK prison over Sh2m power debtThe prison was forced to use temporary sources of power last October after electricity was disconnected over arrears amounting to Sh550,000.
