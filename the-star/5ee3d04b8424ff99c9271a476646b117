Some 500 supporters of Kajiado Central MP Elijah Memusi of ODM decamped to the Jubilee Party on Monday in Dalalekutuk ward in support of politician Anthony Kiroken (pictured).Kiroken said he is not a government project. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to keep off Kajiado Central and let him face Memusi alone.Kiroken said it is the will of his voters that he faces the opposition without the support of the ruling party. He lost to Memusi in the March 16, 2015, by-election. Memusi, who was in Jubilee during nominations, defected to ODM, where he was given a direct ticket. The government spent a lot of resources on the by-election.The seat fell vacant after Joseph Nkaissery of ODM was appointed Interior CS to replace Joseph ole Lenku.
