The Ministry of Labour has called a meeting over the strike by Kenya Airways staff, as KQ said things have improved with over 65 flights yesterday.However, some flights were cancelled and others delayed due to shortage of cabin crew.CS Philis Kandie will host talks among the various parties "to seek an amicable settlement on the issues that gave rise to the KQ strike notice".The separate meetings involving conciliation committee members, staff union representatives, KQ management as well as Cotu and Federation of Kenya Employers will take place at the ministry boardroom from 9am.The cancelled flights were KQ600 to Mombasa, KQ432 to Kilimajaro, KQ350 to Juba, KQ706 to Lusaka and Harare and KQ740 to Maputo. KQ782 to Livingston and Cape Town was delayed."Several outsourced crew have not reported to work as per schedule," Kenya Airways said in a statement on Sunday. KQ said as per the safety regulations the minimum number of cabin staff per aircraft type is required."And on some of our flights we are unable to reach these levels. Despite our effort to solve the problem by combining several flights, we have made the difficult decision to cancel," it said.The airline said some of their outsourced staff including cabin crew stayed away from work from Friday and have not yet returned."We are working with their employer to resolve any issues they may have," the airline said.The airline apologised for the inconvenience caused and guests on cancelled flight adding "guests will be re-booked on later flights or alternative airlines."But on Sunday evening, Kenya Airways announced that its operations had returned to normalcy and 67 flights taken off as at 4pm.The airline said all evening flights are expected to operate as planned.KQ threatened to stop selling tickets on its network if the pilots union does not retract a strike notice issued after another flight delay.Sources also told the Star the cabin crew downed their tools citing poor relations with management and poor medical benefits.Read: State asks pilots to call off planned strike, warns of serious consequencesRead: The challenge of turning around Kenya AirwaysAlso read: Kenya Airways bosses cannot end loss-making streak, says pilots union
