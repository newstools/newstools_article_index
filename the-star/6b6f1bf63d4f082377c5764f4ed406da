The Devolution ministry has asked governors to allocate more resources to development for the country to achieve Vision 2030.A report on expenditure from the ministry recommended this after it emerged that recurrent costs have exceeded cash set aside for projects.The ministry's economic report for 2016, says the approved 2014/15 budget allocations for recurrent and development costs stood at 62 and 38 per cent respectively.But by the end of the said financial year, only 22 per cent of actual spending was spent on development."Recurrent expenditure has grown much faster, reflecting high administrative costs largely related to county executives and county assemblies," says the report tabled before MPs went on recess.County expenditure during the period under review was against the Sh318 billion total revenue from the national government, that was shared equitably among the 47 of them.Read: County cash must go to service deliveryAlso read: Kiuru residents raise cash to repair dilapidated road ignored by countyThe budgetary allocation included Sh284 billion equitable share, Sh1.87 billion conditional grant, Sh32 billion local revenue and Sh0.7 billion donor grants.The report further shows total expenditure amounted to Sh258 billion with Sh168 billion going to recurrent and Sh90 billion on development while Sh4.2 billion of this allocation was carried forward.It shows about 10 counties reached the targeted 30 per cent expenditure on development.They are Turkana, Bomet, Machakos, Murang'a, Homa Bay, West Pokot, Trans Nzoia, Kisii and Nyamira.But majority of the counties spent less than the average of 22 per cent of development. This may affect their delivery of core services."Development spending is low and counties will largely depend on the national government to initiate development projects," it says.
