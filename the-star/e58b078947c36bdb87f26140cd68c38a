Environmentalists, human rights organisations and Kaya elders in Kwale have raised the red flag over destruction of the historical Kwale Baraza Park.The Kwale government is rehabilitating the natural park for Sh30 million. Kaya elders stopped the construction of a recreational facility in the park last week, saying they were not informed why the structure was being put up.Led by Abdallaha Kushindwa, the elders said putting up structures in the park will attract grabbers, who are already trying to encroach on the green. The park was once used by Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.Addressing journalists after a meeting with Kwale county officials, Kushindwa said after consulting widely, they will communicate their decision on Monday.The meeting was attended by county secretary Martin Mwaro, Culture executive Patrick Mtsami, Land chief officer Mohamed Pakia, Matuga subcounty administrator Nimusimu Mwasina and Tsimba Golini ward administrator Mishi Mayumbe. We will meet the officials again on Monday because they have clearly explained to us about the project, Kushinda said. He said they are trying to reclaim all grabbed pieces.
