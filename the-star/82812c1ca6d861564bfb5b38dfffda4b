The 2016-2017 Kenya Cup season will be shortened from 25 to 19 weeks according to Kenya Rugby Union director of fixtures Musa Ndale.This follows an uproar over the length of the season with clubs and stakeholders fearing players will burnout.In a raft of changes following consultation with the 12 contesting teams, Ndale said the teams will be split into two conferences with teams playing each other, as well as cross over matches for 15 matches. The remaining three weeks will factor in playoffs and finals.There are proposals for the league to have quarterfinals , semifinals and final similar to last season with the top six teams qualifying for the playoffs at the end of the season. The teams finishing first and second will have home ground advantage in the semifinals.The league will now start on November 5 instead of October 22 as earlier planned and end in May.Ndale said they had taken into consideration the proposals to have a balanced season and to reduce player workload. Having a 25 week season means we are playing for six months which will not be tenable. So we have cut it down by six weeks to ensure our players are fresh, fit and well conditioned to handle the rigours of international rugby Ndale added.A new set of fixture is set to be released in upcoming weeks.Elsewhere Homeboyz new signing Charles Omondi has been ruled out for six months with a leg injury sustained at the Christie Sevens last month.Homeboyz head coach Paul Murunga confirmed Omondi will be out of the soon to start Kenya Cup till March 2016 with his earliest participation set to come in April. Though he rues Omondi's absence, Murunga is consoled by the numbers on his side as the Kenya Cup season draws close.
