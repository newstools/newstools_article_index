The Bank of England will probably wait until August to make any policy move to offset the hit to the economy from Britain's decision to leave the European Union, but the pound has more pain ahead, a Reuters polls showed on Tuesday.Governor Mark Carney has said the economy faces a material slowdown after the shock referendum result and the BoE took steps on Tuesday to encourage banks keep lending.One Reuters poll showed sterling - which sank to a new 31-year low against the dollar on Tuesday - would probably weaken by a further 3 per cent on top of the 12 per cent drop already since the June 23 vote, less than two weeks ago.Reuters polls before the referendum predicted a significant slide in sterling as well as the kind of economic pain that the BoE is bracing for with its abrupt shift in stance.After spending most of first three years at the Bank trying to signal when the BoE was likely to raise rates, Carney last week suggested more stimulus was likely over the summer as the referendum result raised fears of a possible recession.But it is debatable how much impact an additional cut to rates, which are already at a record low of 0.50 per cent, will have on an economy facing lower investment, spending and potential trouble in Britain's expensive property markets."In our view, a rate cut in the coming months would be largely futile, however it does appear a very real possibility," said Oliver Jones, an economist at Fathom Consulting."The Monetary Policy Committee also seems likely to restart quantitative easing, with a possible expansion of the scope. Purchasing corporate bonds would be the most effective of the Bank's options."Nearly two-thirds of 52 economists in a second Reuters poll said Bank Rate would remain steady at next week's meeting which concludes on July 14. Seventeen predicted a cut to 0.25 per cent and another two saying rates will be chopped to zero next week.Median forecasts show a single cut to 0.25 per cent by the end of the July-September quarter, by which time the economy is expected to be slowing even more. Most economists said Bank Rate would stay at 0.25 per cent until the end of next year.The BoE is due to come up with fresh forecasts for the economy on August 4 and it has traditionally timed big policy moves to coincide with those quarterly reports.By the time of its August meeting, the BoE will have a better idea of the referendum result's impact on the economy.Overall economic growth in the April-June period probably already slowed to just 0.2 per cent in the quarter, according to financial data firm Markit, which publishes closely watched purchasing managers' indexes.Asked more broadly how the BoE was likely to respond to Brexit, a majority of economists who answered the question thought a combination of lower rates and more asset purchases, or quantitative easing (QE), was likely.The BoE first launched purchases of government bonds in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, adding 375 billion pounds to the central bank's balance sheet, about one-fifth of UK economic output. It has not made purchases for four years.More on this story
