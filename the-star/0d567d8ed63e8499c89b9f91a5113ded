The Jubilee Party leadership has been asked to reprimand fighting leaders as they embarrass the President and party founders. Mt Kenya Youth Caucus chairman Linford Mutembei on Sunday said the mistrust among members and undercutting to outdo each other is worrying. It is shameful for leaders to start fighting for positions so early and is not a good sign for a vehicle to be used by the President and Deputy President for their reelection, he said.Mutembei urged the youth to be wary of politicians involved in premature campaigns. Caucus secretary general Stephen Karanja said Jubilee should take action against members inciting people to violence and even deny them certificates of contesting in elections to tame them. Last week, Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi said, The kind of indiscipline and disorder we have seen is not what the President and his deputy had in mind when they formed the Jubilee Party. He added, All Jubilee supporters should shun anybody propagating violence.
