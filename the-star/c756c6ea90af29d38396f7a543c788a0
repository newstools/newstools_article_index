Two chiefs and six assistant chiefs from the Solio Settlement Scheme who were being administered from Nyeri county will now take orders from Laikipia county.Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri, Laikipia county commissioner Chege Mwangi and Kieni East deputy county commissioner James Chacha on Thursday presided over the handover ceremony of the administrators. This is after the IEBC said Solio is in Laikipia, although the national administrative boundaries defined the area as part of Nyeri county.The national government, through the Interior ministry, directed authorities in Nyeri to handover the administrators and the region to Laikipia county.The Mathingira and Bahati locations administrators were initially answerable to the Kieni East deputy county commissioner in Nyeri county, since more than 15,000 squatters were resettled in the scheme in 2009.
