Teachers unions have urged the TSC to expedite payment of city housing allowances. Kuppet Kisumu executive secretary Zablon Awange and Knut Kisii South executive secretary Geoffrey Mogire said teachers in cities should not be discriminated against.The city house allowance is paid to certain job groups. Currently teachers in job group M get Sh19,000. The officials threatened to mobilise teachers for a nationwide strike if the TSC does not honour their demand. They spoke during the Teachers Lake Region Open day at Tom Mboya Labour College on Wednesday. Mogire questioned the criteria the commission uses to pay teachers in Nyanza. If MM Shah and Arya primary schools in Kisumu city share a fence and teachers in Arya are receiving city house allowance while their neighbours do not get allowances, then which criteria is the TSC using? he said. Mogire said teachers in Kisumu, Nairobi, Eldoret and Mombasa deserve bigger allowances to cope with the high cost of living in the cities.
