Former Cabinet minister Margaret Kamar (pictured) has withdrawn from the Uasin Gishu governor race and opted to run for the Senate seat instead. She made the announcement on Sunday at AIC Tebeson in Maili Nne, Eldoret town. I will stand for senator and not governor as I did in 2013. I want to ensure county funds are well utilised, she said.
