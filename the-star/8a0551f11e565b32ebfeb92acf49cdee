The Kwale residents meeting with Mining CS Dan Kazungu over Base Titanium s exploration licence was a public relations scheme by Jubilee, two ODM leaders have said.Residents complain the firm is mining minerals in new areas without their consent or that of the Kwale government.Nominated MP Zuleikha Juma and Kwale speaker Sammy Ruwa said the meeting left more questions than answers. They said the CS first met Governor Salim Mvurya alone before attending the meeting.Mvurya selected those who would ask selected questions about the mining, and dissenters were not allowed to ask questions, they said.
