Six students of the Cooperative University College of Kenya have returned to the Nairobi-based university to be employed as farmers. The six Bachelor of Commerce graduates now till land at the university's four-acre model farm, where they are growing pawpaws and tomatoes. But these are not your typical farmers.The project, piloted by the Faculty of Commerce, is serving as a model for replication by agribusiness practitioners, learners and other small-scale agribusiness farmers. It started with an initial capital of Sh1.5 million. It is now expected to act as an entrepreneurial spark, and help students learn how to start a business, grow it, manage the human resources, make use of available resources and assets and further inculcate in them a culture of job creation.Dr Kennedy Kirima, who heads the department of commerce, said that the farm has employed six former students and is already supplying tomatoes and capsicum to internal and external markets. Once they equip themselves with the right skills, the students hope to go and launch their own farms."On the farm, we are growing pawpaws, tomatoes, coriander, capsicum, cow-peas and kales which we will be supplying the university college for its internal uses and the neighboring markets in large scale sales," Kirima says.He says the project is projected to grow into a multi-million agribusiness venture in the next two years. It is also hoped to fund a large part of the faculty's expenses and supplement the university's other sources of revenue.The university college's principal, Prof Douglas Shitanda, said the are targeting to train not only students but also farmers aligned to cooperatives."We are targeting to train farmers from different regions of this country on how to make money out of agriculture, train them to form cooperatives and how to add value the goods they grow," the Principal told the Star.He said the institution set up the farm to encourage students become entrepreneurs. The project will also be used to train small-scale farmers."The cooperative model is a sure way to fighting poverty and by starting this farm we are targeting agri-based cooperatives to integrate agribusiness as a venture towards strengthening their cooperatives, he said.Recently, the university got into a memorandum of understanding with the World Council of Credit Unions where the two institutions will cooperate on financial education among other areas.The university will also charge a small fee to farmers who want to learn the basics and concepts of agribusiness.Crops and food grown in the farm will offset expenses for the institution, because some of the food harvested from the farm will go into students' meals, Prof Shitanda said. The university is also looking forward to engaging with various stake holders especially the county governments in training farmers from all the 47 counties, he says.Chris Oderi, the farm manager, says that the business is good and they are planning to add the number of employees.The institution is now calling upon the county governments to embrace agribusiness as a way of fighting joblessness among youths.Since this was started as a pilot project, the institution is planning to channel more funds and expand the project to make it large scale."With green house technology, we are not controlled by the weather, either the rains come or they don't come, we will still be in good farming business," says Oderi.He also encourages youths fresh from university not only to look for employment but to create employment through agribusinesses.The encouragement comes as a recently released report showed that Kenya is losing momentum in farming, as poor countries like Malawi invest more and show impressive growth.The report, released at the just-ended Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (Agra) forum, said Kenyan agriculture registered an annual growth of less than three per cent in productivity in 2005-2012. Cooperative University hopes its investment in farming will also help lift Kenya's agriculture sector.The 2016 African Agriculture Status Report said countries that made the biggest investments were rewarded with sizeable improvement and overall economic performance. Poverty rates are declining in countries such as Ghana, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, but not in others, it states.Kenya devotes less than 10 per cent of its budget to agriculture, against the AU s recommendation. The report, titled 'Progress Towards an Agriculture Transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa', says much of Africa enjoyed sustained productivity increase since 2005.But it was greatest in countries that moved quickly to adopt the AU s Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), which calls for at least 10 per cent of the budget to go to agriculture.According to the Agra report, even though countries did not hit the 10 per cent targets, early adopters of the CAADP goals realised improved productivity on existing farmlands. This rose from 5.9 to 6.7 per cent per year. The early adopters are Benin, Burundi, Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Togo.Meanwhile, farm productivity of countries that did not go that route rose by less than 3 per cent and their GDP by only 2.2 per cent, it says. The evidence is clear. When we invest in our farmers and in all we need to succeed, good things happen across the economy, Agra president Agnes Kalibata said.Kenya s farming sector lately has seen fads run by urban residents interested in quick money schemes, such as the failed quail farming. The report says rush by urban residents into farming is a double-edged sword.
