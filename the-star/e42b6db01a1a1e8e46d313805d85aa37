They are preparing to leave. Some are clearing out, a source at Anniversary Towers said.At least two commissioners have surrendered their official vehicles and have been reporting to duty using private means of transport.The meeting will receive a closely guarded exit budget from the commission, but will have the latitude to agree on a number of parameters, including gratuity and settlement of the salaries and allowances for the period to be forfeited by the commissioners early exit.After a deal on the exit settlement is reached, the commissioners will write to the President to formally tender their resignation following a mutual agreement with the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on the IEBC.
