Isaac Kithi alias Livingstone's family was overjoyed when he returned to his Jilore home in Malindi subcounty on Tuesday, after disappearing for 26 years.The mentally ill man was reunited with his family in an emotional ceremony after he was found in Burundi five months ago, thanks to social media.Kithi's mother was joined by family members and hundreds of villagers who jammed his home to give him a heroic welcome. They last saw him in May 1990 when he was taken by an uncle to Port Reitz hospital in Mombasa after he became mentally ill.Then in form two at Jilore High School, the 17 year-old reportedly escaped the hospital three days after his admission, never to be seen again.Family members searched for the "then bright, hardworking and youthful boy" but lost hope he would ever return and even doubted if he was still alive.Burundi police found Kithi loitering in a village; it is still not clear how he got there and how he survived. The officers took him to the Kenyan embassy which posted his photographs on Facebook. They were later shared on various WhatsApp groups.Thoya Iha, an official at the embassy in Burundi who is a resident of Magarini, helped in searching for his family.Iha said Kithi told him he walked to the the country but unconfirmed reports indicated he may have used long-distance trucks.He said Kithi disclosed to him after he was taken to the embassy by Burundi police and a chief on May 28.Iha, who helped bring the lost man back home, told journalists authorities had taken him to the Tanzanian embassy after hearing him speak Kiswahili."While they were there, they were advised to bring him to us at the Kenyan embassy. I communicated with him fluently in Giriama," he said."Kithi could not remember exactly where he came from but mentioned three names of places, one of which was Jilore.""Since he spoke the truth, it made it easier for us to trace his home," Iha said, adding that he was given responsibility of tracing the man's family.Iha told the press he took photos of Kithi outside the Kenyan embassy in Burundi, assigned brief captions and posted them on Facebook."The idea received a good response as each day there were many shares from people who saw the post," he said."It took me three months to get his family on Facebook. Some of the people commented and shared until one of his uncles saw it and contacted the embassy."All this time, Kithi was in safe custody at a camp where authorities provided him with Sh1,500 weekly for food and upkeep as the search went on.His uncle Jeremiah Ngari said he saw the post which had been shared in July but could not get contacts.He found the Facebook page of the Burundian embassy and wrote them a message which was replied after two weeks."The authorities wanted to get more information which I provided and confirmed that he was my long lost nephew," he said.Malindi MP Willy Mtengo financed and coordinated Kithi's travel from Burundi . He thanked authorities at the embassies for their assistance."We shall organise for him to get an identity card. The family should treat him well as he needs to adjust after staying away from the country for long," the MP said.Kithi left Burundi by bus on Friday accompanied by Iha. He was first welcomed by Mtengo in his office before being driven in a convoy of five vehicles to his home.The man s elder sister Elizabeth Zawadi cried when she told visitors that they had lost hope of ever seeing their only remaining brother.Kithi's was informed that his father and brother died early this year leaving behind his mother and three sisters.Family members slaughtered a goat for him amid preparations for a big party.
