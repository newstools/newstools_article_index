Thirty-two fishermen marooned by the Lake Victoria hyacinth in Homa Bay county for three days are finally free. The weed was blown away during a storm on Sunday night. The fishermen from Chwowe Beach in Rachuonyo North subcounty had been stranded since Friday night. County Beach Management Unit chairman Edward Oremo said the fishermen, who were in eight boats, went to fish near Rabuor Island in Kisumu county. He said the weed surrounded the boats when the fishermen were about three kilometres from the mainland.Chwowe Beach Management Unit chairman Peter Sikuku said, We could see our fellow fishermen but no vessel could navigate to where they were. Homa Bay police commander John Omusanga said, It s fortunate they were saved by strong winds because we had considered calling the National Disaster Operations Centre in Nairobi to send us helicopters to rescue them. Survivor Daniel Mboya said they were bitten by mosquitoes and were hungry. He called for eradication of the weed. This weed is an economic drawback among members of the fishing community, Mboya said
