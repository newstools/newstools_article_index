West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin has faulted Education CS Fred Matiang i over his recent remarks that county chiefs misuse public funds on foreign trips.He wants the CS to apologise to governors for offending them . Kachapin said the CS was wrong to say governors have gone for wasteful trips outside the country. He said the CS went overboard. What mandate does he have to tell governors not to go for trips? I have not gone for any trip this year. I have been busy trying uplift education standards through giving out bursaries and putting up infrastructure, Kachapin said. He said the CS should stick to his work.Matiang i had said governors spend a lot of money on overseas trips at the expense of the Early Childhoold Development Education.The CS urged the county chiefs to stop their luxurious trips and instead use the money to support education. What he said was in bad faith. He should have mentioned the names of those people he thinks have been travelling abroad , Kachapin said.The county boss urged the CS to stop making statements that are untrue . We have witnessed many bad things, including strikes, during Matiang i s tenure, Kachapin said.He said the education sector is very sensitive and consultations from other stakeholders is key. He should involve other stakeholders or he will fail terribly. He should know that he needs our support, Kachapin said.
