The Safaricom Foundation has partnered with NGO Operation Ear Drop Kenya to pay for the surgeries of 240 people across the country.In a statement yesterday, Safaricom Foundation trustee Stephen Chege (pictured) said it has set aside Sh3.3 million for screening, surgeries and after-care for ENT patients. We have already been to Kisii, where 14 surgeries were undertaken last month. The next surgical camp will be in Kisumu in December. This shows our commitment to transforming the lives of Kenyans by improving their health, he said.Fifty-four Nanyuki residents will undergo surgery. The town was selected as a beneficiary for lack of a referral hospital.Operation Ear Drop Kenya medical committee chief Isaac Macharia said, We continue to seek more partnerships in every outreach to supplement the Safaricom Foundation grant. The approximate cost of an outreach is Sh600,000.
