An MP has expressed dissatisfaction with the nomination of Justice Philomena Mwilu as the next Deputy Chief Justice.Kandara lawmaker Alice Wahome said the Judicial Service Commission failed by nominating Mwilu to succeed Justice Kalpana Rawal, saying there were more qualified candidates.She spoke at Kagira Secondary School while handing over a Sh500,000 CDF cheque for construction of a modern kitchen.Wahome said Mwilu should not have been nominated because she has been biased, disrespectful and used bad language while serving as a judge at the Court of Appeal, especially in cases involving women. I have attended her cases severally and she used impolite language and did not respect subordinate staff. In my opinion, she is not fit for the job. From the interviews conducted by the JSC, one can tell there were candidates smarter than her, she said.Wahome, a lawyer, said Mwilu could not have beaten the other candidates. Though we will know why she was selected, I wouldn t have nominated her if I were on the interviewing panel, Wahome said.She said she will champion other MPs to reject Mwilu s nomination because there are better judges who can hold the position and perform well . I will be the first to vote no because I have seen how she handles women. She cannot be trusted to be fair, especially for women as the constitution requires, Wahome said.She said she has no personal conflict with Mwilu, who has been described as competent and a team player by her colleagues.
