Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed has been nominated chairperson of the African Union Commission by the Kenyan government.President Uhuru Kenyatta revealed this on Monday during the Youth Summit held at State House Nairobi."I am happy that two ladies called Amina are doing well and one of them is CS Amina Mohammed who we have nominated to be the AU Chairperson," he said while addressing radio journalist Amina Abdi who moderated the summit.The nomination process for the next Chairperson started in July this year but failed after the candidates then couldn't get two-thirds of the votes.The current Chair, South Africa s Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has been at the helm since 2012.Reliable sources say the Jubilee administration was urging Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to go for the job, an offer he may have declined, leading to the proposal of Amina.The Foreign Affairs CS will face it out with former Ugandan vice president Specioza Kazibwe, the Equatorial Guinea Foreign Minister Agapito Mokuy and his counterpart from Botswana, Pelonomi Moitoi.Amina has served in the public service for 29 years and was once Kenya s Ambassador/Permanent Representative at the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Kenya to the UN in Geneva.Read: Kenya lobbies for CS Amina to be UN Secretary GeneralThe UN Secretary General then appointed her the United Nations Assistant Secretary General and Deputy Executive Director of UNEP in Nairobi.The CS has led Kenya in organising global conferences starting with the Global Entrepreneurship Summit addressed by US President Barack Obama, the World Trade Organisation 14th ministerial conference and recently the 14th United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) conference, all in Nairobi.
