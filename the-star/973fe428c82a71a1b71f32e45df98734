Baringo residents want a forensic audit carried out to ascertain the amount the county government spent to prepare the 2016-17 budget.Led by civil society chairman Silas Kibiwott they wondered where the budget team got the money they spent for seven days in Uganda, two weeks in a Naivasha hotel and 10 days in Nakuru during the budget-making process.The budget was passed last Tuesday.Kibiwot said the team is currently out on "a special honey moon" trip to Tanzania. I wonder how the about 30-member group got the money from to meet both the cost of their travel tickets, daily accommodation and entertainment allowances during their trips if they have not exorbitantly fleeced the county treasury, He said.
