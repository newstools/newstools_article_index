There was drama at Kimana Mixed Secondary School when a local MCA attempted to commission a new laboratory built by the Kajiado county government.Witnesses said James Kuya, Kimana MCA, had made a plaque, complete with his name and title, in preparation to commission the project when Governor David Nkedianye arrived in a convoy.In most cases, commissioning of such projects is always a preserve of the governor; and if away, he can assign his executives to do the job.Kuya, according to those present at the event, wanted to open the laboratory without involving the county government.When Nkedianye settled on his seat and after sharing the rumours making rounds in the event, he warned the MCA that he is the one obliged by the law of Kenya to do that."You should not be involved in our politics with your brother Daniel Nina. How do you come and open classes without informing me yet am the governor of this county. Is that right? Do not lie to wananchi that you control the project. Your job is just to oversee the projects," the angry governor said.Nina is Nkedianye s opponent in the 2017 gubernatorial race in Kajiado."Kimana is just one out of the 25 wards in Kajiado county. How do I even call you and you tell me that you are in a meeting," he asked the MCA.He said: "If President Uhuru Kenyatta arrives in Kajiado county and calls me over the phone, I will leave whatever I am doing and attend to the head of state,""Don't mislead these people or make your people miss on development because of you," cautioned Nkedianye.Area MP Katoo ole Metito said the county government is doing a good job by extending a helping hand to the schools in the region.The governor, later, told the MCA to open the laboratory due to the respect he accords to the wananchi present.But Nkedianye quickly reminded those present that no MCA is allowed to official open any project without the knowledge of the county government.Read: Don't blindly fight projects of rivals, politicians told
