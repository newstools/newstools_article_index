Former IG David Kimaiyo has said he will not answer those dragging his name in the mud on social media.Kimaiyo has publicly declared his interest to run for Elegeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen's seat in 2017.A group of youth supporting Murkomen criticised him saying he will not defeat an eloquent and influential Murkomen.They said he was under 'sieke', for 'siege', which arose from his mispronunciation of the word during the 2013 Westgate mall terrorist attack.Murkomen also said in a Facebook post last week: "Elgeyo Marakwet will not be under sieke. Not under my watch.""If he was competent, then security in the country would not have improved after his exit as IG," he added.But Kimaiyo said he was used to being castigated on the platform and even reminisced about the days Kenyans made fun of him while he was in the police service."An attack on social media is like a cockroach that has fallen into a cup of milk. You just remove the cockroach and continue drinking your milk. It is harmless," he said.He added that a senior citizen could not stoop so low as to respond to social media insults.The ex-police chief said it was wrong for some people to claim on Facebook that he was opposing President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto."I work closely with the President and the DP. My announcement does not mean I am opposing them," he said."When the seat falls vacant next year, I will submit my application to the people of this county and they will determine whether I am suitable or not."Speaking in Tot, Marakwet East, on Friday, Kimaiyo asked youths to use social media to discuss issues of development instead of attacking leaders.Read: Kimaiyo and Murkomen cross swordsAlso read: Murkomen to teach Kimaiyo political lesson
