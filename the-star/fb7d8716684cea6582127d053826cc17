Every constituency will get a new technical training institution, as the national government has set aside Sh40 billion to establish them, Kiambu woman representative Ann Nyokabi said yesterday. In Kiambu county we have started with Lari, Gatundu and Kikuyu constituencies, which will be centres of excellence where the youth will also be trained on oil drilling. This will help young people become self reliant, she said.Nyokabi spoke at Kilimambogo Technical Training Institute during its graduation ceremony.She said the initiative is aimed at equipping more than 11 million youth with skills to enable them get jobs and be job creators. Kenya has a deficit of plumbers, masons, carpenters and general technicians and such experts are in demand in the real estate sector, Nyokabi said. At The Thika Technical Training Institute we have educated more than 400 youth on courses such as electrical installation, painting, plumbing, tailoring, bakery, catering, dress-making, wiring, masonry and welding, and all of them are now earning from either being self-employed or working for other institutions, she added. Nyokabi said her office sponsors high school leavers for technical training. To enable them acquire these skills we allocated 10 per cent of our budget, which translates to Sh400,000 per constituency, to train youth in each of the constituencies in Kiambu county," she said. Nyokabi said she has written a proposal to the national government to give tools and equipment to the trained youths so they can set up their own businesses. In partnership with the technical institutions, we have come up with a one-month course for the youth to get training, while the institutions are closed so that they can get the certificates. We have managed to train 400 youths, most of whom were abusing drugs and living a reckless life and are now contributing to the economy, she said.
