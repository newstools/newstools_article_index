President Uhuru Kenyatta has postponed his Trans Nzoia tour until the county completes preparing all 156,000 title he will issue in a grand ceremony.Uhuru was to visit this month and issue the deeds, a flagship project of Governor Patrick Khaemba. We had asked the President not to miss Trans Nzoia during his Western Kenya tour, but he wants all farms to have titles. He will issue them once all are processed, the governor said on Wednesday in Kitale.About 88,000 titles are ready and 62,000 remain to be processed. They are expected to be ready by the end of the year. Khaemba said more farms than expected need to be surveyed. He said the county is partnering with the national government to prepare at least 150,000 under the national titling programme.The county is facilitating the process by paying outstanding land rates for landowners to the Lands ministry. In the last financial year, Trans Nzoia allocated Sh70 million to the programme. In May, the state increased surveyors from 23 to 63 to speed up the work, which began early this year.The processing is done under the national titling programme. After we started the surveying programme, we realised there were more farms than we expected, Khaemba said. We thought only 70 farms lacked title deeds but discovered there are 256. Issuance of title deeds is one of Khaemba s flagship projects. We had asked the President not to fail to visit Trans Nzoia during his Western Kenya tour, but he wants all farms to have the titles. He ll issue them once all are processed, the governor said.Khaemba said the Kenya Railways Corporation has agreed to give the county 10 acres to expand Kitale town to ease congestion. It has 8,000 boda boda riders, he said. Khaemba said construction of the Sh200 million Kitale Bus Park will be completed soon.
