Three Senators on Friday backed their colleague Anyang' Nyong o's bid for Kisumu governor during the 2017 general election.The legislators James Orengo (Siaya), Moses Kajwang' (Homa Bay) and Hassan Omar (Mombasa) said Nyong o is best placed to be Kisumu CEO.Omar said Nyong o has the spirit of devolution in him "unlike present governors who have mastered the art of plundering public resources".He said most governors are seeking re-election for office but they have done nothing to the electorate four years since they assumed office."Some of them have left a trail of looting public funds instead of investing the money on intended projects to better the lives of ordinary citizens,"Omar said when they were hosted by senator Nyong'o at his Seme home on Friday.He said the Kisumu senator is a man of integrity who should be entrusted with leadership, who can initiate massive developments in the county.Kajwang' drummed up support for Nyong o saying he has massive knowledge on devolution, hence the best candidate to bring the desired change in Kisumu.He said the senator s track record both at national and county level is visible urging Kisumu residents to support his bid in the next poll.Read: Ranguma denies claims he has formed a partyFor his part, Orengo said the former Kisumu Rural MP has a wealth of experience and understands what devolution is.He added that he has had a long close relationship with Nyong o and must support him to ensure residents of Kisumu get a development oriented governor.MPs Fred Outa (Nyando), James Nyikal (Seme) and Kisumu woman representative Rose Nyamunga - who were present at the event in Seme sub-county - backed Nyong o for the seat.Nyamunga, who is facing competition from ODM party deputy organizing Secretary Rosa Buyu, declared that the only seats that will be up for grabs in 2017 are that of the governor and senator.Kisumu deputy governor Ruth Odinga, Nyong o, David Wayiera - a banker; businessman Hezron McObewa and UN WFP employee Asaka Nyagara are among those bidding to unseat governor Jack Ranguma.
