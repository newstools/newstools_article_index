Garbage collectors in the city have petitioned Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero to fire the Environment executive Peter Kimori over failure to address their grievances.Speaking at a Nairobi Hotel, the garbage collectors said that since being sworn into office, the new environment chief has done little to address the problem of garbage in the City."We are uncomfortable working with the environment chief because he has usurped the powers of the Environment Chief officer Christine Ogut. He is now the AIE holder and everything has to stop with him. We have requested for several meetings with him but he has been snubbing us," said Martin Karanja from Everywhere bins.The garbage collectors warned that they will down their tools if Kidero does not sack the CEC whom they said is engaged in too much politics at the expense of serving City residents."He campaigned in Bomachoge as an MP in the last elections and lost.He is still engaging in politics by concentrating on his campaigns at the expense of service delivery. He must resign," said Joseph Ondari from Waste Management Association of Kenya.Efforts to get Kimori for a comment were futile as all his three numbers went answered.The County Environment Chief Officer Christine Ogut could also not be reached for comment as her phone went answered.
