Residents of Marama North ward in Butere yesterday protested against the poor state of the Bumamau-Shisa road. They placed banana stems on the road and charged motorists a maintenance fee of Sh20 to Sh100 to use it.They asked area MCA Sayyid Omsiritsa to have the road fixed. I have information that some of my opponents paid idle youth to plant bananas on the road, then take credit when the contractor who is already on site, repairs it. That is cheap politics of endangering our youth because the youth have no mandate to charge motorists as some are doing in the guise of maintaining the road, Omsiritsa said. The road falls under the county quota and not under my jurisdiction as much as it is in my ward. It has already been assigned to a contractor who is on site. I wonder what the youths want.
