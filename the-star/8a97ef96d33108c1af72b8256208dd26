Nema has ordered the closure of the Makutano slaughterhouse in, terming it unfit for operation. Officer Christopher Muchiri on Saturday said the meat waste from the premises are discharged to open areas and finds its way to the nearby Kotoruk River.He added that there is bad smell which is as a result of the decomposition process of accumulated organic waste deposited in open , saying this has caused inconveniences to the nearby resident and business community. The smell is very bad and has affected the people nearby. Even the facility has never been licensed by NEMA and its custodians have never bothered to apply for it as required by law. It has not undertaken any initial or annual environment audit , stated the director.
