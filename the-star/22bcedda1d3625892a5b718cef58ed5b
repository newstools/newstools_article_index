Three women involved in the failed Mombasa Central police station terror attack have been linked to a terror cell in the Daadad refugee camp, Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed has said. There is sufficient evidence to show they had some links, she said, without elaborating. Abdulahi Farah, said to be the leader of the group, was shot dead alongside Fatuma Omar and another female terror suspect, when they allegedly attacked two police officers and detonated a device on September 11.Yesterday, Amina said such cases form part of the reasons the government has to close the camp by November. We are doing this because of our own security. Let s close the camps and see what happens. We ll then see if the evidence we have presented was concrete or not, she said in New York. She is a attending the UN General Assembly. Amina said the government targets to repatriate more than 150,000 refugees.Read:[VIDEO] Cops accused of killing three 'innocent' girls at Mombasa Central police station
