Kenya should plan ahead of an imminent rise in global crude oil prices which will reflect on the local market prices next year, the Petroleum Institute of East Africa has cautioned.PIEA projects a rise in crude oil prices in the next quarter and early 2017 where a barrel is likely to cost between $60 (Sh6,074 ) and $65 (Sh6,580 ), from the current average of $43.44 (Sh4,397) a 38 per cent rise.The institute's projection echoes that of the Economist Intelligence Unit which also forecasts higher oil prices next year, citing higher consumption likely to exceed production.Pump prices are projected to go above Sh100 per litre in the local market by January, according to PIEA.This means companies which opt for fuel hedging could capitalise on the current prices as a way of maintaining moderate fuel expenditure when prices go up. If we are planning as a nation or company, think about the cost of oil going up in 2017 compared to 2016, PIEA chairman Powell Maimba said on Wednesday.The price rise could, however, be felt as early as next month after the Energy Regulatory Commission hinted at a price hike pointing out that a barrel of Murban crude oil rose 2.58 per cent in August to $45.75 (Sh4,631). There is usually a time lag of 30 to 40 days from the time an oil marketer makes an order to the time the petroleum products are delivered at the Port of Mombasa.Petrol costs Sh91.39 a litre in Nairobi, Sh87.99 in Mombasa and Sh93.42 in Kisumu.A litre of diesel costs Sh82.46 in Nairobi, Sh79.08 (Mombasa) and Sh84.65 (Kisumu). Oil crisis has been running back and forth but if you are planning for next year budget, crude oil and finished products are showing growth, Maimba said.
