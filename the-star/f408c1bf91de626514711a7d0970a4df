Kenya filmmakers have said lack of data is the main problem hindering industry growth.Representative Wambui Chege yesterday said the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics has no data on film production.She said this has made it difficult for investors to have trust in the industry. We need the government to start taking the film industry seriously, so that investors can have a reference when invited to join in, Wambui said at the Africa Film Finance Summit. She said the film industry in Nigeria contributes up to eight per cent of total economic growth. Wambui said if the Kenya film industry moves from grants-funding to commercial finance, then it would become powerful.She also said limited finance, low production standards, copyright, poor marketing and distribution, slow down the growth of the industry.A study commissioned by the KFC in 2015 indicates that the Kenyan film industry has the potential to rake in up to Sh120 billion annually and generate millions of new jobs .Currently, the industry earns Sh7 billion annually and produces hundreds of films every year.
