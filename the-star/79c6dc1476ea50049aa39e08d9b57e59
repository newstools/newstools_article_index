The Mombasa Somali community has denied having taken a political stand as reported by some media houses.Chairman Mohamed Abdi on Sunday said they are yet to decide whom to support or front for political seats. He said some people are making personal statements but pretend to be talking on behalf of the community. Abdi, Hajir Maow and Abdinur Ali said Changamwe MP aspirant Abdi Daib has been making inflammatory political statements, contrary to their principles. The three spoke at a Mombasa hotel. They were reacting to an announcement on a local radio station that invited the community to an October 2 Jubilee meeting to be chaired by MP Aden Duale.
