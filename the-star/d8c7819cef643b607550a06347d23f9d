A woman suspected to have conspired with her American lover to kill her husband at a Watamu resort last year was charged with murder on Thursday.Amina Yakub Shiraz appeared before Malindi resident judge Said Chitembwe where she was charged with the murder of Jimmy Jagatram Baburam on July 26, 2015. The accused was said to have conspired with her American lover Jacob Schmalzle to drown Baburam, in a swimming pool at Medina Palms Resort.Already, detectives have launched manhunt against the American who fled when police obtained fresh evidence linking him with the murder.The suspects, the court heard, allegedly had a love affair and were on holiday when the incident happened.Senior assistant DPP Vincent Monda, while seeking for the suspect to be denied bond, told the court that Shiraz threatened two witnesses.Citing a letter by the Malindi DCIO, Monda asked the court to protect the two key witnesses, adding that the same showed the magnitude of the matter."Shiraz threatened former Medina Palms Resort manager Ashraf Kassim and security guard Emanuel Wafula who witnessed the murder incident," Monda said. "She is facing a capital offence in Kenya and might abscond court since if found guilty, the consequence is death," the prosecutor said. Maru Nishit, the lawyer representing the deceased, also told the court not to grant her bond arguing that the accused if released on bail might escape to the US.He dismissed claims by defense that accused will cooperate with police the way she did during the inquest of Baburam s death."Her accomplice Schmalzle also used to attend court but escaped, her children have have a residence in the UAE. Given opportunity, she might abscond court," he said.The family lawyer said the suspect was arrested at Moi International airport, Mombasa while evading arrest.Shiraz, who was represented by two lawyers, said it was her constitutional right to be released on bond.Gicheru Kimani, one of the lawyers, argued that the accused is a Kenyan citizen, with three children and a businesswoman dealing with pets. "She needs bail to take care of her businesses and family; and can deposit her passport and have a surety," Kimani said.The defense lawyer said the prosecution had not shown any evidence to prove that the accused threatened the witnesses as alleged by police.The judge ordered the accused to be remanded at Malindi GK Prison pending the ruling set to be delivered on October 26.Shiraz was arrested on Sunday, October 9 at 8pm by detectives at Moi international airport.Read: DPP to advise on inquest into death of trader at resort
