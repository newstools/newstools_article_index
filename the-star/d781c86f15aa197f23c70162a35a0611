The IEBC s timelines for the 2017 elections are not being treated with the seriousness they deserve by the political elite. It is becoming clearer by the day that Parliament was in too much of a hurry to pass the IEBC reforms recommended by the bipartisan Select Committee.Members of the legislature always think they know best, but nine times out of 10 they mess up, especially on a bipartisan basis.The focus should be on what to do next, as soon as next week, to rectify the situation and avert a crisis. The IEBC timelines may no longer be feasible and legislators need to be flexible and swift in amending the laws appropriately.The registration of voters, the elaborate procurement laws and the acquisition and integration of BVRs, Evids and results transmission technology are activities and systems that ought to have been handled months ago.This last-minute culture in preparations for elections constitutes a threat to stability.The prospect of bungling yet another general election is unacceptable.
