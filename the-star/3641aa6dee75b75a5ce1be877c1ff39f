Microsoft, the giant computer software maker, has launched a flexible, enterprise grade cloud computing platform in its ongoing engagement with nonprofit and nongovernmental organisations. The Microsoft Azure, which is part of Public Cloud for Good global initiative, will cost $1 billion (Sh101 billion) in cloud computing resources. It targets 70,000 nonprofit entities and NGOs worldwide. The initiative to enroll 10,000 NGOs in sub-Saharan Africa will take place in the next three years. (This) confirms that Microsoft is on a mission to empower every person and organisation on the planet to achieve more by investing in technology, employees and partnerships, to drive greater inclusion and empowerment of people who do not have access to technology and the opportunities it enables, Microsoft Kenya country manager Kunle Awosika said.
