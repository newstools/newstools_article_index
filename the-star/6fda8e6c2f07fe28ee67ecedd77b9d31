Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has said he has no personal differences with Murang a Governor Mwangi Wairia.The MP, the governor s biggest rival, said he only has a problem with Wairia s ideology.Kamau spoke on Sunday at Sacred Heart of Jesus Greystone Catholic in Gatanga. He criticised the governor s use of public resources, which he said are not channelled to important projects. I campaigned for Wairia in 2013 and I actually voted for him. Our differences are caused by wastage of public resources, Kamau said.The MP said his criticism is issue-based, not personal. He said he cannot sit back and watch money get wasted on sweet potato vines and cow crushes constructed all over the county. None has been used since 2013. I m also against the Kenneth Matiba Eye and Dental Hospital in Kennol town. A lot of money was and will be squandered, Jamleck said. It would have been wiser to construct a new hospital instead of renting a flat. The MP, who will try to unseat Wairia, said the county has not implemented relevant projects.He called for peaceful campaigns and urged aspirants to avoid insulting their rivals during rallies.
