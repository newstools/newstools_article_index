Murang a Governor Mwangi Wairia has suspended two Transport officials indefinitely over "laxity".Transport executive Eng Amos Njoroge and chief officer Engineer Simon Thuku were suspended on Tuesday evening over delayed implementation of county government projects.The two were suspended over the Sh1 billion feeder roads rehabilitation programme the governor launched two months ago.It is said the two officers delayed murraming of the feeder roads that have been graded without tangible reasons.The county government has gradeed more than 5,000km of roads and more than 350 are expected to be rehabilitated before the onset of the rains.Wairia said the duo cannot explain the delayed implementation of the phase two of the roads rehabilitation project, which was to start three weeks ago.The governor said only roads in 15 of the 35 wards have been murramed, yet money to upgrade all feeder roads has been allocated in the budget. These officers are being paid huge salaries to work for the people, but they are the ones delaying development projects, Wairia said.The governor said lax county employees and those who fail to deliver as expected will be sacked and replaced with hardworking people. We have only one year remaining to concentrate on service delivery before the next general election. We cannot afford to waste this time, Wairia said.The governor is reported to have put members of his cabinet on notice earlier over non-performance. He told those not committed to delivering their duties effectively to resign.He had earlier raised concerns over tardiness by some employees, saying it is "a way of stealing from the public". I am not willing to work with people who drag my government behind by failing to provide services to residents appropriately, the governor said.
