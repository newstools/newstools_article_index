Pope Francis donned surgical scrubs and a mask to cradle premature babies in a surprise visit to a Rome hospital.Francis seemed enchanted by the 12 tiny babies squirming, sleeping and crying in the neonatology unit of San Giovanni hospital, where he left a papal medal in each crib.The Argentine pontiff held the newborns in his arms and later greeted new parents at the maternity ward and nursery upstairs.He cradled newborn Emiliano, asking 'Is he eating well?' and inquired about other babies. Five of the babies, including a pair of twins, were in intensive care and were intubated. Pictures showed the Pontiff shaking hands with some of the parents, as staff gathered round and snapped photos on their phones.Each month of his Holy Year of Mercy, Francis spends one Friday afternoon outside the Vatican performing an act of mercy. The Vatican said he wanted to send a message about respecting life at all stages, from its start to natural death. 'The Pope, who was greeted with astonishment by the staff, put on a face mask and underwent all the necessary hygiene precautions for the aseptic environment,' the statement said. The Pontiff later went across the city to visit the 'Villa Speranza' hospice which cares for 30 terminally ill patients.The two visits continue his monthly series of unannounced trips.'Days after canonising Mother Teresa a 'who gave great service in favour of life,' the Argentinian pontiff wanted to visit 'two very symbolic buildings,' the Vatican statement said.
