Wajir town and Turkish municipality Haliliye will establish relations to boost trade, county administrator Mohamed Noor has said. The Turkish government has initiated procedures to formalise relations, Noor said in Wajir town on Thursday. For any city in Turkey to sign sister city protocol with a foreign city, there are some internal procedures to be followed, which are ongoing, he said.Once the procedures are completed, the Foreign Affairs ministry and other relevant authorities will be notified, Noor said.A letter by the Turkish ambassador to Kenya addressed to Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi says the development will make Wajir county the first to enter into such relations with a Turkish city.Turkey previously funded development projects like sanitation, health and agriculture in Garissa, Mandera and Wajir.The Turkish city, which is found in Sanlurfa province, is renowned for animal husbandry, agriculture, tourism and energy generation. The idea of twin towns and sister cities was conceived after World War II to rebuild diplomatic relations and bring together citizens through cultural and educational exchanges. Sister city partnerships are increasingly used to forge strategic trade and economic ties. Noor said these ties build friendships and networks that generate business development, economic growth, tourism and education.In March, the Wajir government met donors in Nairobi to seek funding for key projects to fast-track development.Abdullahi led county leaders in asking for funds for water and health.
