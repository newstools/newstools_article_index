Services at the Kilifi-Mariakani water and sewerage company were disrupted yesterday during a workers strike.The more than 100 workers blocked the entrance to the offices and set tyres on fire. They were protesting against what they termed poor management.Kilifi Food and Allied Workers Union secretary Ben Mzungu accused managers of misusing funds and harassing junior staff. Today we want to forward our grievances. We have written to the management and had several meetings but no solution has been reached, Mzungu said. Water has been disconnected in several places and bills are paid they are not reconnected. The management is also squandering money in unjustified trips. The workers called for an immediate overhaul of the board of management. Mzungu criticised mistreatment and unfair dismissal of junior staff. Juniour staff are not paid allowances accordingly and when they complain they are dismissed. The senior managers make mistakes but nothing happens to them, he said.Water executive Kiringi Mwachitu urged the workers to resume duties as a solution is sought. I know you are aggrieved and want to talk. Let me meet with your officials and listen to your grievances before meeting the management, Mwachitu said.Jonathan Kombe accused the management of favouritism and tribalism in handling of matters, including salaries. The salaries are not harmonised. We want the whole team, including the Human Resource management and the commercial chief to be sacked. There should be fair treatment to all workers, irrespective of their position, he said. By the time of going to press, the company management had not reported to work and were not available for comment.
