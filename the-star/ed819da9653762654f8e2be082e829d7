Cord leader Raila Odinga yesterday told President Uhuru Kenyatta to implement the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission report.Raila addressed a rally in Kilgoris town at the start of his two-day tour of Narok county.He said the Maasai community has suffered historical injustices dating back more than 100 years. This will be addressed once the report is implemented, Raila said.The former Prime Minister said the report was handed to Uhuru by chairman Bethuel Kiplagat in May 2013. It was to be tabled and discussed in Parliament, then implemented within six months. Nothing has been done. The report has not been officially released. It is now more than three years since Kiplagat handed the report and there are no signs it will be implemented, Raila said. He added that the report touches on the top Jubilee leadership and their supporters. Only Cord leaders can implement it once we are elected in 2017, Raila said.The Cord leader said Jubilee intends to subdivide the Mau Forest land among its supporters. He said he received reports that some title deeds are being prepared for powerful people to put up tea plantations in the forest. This will destroy the crucial water tower, Raila said. You know the efforts I made to save the Mau Forest when I was Prime Minister, which was turned against me as a campaign tool, he said. It has now been proven that some people are salivating over the land and they have already made efforts to take it over. The opposition leader accused senior government officials of siphoning revenue from the Maasai Mara Game Reserve, which could have been used to improve the lives of Narok residents.ODM national chairman John Mbadi, national treasurer Timothy Bosire, Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang were present.
