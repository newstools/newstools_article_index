Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja has accused the Nairobi government of impeding the growth of city businesses.Sakaja, who will vie against incumbent Governor Evans Kidero in 2017, said the county should encourage and facilitate business people, not harass and stifle them.He spoke during a meet-the-people tour in Soweto area, Kayole, on Saturday.The MP promised to stand by small scale traders who are facing eviction and harassment, and ensure they are not moved from their area of operation unless they are allocated an alternative space.The traders are supposed to vacate the area by Monday to create room for road expansion but the county government is yet to tell them where they will go.Read: Joho, Kidero, Ranguma threaten to sue Jubilee for economic sabotageSakaja, the traders and other Kayole residents discussed other challenges including garbage collection, a higher crime rate, grabbing of public property including road reserves and lack of opportunities, especially for youths.Residents said the grabbing was by people with connections at both the national and county government levels.They also complained that health services managed by the Nairobi government were expensive.Sakaja said that it was unacceptable that public land and facilities were being grabbed under the county's watch.He noted the role of Kidero's government is to ensure all city residents get the services they need because they have paid for them.Kidero said in JUly that Nairobi residents needs politics of development, not division and negative ethnicity.
