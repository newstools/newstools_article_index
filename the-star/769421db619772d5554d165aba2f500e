It was captured on TV cameras and seen all over Kenya in our homes: Nairobi MCAs belonging to the Cord coalition, physically attacking one of their own in broad daylight. The victim of their attacks, Viwandani MCA Sam Nyangwara of ODM, had to leave the debating chamber via back door, to escape the attention of his tormentors.This is the kind of thing which Kenyans have long deplored, and which seemed to be likely to end, now that the position of MCA seemed to be attracting a better kind of candidate than the old semi-literate councillors. As we go into the peak of the 2017 election cycle, the government must come out clearly to ensure that such acts of gratuitous violence are punished to the fullest extent of the law.There will always be bitter political differences between us. But violence should have no part in our politics, and our well-entrenched cult of impunity must come to an end, if our democracy is to endure.
