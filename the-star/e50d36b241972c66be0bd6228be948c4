Former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana has urged residents to reject Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho as Coast kingpin.He said Cord leaders seeking political positions have no agenda for the people. Mungatana said Joho does not command the region because he only represents Mombasa.He said historically, the Coast kingpin comes from Kilifi county and Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung aro fits the bill. Mungatana spoke on Saturday during the burial of former Tourism minister Morris Dzoro s sister in Ribe. He asked Joho to stop bragging that he is kingpin because he does not fit the bill to be one .Coast political kingpins have been Ronald Ngala (Kadu Asili founder), Jembe Mwakalu and Karisa Maitha. The three were from Kilifi. Mungatana said the next one should come from there and from the same community.
