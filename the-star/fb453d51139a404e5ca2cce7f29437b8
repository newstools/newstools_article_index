Haniya Said Sagar, the widow of slain muslim cleric Aboud Rogo, on Friday was charged with withholding information that could have prevented the attack at the Mombasa Central Police Station on September 11.According to the charges, Sagar (pictured) had information prior to the attack but failed to disclose it to authorities. She denied the offence when she appeared before Mombasa principal magistrate Diana Mochache. The charge sheet indicated that on September 5 at around midday, in Kanamai, knowingly and having reasonable grounds to believe she knew Tasmin Yakoub, the mastermind of the attack, Sagar failed to inform the authorities. The court on Monday will allow submissions for bond by the prosecution and the defence.Mochache ordered state counsel Alexander Muteti to serve the defence with information about the case. Sagar s lawyer Mbugua Mureithi protested against the decision, saying the prosecution did not serve them with sworn affidavits, before charging his client. Three classmates who were arrested, released and re-arrested by police, were to be charged in the afternoon at the Shanzu court.Luul Ali, Nasteho Ali and Zamzam Abdullah are suspected to be accomplices of three women who attacked the police station. State counsel Erick Masila told the court to consider the current situation caused by the attack and grant the police orders to detain them.However, defence counsel Jared Magolo has opposed detention of the girls, saying prosecution did not give reasons.
