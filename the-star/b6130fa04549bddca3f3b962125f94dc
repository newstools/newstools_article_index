Vice chancellors of public universities should be vetted when being considered for appointments, Education CS Fred Matiang'i has said.Matiang'i said this would ensure appointments are more open, transparent and accountable."The Chancellors could chair a forum where a section of members of the Senate of the respective university, student leadership and alumnae interrogate shortlisted candidates for VC positions," he said on Thursday.The CS was speaking during the Second Roundtable Discussion on Policies, Regulations and Standards for University Education.He said Chancellors should develop conflict resolution mechanisms to address internal conflicts facing their respective universities instead of involving courts.He also noted that politicisation and negative ethnicity of universities was undermining the capacities of universities to establish and strengthen the infrastructure needs to provide quality education.[AUDIO] Two governors, MPs storm Moi University over new 'outsider' VC AyiroMatiang'i asked Chancellors to explore ways of providing effective leadership and management of higher education institutions.Present during the occasion were officials of the Commission for University Education.The CS's remarks came shortly after two governors and several MPs stormed Moi University in Eldoret to demand the removal of the newly appointed acting VC.They threatened to stop the university's graduation ceremony unless their preferred vice chancellor was appointed.Education CS Fred Matiang'i appointed Laban Ayiro in the position, to replace outgoing vice chancellor Richard Mibey,But the leaders said they wanted professor Isaac Kosgey appointed as he "topped recruitment interviews".
