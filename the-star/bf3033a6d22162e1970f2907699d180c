Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula has castigated NCIC chairman Francis Kaparo for failing to report ethnic imbalance in national government departments.The Cord co-principal issued a statement on Tuesday following a survey by the commission, that showed the JSC is the only one of 15 commissions that has hired more than a third of its workforce from the same ethnic community.More on this: JSC falls short of NCIC ethnic balance in recruitment, 39% Kikuyus hiredAlso read: JSC is a hotbed of ethnicity, says NCIC chairperson KaparoWetang'ula said it was worrying that the cohesion team has treated "tribalism executed directly by President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto with kid gloves".Noting the NCIC has failed to address tribalism within the executive arm of the national government, he asked Kaparo to table the list of senior state officials."Let him be brave enough and table the ethnic composition and balance in the national government," he said.The Bungoma Senator said the National Cohesion and Integration Commission should report on the hiring of cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries; parastatal chairpersons and chief executives.Wetang'ula also wants the same breakdown done for ambassadorial postings and those of senior government officials.He further wants the commission to give details of the quality of jobs held by persons from different ethnic backgrounds."The breakdown must not be about "useless directors" but chairmen and managing directors of these government institutions," he said.The party leader said one tribe has been favoured and dominates top government jobs "at the expense of other 40 communities who are hired on casual or lower positions such as watchmen and cooks"."The quality of ministries and parastatal is also an issue. One managing director has a higher premium than 100 cleaners or watchmen," he said.Wetangula said appointments by Uhuru and Ruto do not reflect the image of the 42 Kenyan tribes.He said such imbalances were to blame for the instability that Kenya has experienced for decades."In your compilation do not just roll out figures. They must also be relative to the percentage share of the population by any particular community," the legislator said.He added that Kaparo will only be believed if he can address tribal appointments as it is factored into the top echelons of government."That some counties hired up to 97 per cent of staff from dominant tribes is as telling of our national morals and values as it is frightening," he said."Such a scenario violates Section 65 of the County Government Act (2012) which proposes that 70 per cent of jobs be given to locals and 30 per cent be reserved for experts from outside the areas."But the Bungoma Senator hailed the commission for highlighting how counties and other small government organisations have violated the law on ethnic balance in state jobs.Read: Kenya will commit suicide if it creates ethnic statesAlso read: Ethnicity and the Kenyan system of governance
