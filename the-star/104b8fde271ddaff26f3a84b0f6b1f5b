Funyula MP Paul Otuoma has downplayed the Luhya community unity bid fronted by a section of leaders from western.He said politicians pushing the unity call have personal interests to fulfill, adding that issues in ODM raised by western leaders have been resolved.Otuoma said the best option for the Luhya community is to form government and not being part of that which will be elected in 2017."The big question we should ask ourselves is, how do we make western politically relevant at the national level?," he said.The legislator also dismissed Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula and his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka's agitation for ODM leader Raila Odinga to back their bids."Such talks have no basis. No one should wait for the seat to be given on a silver platter through boardroom agreements," he added."The best way out of this quagmire is to negotiate on pre or post-election agreements. The unresolved issue of the 2013 agreement is confusing the coalition (Cord) members," he said.Otuoma is among MPs, who more than two months ago, resigned from their respective positions in ODM, citing frustration.After he resigned as ODM vice chairman, he joined Budalang'i MP Ababu Namwamba and his Sirisia counterpart John Waluke.They formed what came to be known as the 'Third Force' and 'Mulembe Conscious' movements, which they claimed aimed at uniting voters from the region.Ababu had resigned as ODM secretary general while Waluke relinquished his membership from the party and joined the newly launched Jubilee Party.Read: Waluke, Otuoma quit third force Read: I will not leave ODM, Funyula MP Paul Otuoma declares after skipping Ababu event Before his return to ODM, Otuoma, Ababu and Waluke campaigned in Coast, Rift Valley and western where they promoted the 'Third Force' movement.Ababu recently relaunched the Labour Party of Kenya through which he will defend his seat in the 2017 polls.During the relaunch, former Funyula MP Julia Ojiambo was elected chairperson while Ababu took up the Party leader position.Other who clinched top seats included journalist David Makali (Secretary General) and Esther Kondo (Deputy Party leader.
