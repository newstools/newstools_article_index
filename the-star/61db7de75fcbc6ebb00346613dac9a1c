The small-scale Kenyan farmers and local technology entrepreneurs will benefit most from the $30 billion (Sh3 trillion) pledged by various donors for spending on agriculture in Africa over the next 10 years.The pledges were made at the African Green Revolution Forum in Nairobi.Proportionate and consistent funding of small-scale farmers can revolutionise food production throughout a continent that has long been a net food importer in less than one generation.International organisations and governments will provide the money. We can only hope that they will be much more consistent financiers than our own governments. The Economist magazine recently recalled their broken promises, reporting: In 2003 African leaders pledged to devote 10% of public spending to agriculture chiefly to roads, research and water management. By 2014 that figure was less than 3 per cent. It is high time African governments put their money where their mouths are and added to the international effort. Africa needs much more than the Sh3 trillion to develop its agriculture.
