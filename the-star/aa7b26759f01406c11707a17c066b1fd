Residents of Bilaa B village in Tongaren constituency are flocking to a home to see a three-month-old baby who is speaking. Joy Wangila is Patrick Wasike s and Salome s firstborn. Salome said the baby has shocked her. When she wants to eat something, she asks for it. If you deny her, she cries, she said. Wangila s grandmother Manea Namaemba said, My grandchild shocked me on August 2. It was on a Tuesday when she spoke for the first time. Her mother wanted to breastfeed her but she demanded porridge, she said. One day a neighbour came to see me in the field, where I was digging out potatoes for lunch. When she requested for some, the baby said do not eat anything in this homestead.
