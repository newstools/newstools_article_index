Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has told his rivals defeating him will not be a walk in the park. Come and face me for the true test, he said. Kidero said he is prepared to defend his seat, and his development track record will propel him to victory.While in Mombasa, the county boss said he is not disturbed by the entrance of former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende to the already jammed race. I am not in this race to add numbers, but as a serious contender, Marende said last month. Unlike some of the contenders, I am tested. I have served as a Speaker and an MP so I am equal to the task, he added.Water CS Eugene Wamalwa has been endorsed by a group of Central politicians, a move dismissed by some Nairobi politicians as an attempt to impose him on the people. Others in the race are Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, Dagoretti MP Dennis Waweru, businesswoman Esther Pasaris , nominated MP Johnson Sakaja and lawyer Miguna Miguna.However, Kidero does not face stiff primaries. He will run on an ODM ticket, while most of other hopefuls will seek the Jubilee Party ticket. It is not certain which party Miguna will use.
