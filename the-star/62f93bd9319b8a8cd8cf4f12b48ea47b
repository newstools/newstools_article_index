Pioneer ODM governors should not be subjected to nominations, Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has said.He said current governors deserve direct tickets for the 2017 general elections."Governors had very little time to change the lives of citizens. They have now matured enough politically to take their counties to greater heights if they win their seats next year," he said on Saturday.Read: Do not force us to vote for ODM candidates, Khalwale tells RailaRanguma said they now know wananchi's expectations were high when they took office in 2013, but governors had to be content with having only 15 per cent of the national budget."Nigeria shares the budget 50-50, while South Africa pegs [their budget] at 45 and 55 per cent for county and national governments respectively," he said."If our dreams of receiving 45 per cent of funds yields fruits, wananchi will realise massive changes," he added.Ranguma was speaking at a funeral in Busia, which was also attended by Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and Matayos MP Geoffrey Odanga.Ojaamong said they will campaign on behalf of party leader Raila Odinga in their respective counties."I will continue to respect Raila for the role he had [played] in liberating the country," he said.He said Jubilee Party had tarnished its reputation by buying opposition MPs.More on this: Jubilee 'buying' opposition leaders, says RailaOdanga said he will remain in ODM as opposed to some of his counterparts who were 'bought with peanuts' to quit their party."You voted for me in ODM and I have remained in ODM. Jubilee has failed to deliver on its pledges to wananchi, thus the need to relegate it to the periphery," he said.
