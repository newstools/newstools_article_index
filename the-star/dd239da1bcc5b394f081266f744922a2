Ford Kenya MPs Patrick Wangamati and James Lusweti have said the party will not fold to join other parties if Cord decides to merge. Wangamati said Ford Kenya enjoys a treasured and deep legacy as one of the pioneers of multi-party democracy in Kenya. The two said the countrywide ODM rallies are an indicator the party could be planning to go it alone. We know ODM is a strong and popular party among many people, but for them to send Jubilee home, they cannot fight alone. They need the coalition to enable them to secure enough votes to win, Lusweiti said. The ODM rallies are seen to focus on developing its agenda, yet it s part of Cord. The coalition deserves to be acknowledged even as they popularise the party, Wangamati said. The leaders have urged ODM to rethink its decision if it plans to pull out of Cord because the coalition has held Kenyans together and its unity will send Jubilee home.
