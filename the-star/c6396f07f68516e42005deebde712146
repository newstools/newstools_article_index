Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau today is expected to declare he will run for governor, after serving as a legislator for 10 years.The announcement is to be made at his thanksgiving ceremony. The MP has invited leaders from the national and county governments. The people made a mistake in the last general elections and now pressure has been piling up on me from residents of Murang a to lead them at the county level, Kamau said on Thursday.The MP has on several occasions had heated exchanges with Governor Mwangi Wairia as they criticise each other s development records.Last week, Kamau asked Wairia to keep off his events, unless he is invited.The MP said the governor has formed a habit of showing up and disrupting events, sometimes causing chaos.However, Wairia stood his ground and said he would attend any event in the county and asked the MP to stop being threatened by his presence at public functions.Supporters of the two politicians have been clashing in functions. Recently the governor showed up uninvited for a fundraiser for the Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation, Maragua branch. Kamau, who was the chief guest, did not show up and instead sent his wife Agnes Irungu.Wairia s team arrived later and supporters of the politicians almost disrupted the event.Police called in reinforcements from the Saba Saba station to stop the groups from fighting.A fight eventually broke out when one of Wairia s supporters tried to grab the microphone.In June, the governor attended two functions where Kamau was the chief guest.The rivalry arose when the MP said he wants to run for governor, describing Wairia s administration as a failure . In July, the MP s rural home was raided and cows were poisoned and slashed.
