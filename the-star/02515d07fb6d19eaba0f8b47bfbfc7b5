The Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders on Saturday stormed out of a meeting after a former official suggested they open an office in Nairobi.Chairman Paul M ithinkia and secretary general Phares Ruteere said former permanent secretary Francis Muthaura had no authority to speak for the elders after being "stripped of his title".They said the meeting was called to discuss Ameru professionals.M'ithinkia said, We heard him say that the supreme council will conduct elections and we are surprised. The Council of Elders wrote a letter to him and informed him his role as patron had been revoked after he politicised the CoE matter and caused division. He said the elders should be allowed to run their own affairs. The council has played a big role in the struggle for independence, making Meru what it is today. We do not have a school where you are taught about how to be a Njuri Ncheke elde. It s a big secret and our affairs should be left to us, M Ithinkia said.He said the council will not hold elections as Muthaura had earlier said. Professor cannot preside over the supreme council elections he is not the chairman and we stripped him of his role as patron, the chairman said.He said Muthaura should instead concentrate in his role as Lapset boss.Muthaura made the remarks when he was addressing Ameru professionals.Ruteere said that instead Muthaura uniting two factions of the council he picked one group allied to a political leader he did not mention.
