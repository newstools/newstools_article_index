Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma has urged Cord leaders with national standing to put aside their personal interests and help the co-principals campaign for president. He said on Monday that leaders should steer clear of grassroots politics, which divides coalition supporters. Kaluma said the opposition is weakened when MPs and senators with national standing campaign for governor. I don t say they should give up their dream of being what they want to be, but they should focus on dislodging Jubilee from power because it is the enemy in the house, he said. Kaluma spoke during a morning talk show on Mayienga FM.
