Wow! What a sight for the naked eye to behold. Before me stood a big herd of elegant-looking eland, moving slowly across the Embakasi plains as they grazed and interacted with each other. So many young calves cavorting and running after each other, and then finding refuge with their mothers. But what impressed me most was the magnificently massive large bulls. Their huge bulk stood out from the herd, and it was easy to see why the eland species is Africa s largest antelope. The bull can weigh up to 950kg. Eland get their name from the Dutch settlers who came to South Africa in the 17th Century. Eland literally means moose in Dutch. Nairobi Park has the largest antelope in Africa with the eland, and one of the smallest antelope with the shy suni. Eland are found in many places in Africa, and have become scarce in some areas, so the Nairobi Park is a place of refuge for them to breed and live in relative safety. In all the years I have been observing in the park, there have been very few eland lion kills. It appears they are very fleet-footed and intelligent. Eland have also been known to jump very high, easily clearing fences (up to almost 3m has been recorded). They are generally not harmful and have a placid nature, which has resulted in them becoming quite tame in some areas.There is so much to see in the Nairobi Park, and I always leave satisfied with a healthy dose of soul tonic . This time, mindful that eland are, indeed, elegant in their ways.
