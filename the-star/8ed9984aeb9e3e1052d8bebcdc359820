Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organisation s name should be changed to win back public confidence as its name had been tainted, Nairobi chairperson Martha Miyandazi has said.Women should also withdraw their support for the organisation as it is riddled with claims of corruption and all manner of evil , she said.Miyandazi added that women should join other groups which generate income and are well-organised. We have groups, like Diamond Women of Kenya, which have organised slum women and bought land for housing. All these years, Maendeleo Women have been fighting amongst each other and there is nothing constructive the MYWO has done, she said on Wednesday.Miyandazi said she will push for the change of name and urge members to elect development-conscious leaders.MYWO is a women s NGO that deals with rights and gender equity.
