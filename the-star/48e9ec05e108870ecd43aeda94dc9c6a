Politicians should not trade words and cause chaos as happened between Jubilee and Cord in Mathare, Nairobi, on Sunday in which a vehicle was burnt, an MP has said.Juja MP Francis Waititu said the political clash caused unnecessary tension. There is no need of fighting over a venue. We can arrange our meetings on different days, he said on Monday.Waititu faulted political leaders for planning meetings at the same time in the same venue then running away in their big cars when the chaos broke out.
