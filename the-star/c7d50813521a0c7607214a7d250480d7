Nairobi speaker Alex Magelo on Wednesday suspended the debate on governor Evans Kidero impeachment.Discussions on the motion was stopped after Kidero secured a court order on Monday.The High Court barred the assembly from discussing the Auditor General reports for the Financial Year 2013-14.They were also stopped from discussing the allegations that the governor violated the principal of public finance management.Some of the issues under probe included establishment of county attorney office, as well as alleged scuffles between Kidero and unnamed elected representative of the county government.Magelo said they will wait for further direction as the assembly prepares a response for the governor's application."I wish to give directions that order number eight (the motion) as it appears in today's order paper be suspended at the stage it is, to await further directions as the assembly responds to the application," the speaker said in a communication to the House.Magelo said it would be futile to proceed with the debate on the motion in the absence of the governor. The assembly sitting was adjourned on Tuesday for lack of quorum after all Cord and 20 Jubilee MCAs stayed away.The speaker said they will go to court to quash the order. Kidero's application will be mentioned on November 7.
