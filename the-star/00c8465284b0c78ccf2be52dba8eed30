Gor Mahia youngster Amos Nondi hopes his rise into the senior team as well as frequent call ups to the national football team Harambee Stars can inspire him to emulate Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Victor Wanyama.Nondi, who is the immediate former Harambee Stars U-20 skipper, has attributed his rise to self belief. It has been a good season for me because I have found some playing time at the club and also got several call ups to the national team. I have not yet made a break into the final squad but I am working hard to be there, Nondi said. Definitely my target is to be a regular and move into the big European Leagues like our captain Victor. I haven t had time to train with him because everytime I have been called up, he links up with the team later on. But it is something I am looking forward to; learning from him will be a big plus, the youngster stated. The attacking midfielder started his career at Gor Mahia s youth team before being loaned out to Sony Sugar last year to pick up vital Premier League experience.At the beginning of the season, he returned to Nairobi and was immediately promoted to the senior side where he has been a frequent figure on match day squad. He is still growing with a lot of potential and I am pleased with what he is doing so far. But we have to give him time. I am happy with what he is doing so far, his coach at Gor Jose Marcelo Ferreira asserted.
