ODM's disciplinary committee has told rebels to expect a "fair report" because its inquiry is not to intimidate or seal their expulsion from the party. The five-member panel chaired by Fred Athuok affirmed that listening to rebels associating themselves with rival Jubilee Party gives an opportunity to make Odm stronger by establishing and resolving issues befalling it.Athuok and committee member Farah Maalim told Star nine members from 13 grilled on Friday at a Nairobi hotel raised certain party management problems that should be resolved. "We are not going to use this opportunity to chase people away from the party or try to subject them to by-elections. There are certain areas where the party needs to make internal approaches that will stale off some of frustrations," Maalim said.Other three committee members are Mishi Mboko (Mombasa woman representative), Harold Kipchumba (nominated senator) and Halima Daro (Marsabit ODM co-ordinator).Nine members including two governors, a deputy governor and six MPs accused the committee of intimidation by subjecting them to disciplinary proceedings and violating the Constitution.They also claimed the proceedings was a "formality" because the committee announced their expulsion to Odm national executive council after failing to show cause why they should not face disciplinary action within seven days, that lapsed.Maalim said some members still love the party despite the frustrations while others have their "hearts, souls, spirit and objects somewhere else.""We have heard some members who were really frustrated by our own internal issues and according to us might have only associated with other parties out of certain frustrations," he said.The law-makers blamed party supremo leader Raila Odinga for undemocratic party nominations, sidelining them in Odm events and not funding party activities in their areas despite giving monthly contributions. They did not provide details.The committee will this week continue to grill other party rebels out of the 13 and write a report to Odm national executive council to take action. "We will have a small retreat among ourselves, write a report and submit the findings to the national executive committee. It will be a fair report and we will give the benefit of doubt to many of them," Maalim said.The panel questioned Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani and his Kwale counterpart Salim Mvurya, Kisii deputy governor Joash Maangi, MPs Steven Kariuki (Mathare), Cyprian Kubai (Igembe Central), Samuel Arama (Nakuru Town West), John Waluke (Sirisia), Isaac Mwaura (nominated) and Zainabu Chidzuga (Kwale women representative).Four MPs Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East), Gideon Mung'aro (Kilifi North), James Rege (Karachuonyo), and Mustafa Iddi (Kilifi South) did not show up but they presented written submission. The rebels' lawyer, Kioko Kilukumi told Star his next move depends on the disciplinary committee decision against his clients to Odm's NEC. If the committee recommends to expel the rebels, the decision will be effected upon ratification by NEC. It should be supported by two-thirds of the members."If that decision is ratified, my clients have a right to appeal to a Special Session of the party's national governing council to exhaust the internal mechanism," Kilukumi said. His clients' failing to get justice from internal party mechanism will prompt intervention from the political parties tribunal, high court, court of appeal and the supreme court.
