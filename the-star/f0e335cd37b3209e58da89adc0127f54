So where did Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki (pictured) vanish to? This is the question some political enthusiasts have been asking. Kindiki, a former university don, was very prominent and visible during the early days of the Jubilee Coalition. They issued joint statements with his National Assembly counterpart Aden Duale. But Kindiki is no longer heard from. It s whispered that a tycoon who backed his bid in 2013 has kept him busy on the ground. The man is reportedly threatening to end Kindiki s political career before the senator makes a stab at the presidency in 2022. It s whispered that Kindiki, Duale and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen - all senior Jubilee leaders - are finding it rough on the ground, to say the least. ************So what does Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama know about the Cord 2017 presidential flagbearer that others don t? Well, sources whisper to Corridors that the senator, who is also among the three joint chairpersons of the Cord management committee, is among the strongest believers in the opposition coalition. The Wiper elected leader and ally ofex-Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka has kept off from attacking ODM. Recently, he surprised his colleagues by insisting the Cord presidential flagbearer is already known. Kalonzo, ODM boss Raila Odinga and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang ula are all battling for the Cord ticket. Ardent allies of the three have been tearing each apart other over the issue. ************Still in Cord, a section of the leaders who recently defected from the opposition have been having sleepless nights after their attempts to reconcile with their former leader, and possibly go back home hit a brick wall. The leaders, among them governors and MPs, have been seeking this elusive audience after claiming that what they were promised in JP fell far short of their expectations. To make matters worse, they are reported to have been forced into eating plenty of humble pie, after realising that an individual who had promised to fix a meeting with the opposition coalition leader had actually conned them of huge sums of money.************So why were some 12 secretaries in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs transferred two weeks ago? Sources tell Corridors some of the secretaries were nearing retirement age. Questions of tribalism and favoritism have been raised. Some ministry staff asked Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed to take charge and restore confidence that the process was aboveboard.
