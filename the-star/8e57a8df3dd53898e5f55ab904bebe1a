Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki has told Lands CS Jacob Kaimenyi to stop being arrogant over calls to resolve Meru-Tharaka Nithi border dispute.Kindiki said that residents of the two counties had high expectations that the CS would resolve the dispute upon his appointment to the Lands ministry.At the weekend, Kaimenyi dared Kindiki to table an impeachment motion against him for failing to resolve the said dispute.Kindiki, who did not take the comments lightly, reminded Kaimenyi that he saved the CS during a censure motion against him while serving as Education CS."I stood firm when he was about to be impeached as Education CS even when some leaders in Meru county were silent on the issue," Kindiki said.He made the comments on Sunday at Ntuntuni, Chuka Igambang'ombe constituency where he presided over a fundraiser.Read: Stop threatening me with impeachment, Kaimenyi tells Kindiki"I am surprised that a committee to deal critical land matters was formed without involving me as the area's legislator," Kindiki said."I heard that he said I did not go to his office. Why should I go to his office. He is the one who is supposed to come to my office," he said.The Senator told Kaimenyi to stop engaging in 'cheap politics', citing that today's cabinet secretaries are civil servants who should not engage in petty politics."Cabinet secretaries are public servants so I don t expect Kaimenyi to engage in politics," he said.Kindiki said the CS's arrogance will do him more harm than good and therefore should go slow."We have seen CSs who had such should high handedness. He should call former Devolution CS Ann Waiguru and ask her what happened," he said.Also read: Do not fight over border, says Munya
