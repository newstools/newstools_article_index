The Central Bank of Kenya s Monetary Policy Committee meets today for the first time since the Interest Rate Capping Bill was signed into law.The International Monetary Fund's deputy managing director Mitsuhiro Furusawa said in Nairobi last week: Linking deposit and lending rates to the central bank s policy rate may compromise the independence of the central bank, and hamper its ability to enact monetary policy towards achieving its main objectives, that is to maintain price and financial stability and to support the economy. Furusawa warned that the politicisation of monetary policy bears risks for a sound financial system and for credit access, especially to risky borrowers. These would include inefficiencies in the credit market and undermining the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, said Citi Global Markets. The Citi analysts said the Kenyan situation called for a change in banking models because the extent of the rate cap was more draconian than in other countries where such restrictions have been put in place.
