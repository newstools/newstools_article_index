Kenya Power has said transformer suppliers will be required to adhere to new guidelines which have been set up in a bid to stop vandalism. The distributor said the guideline contains new specifications for transformers aimed at increasing the durability of the electrical devices, while making them less attractive to vandals. The requirement is expected to control the quality of transformers while at the same time prevent vandalism, managing director Ben Chumo said. He said this will also improve the quality of power supply in the country .Transformers will also contain aluminium windings as opposed to copper which is attractive to vandals. Suppliers will be required to provide a list of critical raw materials and their sources in order to ease traceability of parts and to control the quality of the equipment.The guidelines also require that a supplier provides a warranty of six years and five years from the date of delivery and commissioning, respectively. This will help reduce transformer failure rates and compel manufacturers to take responsibility for any manufacturing defects. This is one of deliberate steps being undertaken by the company to ensure that we offer the best service to our customers. In the past, the challenge of vandalism has adversely affected our business thus calling for innovative ways of tackling that problem, Chumo said. By requiring transformer manufacturers to reveal their source of raw materials, the company will be in a position to avoid low standard equipment that could compromise the efficiency of the network, he said.Recently, Kenya Power signed a memorandum of understanding with Toshiba Transmission &amp; Distribution Systems a subsidiary of Toshiba Corporation for a pilot installation and trial of new type of transformers with the aim of enhancing efficiency and helping to significantly reduce distribution losses.Kenya Power data shows cases of transformer vandalism have been on a decline, helped by constant surveillance on the network, enhanced penalties and jail terms for vandals.
