Botswana held 50 years of independence celebrations with cultural activities on Saturday at the Louis Leaky Auditorium Nairobi.Hosted by Botswana High Commissioner to Nairobi John Moreti, the Batwasna living and working in Nairobi and other guests were entertained by the Tswana dancers. Guests, including members of the diplomatic corps, also got an opportunity to taste some of the delicacies served in Botswana. Earlier in the day, Botswana High Commission and Know Your World Initiative, a programme that educates students on international affairs, organised a forum for students to learn more about Botswana. Students from the Technical University of Kenya, Upper Hill High School, Nembu Girls High School, Dagorreti High School and representatives from Starehe Boys' High School attended.Monica Ng'ang'a, who heads the programme, said they are working with students to help them get a better understanding of the world for them to have a global scope in solving problems. Botswana and Kenya have enjoyed friendly relations, anchored on the early government-to-government contacts at Independence and strong people-to-people connections. The two governments collaborate through formalised bilateral platforms and have also partner effectively at continental and multilateral fora to promote common interests.Ambasador Moreti said, "For many years Botswana has hosted Kenyans who continue to contribute to our development as educators, investors and government workers, among others. Kenya has since 1967 hosted Batswana trainees in various fields at its higher institutions of learning.""A very good number of the doctors, meteorologists, railway technicians, meat inspectors, journalists and other public service workers in Botswana received their training here in the country," Moreti added. President Uhuru Kenyatta in June made a state visit to Botswana where he pushed for a review of regulations that limited business and employment opportunities between Kenya and the southern African country. President Ian Khama agreed to review the rules so that Kenyans can continue accessing employment and work opportunities in the country.
