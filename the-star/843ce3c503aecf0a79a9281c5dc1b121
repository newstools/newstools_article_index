Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was expected to release a new list of potential Supreme Court nominees on Friday.NBC News said it would include US Senator Mike Lee, a prominent supporter of former Trump foe Ted Cruz.Campaign aides said the list would be announced later in the day.Trump has already released one list of conservative judges from which he said he could choose a Supreme Court justice if elected over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November 8 election.The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on February 13 left the court with a four-to-four tie between right-leaning and left-leaning justices.Democratic President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, chief judge of the US Court of Appeals in Washington, but the Republican-controlled US Senate has refused to consider confirming him.Lee, a senator from Utah, was a top supporter of US Senator Cruz of Texas, who was defeated by Trump in the Republican presidential nomination fight. Cruz has refused to endorse the New York real estate developer.Lee spokesman Conn Carroll was dismissive of being on Trump's list, telling Politico that Lee "already has the job he wants, which is why he is campaigning to represent the great people of Utah again this year."
