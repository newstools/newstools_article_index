Kenya Airways employees have opposed the move by a construction company to stop compensation of Sh2.5 billion awarded to them by an arbitrator for houses.The 312 workers say they had paid 10 per cent deposit to Epco Builders and the balance was to be released upon completion of the houses. They had entered into an agreement with the builder to construct houses on three parcels of land.The investors, through lawyer Nelson Ashitiva, told Justice Olga Osewe that Epco entered into separate agreement with individual purchasers. He said the total deposit paid by the buyers was Sh100 million.A dispute arose when the contractor demanded the balance, which was higher than what was contained in the contract. The buyers were asked to pay Sh825,000 for three-bedroom apartments and Sh575,000 for two-bedroom, which was not agreed upon, the court heard. The judgement is on November 30.
