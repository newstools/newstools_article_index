The Kiambu government and an Israeli company have partnered to help farmers improve avocado farming.Avocados are about 17 per cent of total exports in the country, mostly to the European Union. But under the Kiambu deal, this is expected to rise as there is a huge market in Israel through Guri Avocados. Kiambu Governor William Kabogo said farmers will sign contracts with the Israeli company covering all aspects of the avocado value chain.The deal also provides for a modern avocado seedling nursery. This facility will be based at the Waruhiu Agricultural Training Centre, which is managed by the county. Guri Avocados managing director Amram Cohen said his company is committed to assist Kenyan farmers. Avocados harvested by farmers contracted by Guri shall be purchased by the company, including the low-grade of the avocado crop, he said. Cohen said farmers will be paid after supplying their produce. Israel Ambassador Yahel Vilan said Israel is keen on doing business with Kenya.
