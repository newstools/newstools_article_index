Leopards dragged into relegation dogfightVery few thought with sponsors on board, Kenya s second most successful club AFC Leopards would be dragged into a relegation dogfight.But that is exactly where the 12-time top flight champions find themselves in at the start of the second leg of this year s SportPesa Premier league campaign.The 1-0 defeat they suffered at the hands of bogey side Chemelil Sugar who scored through veteram Hillary Echesa left Ingwe seven points above the drop zone and in real danger of relegation ten years afterthey returned to top flight football. That new coach Ivan Minnaert has turned to old boys Edwin Wafula, Jackson Saleh and Bernard Mangoli to turn the fortunes of the club around tells alot of what has been holding Ingwe back.A penchant for sentiment rather than reality has seen Ingwe fail to thrive in an era where rivals Gor Mahia and Tusker have bagged titles.It would be hoped that the office that comes to the helm at the end of the month will inspire the playing unit to turn around the club s fortunes.Also in the doldrums and now a prime candidate for relegation are basement side Sofapaka.The 2009 champions suffered yet another defeat this time at the hands of Western Stima that left them with a measly seven points from 16 matches. Goals from man of the match Kennedy Muguna and Fred Shimonyo rendered Noah Abich s spectacular freekick a mere consolation for Batoto Ba Mungu who are still eight points from safety having accumulated a paltry seven points from their 16 matches. Also in the bottom two are Nairobi City Stars who grabbed a point from the verge of defeat as Oliver Maloba struck at the death to cancel Francis Ocholla s 17th minute strike for Muhoroni Youth.The financially constrainedKawangware side have 11 points four behind Thika United.Thika who have enjoyed a mini revival under new coach James Nandwa were beaten 2-1 by champions Gor Mahia on Sunday. Rwandan hot shot Jacques Tuyisenge struck twice for K ogallo who moved a place to third threepoints behind league leaders Tusker. The brewers came through a tricky tie against Posta Rangers with Noah Wafula scoring the lone goal.Mathare United also enhanced their title credentials with a narrow 1-0 win over fellow title contenders Ulinzi Stars a result that took them to within two points of Tusker. Whyvonne Isuza got the goal early in the first half to leave coach Francis Kimanzi dreaming of a historic second title with the Slum Boys eight years after he led them to their maiden top flight title.
