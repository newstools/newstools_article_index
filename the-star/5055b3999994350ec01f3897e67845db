Two Western leaders have said former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende only wants to frustrate efforts by Water CS Eugene Wamalwa to become Nairobi governor.Speaking on Thursday in Bumula, MP Boniface Otsiula and former Budalang i lawmaker Raphael Wanjala said Marende joined the race after Wamalwa had been endorsed.Instead, the duo wants Marende to support Wamalwa. By joining the race, he is out to divide the Luhya votes in the city, they said.Last week, Marende declared he is in the race for Nairobi governor. Otsiula criticised Luhya leaders for fighting each other and questioned Marende s decision to join the race. I don t know what is wrong with us, Luhyas. Instead of joining hands and supporting one of our own, we are in the forefront fighting each other, he said.Wanjala said there are many seats Marende can go for, instead of opposing Wamalwa who has the backing of the top Jubilee leadership.The two leaders urged the Luhya community to reject leaders whose main aim is to thwart others success.Wanjala said the community is ill-prepared to clinch the presidency next year and a win by Wamalwa will increase his chances of ascending to the presidency.He said this time round they will ensure the community is united and urged Marende to shelve his ambitions and support the Water CS.Otsiula said if Luhya leaders continue fighting each other, they should forget about ruling the country. We shall not use our numerical superiority well if we don t unite to support one another, he said.
