Kalonzo Musyoka has asked the Kalenjin community to support his 2017 presidential bid in return for his backing for former President Daniel Moi.The Wiper leader appealed for the support saying he rallied behind Moi "when other communities rebelled"."I am going for presidency in the 2017 election and I urge the community to back me. I have been their true friend since time immemorial," the ex-VP said."To date we have no grudge. We are just in different political camps," he added during an interview with Kass FM on Wednesday.Kalonzo said he will soon tour Rift Valley to drum up support.He noted Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto are his friends but said he also wants the people to join his party and support him.The Cord co-principal further said he had no personal differences with Deputy President William Ruto, whom he termed his long-time friend.Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta launched Jubilee Party after several parties merged for its formation.Several opposition politicians have since moved to JP, through which Uhuru will seek re-election in the August 8 general election."I am aware that some leaders from my home turf have decamped to Jubilee. Though it is their democratic right they will never be re-elected," said Kalonzo.He said that he will ensure that he becomes Cord flag bearer for the presidency by convincing his co-principals Raila Odinga and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula.Kalonzo hailed his leadership as internationally recognised in the wake of his receipt of the African Dignitary Man of the Year award."I want my friends to give me a chance and I will ensure Cord wins 2017 elections," he said, adding he was sure he was "sellable".He also noted his friendship with all Kenyan communities.Read: Kalonzo feted African Dignitary Man of the YearThe Wiper leader said Cord was not divided and that the coalition's flag bearer will be fielded harmoniously.Read: Kalonzo confident he will deliver victory as Cord flag bearer in 2017Also read: Cord to pick flagbearer in January
