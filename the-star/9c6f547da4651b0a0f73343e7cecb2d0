Top Orange Democratic Movement leaders on Saturday endorsed Mombasa Woman Rep Mishi Mboko for the Likoni parliamentary seat (see page 31). These leaders included Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, who also happens to be the ODM Director of Elections.In making the endorsement, Mohamed said Mboko is the best candidate to represent the interests of Lokoni residents .Mohamed ought to know that the best judge of who the best candidate to represent their interests is remains the registered voters of Likoni at the ODM nominations in February.Mohamed s remarks constitute a failure to learn from the past. They are also deeply frustrating for many loyal ODM voters. This is the same old thing that has hurt ODM s prospects in the past and demoralized even diehard supporters. And this is only four months before the nominations are due. Flawed nominations have been the failing of all Kenyan political parties, especially ODM.Likoni-like endorsements are unacceptable.
