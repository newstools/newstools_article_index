West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo has slammed those criticising North Rift leaders opposed to Laban Ayiro's appointment as Moi University acting VC.Lonyangapuo said the appointment was unfair as it delayed to September yet the post was advertised in June. If the process was long a new Vice Chancellor should have been named by August, he said.He spoke during the 11th graduation ceremony for Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology (RVIST) in Nakuru county on Friday. SOme 1,300 students graduated.Lonyangapuo, who is a former Egerton University lecturer, said the process was delayed because someone chose to deliberately "sit on the names" of those interviewed He added that it was wrong to brand institutions tribalistic as appointments to university management positions should be purely based on merit. There's need to separate politics from the management of public institutions," he said. "I challenge boards of management of public institutions to ensure that selections for various positions are done in an open manner."Professor Ayiro, who was acting deputy vice-chancellor in charge of planning, replaced professor Richard Mibey whose term ended on September 19.He is to act for three months before the substantive VC is appointed. His appointed sparked protests by North Rift leaders including Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and Elgeyo Marakwet's Alex Tolgos.They stormed the university with MPs saying professor Isaac Kosgey should have been appointed instead, as he "topped interviews".[AUDIO] Two governors, MPs storm Moi University over new 'outsider' VC AyiroThe two were praised by some but condemned by others including Deputy President William Ruto.Ruto castigated them saying their move was reckless and uncalled for."All leaders must act responsibly when dealing with public issues," he said.
