Barely two weeks after calling off their strike, Nairobi doctors are back on the streets, accusing the county of reneging on an agreement.They resumed their strike on Saturday after suspending it on September 30, following an agreement with the county government. The doctors had been on strike for three weeks before the suspension.Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union branch secretary general Thuranira Kaugiria yesterday said, We agreed they would address all the issues we raised by October 7, but that has not happened. He said of the five issues raised in October last year, when they first issued the strike notice, only one has been addressed payment of six months delayed salary.He said only 37 of the 60 doctors on probation for more than two years have been confirmed. We hear they have promoted deserving doctors. But this is hearsay. We have not seen any letters, Kaugiria said. Health chief officer Sam Ochola said the county has addressed the issues raised.
