The Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday cut fuel prices across the board for the first time since February-March period, but warned of a possible rise next month. Super petrol dropped the most month-on-month by Sh3.74, followed by kerosene at Sh3.38 and diesel at Sh2.05, the regulator said citing reduced cost of petroleum imports and a stable shilling to the dollar. Petrol, largely used to fuel personal cars, has dropped to Sh91.39 a litre in Nairobi, Sh87.99 in Mombasa and Sh93.42 in Kisumu. The pump prices remain highest in areas farthest from the Port of Mombasa, with a litre in Mandera and Lokichogio, for example, retailing at Sh105.20 and Sh101.23, respectively. A litre of diesel, used in running of machines in transportation, farming and manufacturing, has reduced to Sh82.46 in Nairobi, while Mombasa and Kisumu residents will pay Sh79.08 and Sh84.65 respectively. Poor households who rely on kerosene for lighting and cooking, will now pay Sh59.10, Sh56.27 and Sh61.06 a litre in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, respectively.Kenya imports refined fuel since shutting down the Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd in September 2013 after the government fell out with its co-owner, India's Essar Energy, which has since exited.A litre of refined petrol cost Sh37.18 at the port, but rose to Sh91.39 in Nairobi. This is mainly due to fixed Sh38.92 in taxes and levies, Sh10.89 margin for marketers and, Sh4.40 in distribution and storage costs, ERC said.The government pockets Sh38.92 for every litre of petrol sold in Nairobi and Sh29.35 for diesel, while kerosene attracts Sh8.17 since it is exempted from the Sh18 Roads Maintenance Levy. A tonne of petrol at the port declined by 8.86 per cent to $475.48 (Sh48,223), diesel by 5.95 per cent to $441.19 (Sh44,745), while kerosene cost 8.52 per cent less to $451.77(Sh45,819) when it landed in Mombasa. The shilling remained stable to the US dollar in August to exchange at average of 101.42 units a marginal 0.03 per cent depreciation compared with 101.39 average in July. The ERC hinted at a price hike next month, pointing out that a barrel of Murban crude oil rose 2.58 per cent in August to $45.75 (Sh4,640). There is usually a time lag of 30 to 40 days from the time an oil marketer makes an order to the time the petroleum products are delivered at the Mombasa port. Accordingly, the effects of the increase in crude oil prices will be realised locally in subsequent pricing cycle, ERC director for renewable energy Pavel Oimeke said in a statement.
