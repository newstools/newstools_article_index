A leadership wrangle is simmering at the Amani party Vihiga branch after executive committee members, led by Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, elected Julius Ochiel as the chairman without incumbent Asena Muyoma's knowledge.On Thursday, secretary general William Kaisha read a press statement saying Muyoma voluntarily resigned "for personal reasons".But Muyoma denied the claims, saying he is still the chairman and if there was any resignation, he was the one who would announce it.He said Agoi had asked him to resign to pave way for Ochiel whose name was fronted by Emuhaya MP Wilberforce Otchilo."They want to sacrifice me by bringing in Ochiel because Otichilo said he wants his tribesman to welcome him in the party," Muyoma said.He added that he is the one who pushed Otichilo to join ANC only to learn that people wants to sacrifice him."I have not resigned, I was elected to serve the interests of the party, all this thigs are done behind my back, why didnt they invite me when they were making this decisions" said Muyoma.However, Ochiel said he was unanimously elected by branch executive because of his experience in various capacity including serving as the National Organizing Secretary for both KADU and FORD Kenya.The former AFC Leopards leopard Chairman says he was brought make ANC vibrant in the county.Asked if Otichilo proposed his name for the seat Ochiel said " I belive he {Otichilo} knows he should be in ANC if he wants to be the Governor here."He said his election will bring equal representation in the region.Both OChiel and Muyoma spoke to the Star through phone.ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi comes from Vihiga.
