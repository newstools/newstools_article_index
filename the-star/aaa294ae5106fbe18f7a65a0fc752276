The IEBC is consulting on new timelines for the 2017 general election and will release a revised road map in due course.Communication officer Andrew Limo said on Thursday that they were holding consultative meetings on the new law.Election Laws (Amendment) Act 2016 came into force on October 4 ushering in a broad range of electoral reforms.These include a new framework for the recruitment of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioners."It will require some adjustments to the schedule of activities," read the statement.The commissioner said via Twitter that it was engaging stakeholders to ensure they are all on board.The commission said on September 30 that August 8 will remain as the date for next year's election but asked for goodwill and support to ensure plans are completed by then.Questions have been raised on whether a new set of commissioners and a Supreme Court chief justice will be in office by then.The commission is also yet to invest in electoral kits and biometric systems for an efficient process.Read: IEBC sets August 8 as 2017 general election dateAlso read: IEBC stands ground on August 8 election dateMPs tryied to change the election date to December 2017 but the vote failed in the National Assembly.Attorney General Githu Muigai asked them to consider pushing the date back to allow proper reconstitution of the electoral commission and adequate preparation.Muigai said changing the election date does not require a referendum. He did not suggest a new date. The AG based his proposal on a report by a commission chaired by Justice Johann Kriegler on managing elections after the disputed 2007 polls.The report says a free, fair and credible election can only take place if the electoral commission has been in place for at least two years before polls.Read: AG asks Parliament to push back 2017 poll over IEBCAlso read:IEBC To Buy New Poll Gadgets For 2017
