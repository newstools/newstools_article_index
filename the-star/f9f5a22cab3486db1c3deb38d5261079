The Mombasa county government will soon start benefiting from the revenue collected at the Kenya Ports Authority if a report by the Inter-Governmental Committee is tabled and adopted.Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar yesterday said the committee has recommended that the county must benefit from the billions collected annually at the port.Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and local leaders have been calling for the devolution of the port in accordance to the constitution. [ The constitution classifies the port of Mombasa as a national resource].However, the national government has insisted that the Mombasa port is a national asset and should benefit the whole country.Speaking during a multi-sectoral meeting on finance to review the Mombasa budget making process, Omar said the committee's recommendations are good news to the county.The committee, which also brings on board the Commission on Revenue Authority, the Controller of Budget and other finance institutions, concluded Mombasa needs to get a share from the port. They (Committee) have concluded the port is a national asset, which for me is sad, but they have suggested there must be solid returns, in terms of pressure and obvious interruptions the port has on social, economic and political fabrics in the county, Omar said.He said there is now a concurrence that a certain level of revenue percentage from the port should be channeled back to the county.The report, which is now ready to be tabled, will be taken to the Summit chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta for deliberation and adoption.In the Summit consists of the President and all the 47 governors. We are however calling for good management of this huge amount, he said.He suggested that the county should get 40 per cent of the total revenue collected, while the national government takes the remaining 60 per cent. In my assessment I have proposed 40 per cent, but we all know that figure will be brought down. However, it will be foolhardy to suggest 20 per cent, which will eventually brought down to 10 per cent, the Senator said.He said this should be implemented as soon as possible so that Mombasa can be able to develop, especially around the port.
