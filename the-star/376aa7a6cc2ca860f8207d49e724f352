Senate Deputy Speaker Kembi Gitura yesterday gave the office of the clerk up to Tuesday next week to brief the House on the status of all petitions. There are more than 25 petitions in various committees.Most of them are before the Committee on Public Finance and Commerce and the Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee. Three weeks ago, senators accused Public Finance Committee chairman Billow Kerrow of not calling meetings to deal with the petitions.While Senate Standing Orders require that petitions must be dispensed with and a report tabled in the House within 60 days, the committee members questioned why petitions against Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka and his Vihiga counterpart Moses Akaranga have not been concluded, long past the stipulated time.Notably, the petition against the Vihiga county executive was said to have been lying before the committee for the last six months.
