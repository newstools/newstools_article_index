Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has urged his country's entrepreneurs to invest heavily in Kenya as the country is endowed, the people talented and the President ready.Noting his government has strategic national and global interests in Kenya s prosperity, he said it would only be prudent to use opportunities in East Africa s largest economy."Come and invest in Kenya. The opportunities are great. There is an inflection point where the economy can take off. You can be part of the yeast in this cake," he said.Netanyahu also asked county governments to partner with the Israeli investors willing to share their expertise and experience in economic development.He said Kenya and Israel are ready to reduce any arising business risks. He spoke at Villa Rosa Kempinski hotel in Nairobi where he and President Uhuru Kenyatta addressed a Kenya-Israel business forum.More than 70 business leaders in the PM's entourage explored profitable partnerships with their Kenyan counterparts.The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry said deals worth more than Sh2 billion were signed on Tuesday before the two leaders officially opened the forum.The President said his government's main objective is to expand and improve the country s economy for the sake of future generations.He told Israeli entrepreneurs seeking to invest in the country that they are not only guaranteed short term gains but long term profits.Uhuru pointed out that the country has a wealth of natural resources including a young and dynamic population and a strategic geographical location which is an access point to a market of more than 600 million people."We are doing our best to harness that latent potential through the regional infrastructure projects we are pursuing...so that they are empowered to pursue their potential," he said.Uhuru said the venture will be possible through the internal roads infrastructure , the Standard Gauge railway line, the unparalleled investments in energy, and steps Kenya is taking in social security, health and education.The President said the government is reforming the education sector and reinvigorating the NYS to raise a generation of lateral thinkers, problem solvers and risk takers."We are working to ensure our education evolves to meet the needs of our local market and the global market of the 21st century. That s another area where I hope we will learn from Israel," Uhuru said.He said the phenomenon of Israel s economic success remains a global inspiration and speaks to many countries including Kenya."Through innovation, and sheer force of will you powered your way to be a premier economy in the world, a leader in technology and a country where enterprise is not just encouraged but emboldened and rewarded; where commerce is coded into your very culture; where entrepreneurship is not just something you do, but who you are," he said.Uhuru said the two nations have not yet exploited their full extent of economic cooperation. He said Netanyahu's visit provides a platform to pursue the many business opportunities the two nations offer.
