MP Reginalda Wanyonyi has asked Cord leaders to stop threatening elected members who defected to Jubilee with by-elections.The Bungoma woman representative said MPs and governors who ditched the opposition exercised their democratic right.She said they were not ignorant of the law and that they made their moves knowing time had elapsed.Noting the next general election is less than 10 months away, Wanyonyi said it was improper for Cord leaders to call for mini polls.''Let Cord allow the country to prepare for the major election in 2017," she said at a function in Bumula constituency on Saturday.She added that it would be wasteful for the government to hold more than 20 by-elections, yet they will be needed for the August poll.''Let the Cord principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang'ula find out why they are losing their members to Jubilee," she said.Read: ODM writes warning letters to 13 MPs, governors who defected to JubileeAlso read: ODM wants by-elections for defectors Speaking separately, Chuka Igambang ombe MP Muthomi Njuki said Cord should stop using propaganda to deceive Kenyans.He said at Mugwe Primary school that the mini polls the coalition has called for will likely be staged three to four months to the general election which is against the law.The law states by-elections cannot be held less than six months to the general election. "The reason why there was a delay in merging Jubilee affiliate parties was to allow all elected leaders to move to other parties without losing their seats," Njuki said.The legislator said members of parliament who have defected should stand firm as it is not possible to hold by-elections at the moment."Those are empty threats that only cowards can listen to. We are likely to see more and more defections as we gear towards August 2017," he said.Njuki said Jubilee Party will have an advantage over Cord as it will field single candidates for all seats.He dismissed claims there will be fall-outs leading to massive exodus from the new party over nomination."The recent wrangles witnessed in Embu county show there is a lot of hope. That s why people are fighting for positions," the MP said.Read: Why Cord should proceed with caution
