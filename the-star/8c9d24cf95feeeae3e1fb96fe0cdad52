A Kajiado MCA was almost reduced to nothing at Kimana Mixed Secondary School after he attempted to commission a new laboratory, a project of Kajiado government.Witnesses said Kimana MCA, James Kuya, had a plaque made, complete with his name and title, in readiness for the function when Governor David Nkedianye arrived in a convoy of cars.Governors are mandated by the law to commission such projects, and in their absence they can assign the job to their executives. The people who had attended the event said Kuya wanted to open the laboratory without involving the county government. You should not be involved in our politics. You re like your brother Daniel Nina. How do you come and open classes without informing me yet I am the governor of this county. Is that right? Do not lie to wananchi that you control the project. Your job is just to oversee projects, the irate governor said. Nina wants to run for Kajiado governor.The governor said if President Uhuru Kenyatta arrived in Kajiado and called him (Nkedianye), he would drop everything and attend to him. But to save Kuya from embarrassment, the governor asked him to open the laboratory, saying he did so out of respect for the people present at the function.
