Just why did President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto decide to give the official opening ceremony of the refurbished Nairobi county assembly a wide birth? We are told both the President and his Deputy were afraid that a group of MCAs had planned to heckle them for reasons known only to the would-be hecklers.***********Kenyanjournalists must be breathing a sigh of relief after TICAD VI finally came to an end on Sunday. Corridors has learnt that local journalists had a difficult time covering the high-profile event at the KICC, where the Japanese were running the show. Foreign Journalists were allowed to access numerous events but Kenyans would only be told to choose one event per day. It was so bad that even after accessing the event, they had to wait to be called to assemble at the Information desk before being escorted in and out of the venue, unlike previous events such as UNCTAD, where it was easy to access several forums a day. One photographer was overheard complaining how he was even escorted to the toilet by a Japanese official who waited at the door until he came out. Such behaviours are why Japan will always lose to China when it comes to development projects in Kenya, another journalist said grimly. The aggrieved journalists are also wondering how one of their own who lost a laptop and camera lens at the venue was told by the police that the CCTV in the area he had left his equipment to dash for a picture opportunity was out of order.The aggrieved local journalists have vowed to boycott future international forums if they are treated the way they were at the two-day weekend summit.*************
