The International Monetary Fund's Africa head Abebe Aemro Selassie said the following at the end of last week in Washington.''Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa this year is set to drop to its lowest level in more than 20 years. We are, at the moment, projecting close to the order of 1.4 percent as you will have seen, lower than last year's 3.5 percent and indeed, much below the five percent and more that the region was enjoying between 2010 and 2014''''Wrapping up, I would like to stress that we view Sub-Saharan Africa as a region of immense economic potential, but in some cases, this potential has been stymied at the moment by elevated macroeconomic imbalances and rising policy uncertainty. Addressing these challenges promptly and forcefully will be important in the coming months''Kenya is projecting to grow at 6 per cent in 2017.Sterling is trying to find a footing after a precipitous fall last week to trade just above the 1.24 level versus the dollar.New York crude oil pushed through the $50.00 a barrel level to trade at 50.52 last.The Nairobi All Share eased a marginal 0.02 points to close at 138.15.The Nairobi NSE20 edged -2.41 points lower to close at 3258.93.Equity turnover was muscular and clocked Sh1.010 billion with Safaricom transacting 75% of that, Safaricom saw heavy volume action and traded 37.949 million shares worth Sh777.246 million and closed unchanged at Sh20.25.
