The first woman to unveil a political party on ODM leader Raila Odinga s home turf will go head-to-head with incumbent Rose Nyamunga and Rosa Buyu for the woman representative post. Grace Akumu formed the Citizens Convention Party two years ago. She is the widow of former Nyakach MP and Cotu secretary general Dennis Akumu. Buyu is ODM deputy organising secretary. Kisumu Tourism executive Rose Kisia and her Education counterpart Jennifer Kere are also said to be interested but they have not officially announced their bids. But in a text message, Kisia said, No. When the whistle is blown [when the official campaign period is announced] I will consider [running for] senator . Kisia lost to Nyamunga in the March 4, 2013, general election. Kere did not confirm or deny if she is interested. Akumu lost the Nyakach seat in 2013 to Aduma Owuor.
