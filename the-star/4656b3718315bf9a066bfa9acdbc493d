The state should stop the tribal audit of employees as it encourages ethnicity and demoralises small communities that have few slots in government jobs, a task force official has said.National Task Force on Community Policing chairman Joseph Kaguthi said Kenyans from the ethnic groups with most government workers are not spared in the wrath of ethnic grouping, as they are denied state jobs.State agencies concerned with ethnic auditing, such as the Auditor General s office, have misused public cash, which only promotes tribalism and hinders peaceful coexistence between communities, he said. Not enough reason can be given to justify why ethnic auditing of employees is done. It s a waste of time and resources that can be channelled to other meaningful projects, Kaguthi said.He spoke on Wednesday at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation offices in Murang a during the opening ceremony of chiefs training on ICT.The chairman said that instead of widening divisions and creating hatred among communities, the state should encourage team work regardless of ethnic backgrounds. It was the same case with the Americans when they divided themselves into racial groups. They realised the apathy they were creating among themselves and abandoned the racial culture and came up with the rule of merit, where everyone was included in government activities regardless of their race. Now America is leading in development, Kaguthi said.He urged Kenyans to work together and stop being divided along ethnic, religious or racial lines.Meanwhile, the chairman emphasised the importance of upholding the Nyumba Kumi neighbourhood watch initiative to streamline governance and maintain peace and security.He said the initiative has prevented extremism and petty crimes. Nyumba Kumi and community policing have reduced crimes and disorder at the grassroots and we want to take it to a higher level by training chiefs on the use of social media platforms to ease administration. All Kenyans must uphold the initiative to maintain peace and tranquility, Kaguthi said.He said the initiative had flopped in most parts of Central Kenya because there was no regional coordinator, but with his presence the clusters will be restructured.The 150 chiefs from 15 counties are on a three-day training on the use of ICT in administration.
