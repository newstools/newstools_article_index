Residents of Kabete, Kiambu county, have urged their MP Ferdinand Waititu to start holding meetings regarding development of the constituency.They said they hardly see him and he has no time for them. Residents spoke at a meeting in Ruku yesterday.Residents claimed the legislator has created a gap between him and them as he tours other constituencies to campaign for 2017. Waititu wants to run for governor next year.Resident Alice Wambui said the lawmaker, popularly known as Baba Yao, is well-known for his fearless style of leadership since he was a councillor and MP for Embakasi.He has, however, not shown the same leadership in Kabete, residents said. We elected Waititu to serve us but he has little time for us. He started his campaign for governor the moment he was elected, Wambui said.Edward Mathu said they want to discuss all projects their MP has done and those that were started by former MP George Muchai. Waititu was elected in a by-election on May 4 last year, following Muchai s murder on February 7 last year.Mathu said, We want our people to know where they are headed. It is us who can campaign for him. We are his judges because he has served us. Waititu s office has dismissed allegations of a gap between him and residents. Office assistant Simon Ngugi said residents have been served well and projects that benefit them have been implemented, including road upgrades and water provision. It is a fact that Waititu is a busy leader. We must appreciate he attends Parliament and supports President Uhuru Kenyatta openly. We suspect the calls to meet the people are political, but the MP has his plans, he said.Ngugi said parliamentary auditors listed Kabete NG-CDF as among the best in the country in awarding of bursaries, Uwezo Fund cash and other community projects.He encouraged people to attend meetings when they are announced. Ngugi said the MP held a development meeting in Wangige on August 26, which leaders and residents attended.
