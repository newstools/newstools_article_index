In one of the very few public lectures he has given since his retirement, President Mwai Kibaki claimed that one of the reasons why Kenya has remained relatively peaceful and prosperous is that Kenyan leaders have a capacity for compromise which always comes to the fore when there is a crisis.And he should know.Consider the details revealed in The Flame of Freedom, Raila Odinga s autobiography. Raila was Kibaki s archrival and Prime Minister during the President s second term.From this source among others we know that the difficult task of creating the Grand Coalition government of 2008 was only achieved when Kibaki and Raila went to the Sagana State Lodge for private consultations, away from their many advisers.Well, the opposition coalition co-principals , Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang ula and Raila, are, right now, very much in need of this gift for compromise. For each one of them has legions of supporters determined to see our man as the candidate of the joint opposition.At this point in time, it is a perfectly valid assessment to express doubts that they will actually come to any kind of compromise. But the opposition chiefs have the winds of history on their side, blowing in their favour.In the first two presidential elections following the return to multiparty democracy in 1991, it was virtually impossible to persuade any major political figure in the opposition to give way to the ambitions of some other candidate. The mere possibility of running for president against the entrenched incumbent, Daniel Moi, then well past his first 10 years in office was such a novelty that everyone who thought he or she had a chance was determined to run.But after two defeats at the hands of the all-powerful incumbent, the opposition politicians were forced to concede that maybe it was better to be a key figure in a government in which one of your former political rivals was president, than to remain out in the cold indefinitely.Thus in 2002, in 2007, and in 2013, we had men who already had well-publicized presidential ambitions of their own willingly stepping down to allow some other leader to be the sole opposition candidate for president.And though it is in no way clear what the current lot of opposition leaders are thinking, we can be pretty sure that they are likely to find some way to reach a compromise on who among them should run against President Uhuru Kenyatta.
