ODM has no preferred candidate for the Kisauni parliamentary and Mombasa governor seats, MP Rashid Bedzimba said yesterday.Bedzimba said, I m ready to face any person at the party primaries. We all know even Cord, as a coalition, does not have any preferred presidential candidate. He said ODM leader Raila Odinga will battle for the flag bearer position with Moses Wetang ula (Ford Kenya) and Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper). Bedzimba, a great ally of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, said ODM is a democratic party which will give fair and transparent opportunities to everyone.Bedzimba issued grants to small-scale traders at the Kisauni CDF office. He said next elections will be a walk in the park for him.Bedzimba issued Sh500,000 to some 300 women and youth to start businesses in Kisauni. The money was from his pocket, not the CDF kitty, he said.The MP said the youth need to be empowered to ensure they do not engage in crime.
