President Uhuru Kenyatta has invited his Tanzanian counterpart John Magufuli for a state visit.Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed yesterday said the invitation has been delivered and Kenya is only waiting for Tanzania to confirm when. Magufuli has expressed his desire to visit Kenya, Mohamed said in New York, where she is attending the United Nations General Assembly. Since his election early this year, Magufuli has taken steps that have raised questions regarding his relationship with Kenya.Apart from his officials detaining the Energy CS for hours in Tanga over a new pipeline from Uganda, Magufuli also preferred to send his Prime Minister to the TICAD conference. In business, Tanzania has convinced Rwanda to partner with her in constructing a new railway line between the two countries.
