A Makueni MCA on Wednesday withdrew his motion proposing construction of a strategic grain reserve. This is after the ward representatives said it is not a priority. Kithungo-Kitundu MCA Keli Musyoka on Thursday said, It is obvious that in Makueni county, we do not have enough cereal produce in the first place. The area is not agriculturally productive to yield enough cereals to put in the proposed reserve. Muungano nominated MCA Janet Kitung a told the house it would be useless to build a reserve because farmers sell the little they produce to cater for their needs. Makueni already has a small store that is ever empty. We don t need others stores, she said.Kitung a said a bill should be tabled to fund farmers projects. Temporary speaker Julius Mwalala backed the withdrawal of the motion.
