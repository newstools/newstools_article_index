Majority of small and medium enterprises are unable to easily access funding, putting their growth and development in jeopardy.According to a report unveiled yesterday by business consultancy firm Intellect, 68 per cent of SMEs in Kenya still have a notable credit gap estimated at $5 billion (Sh500 billion).SMEs account for 80 per cent of the country's employment and 20 per cent of Gross Domestic Product. The Intellect research report shows most local SMEs are sustained through self financing where 50 per cent have never approached a bank, while only 36 per cent have access to loans.The study further notes that while angel and seed investing trend is on the rise locally, only two per cent of Kenyan start-ups are funded by angel investors, most of which are in the ICT sector.
