American RnB star was in Nairobi for less than a week for his recording of the new season of Coke Studio Africa.The baby faced singer known for hits like Na Na, Heart Attack, About You and Slow Motion caused quite a furore online when he rode in a matatu. Like that is not enough, he toped trends again by strolling around the central business district, taking photos and hanging out with the watus.One female fan who took a selfie with him told Word Is, "I saw someone who looks like Trey Songz on Sunday. I told my pal, 'That is Trey Songz, we have to get a selfie.' We stood there as took photos and he saw us staring. He smiled and that was my cue to ask for the selfie."Trey posted a photo with a street child who was begging and detailed how he gave away Sh5,000 to the kid. What ensured after the post was a back an forth between fans who debated this gesture.Anyhow, the award winning musician was in town for the fourth season of the Pan African show that saw him collaborate with Kenyan rapper Nyashinski and other African acts like Yemi Alade, Serge Bernard, Stone Bwouy and Vanessa Mdee among others.After a week of hard work, Trey together with all the stars, converged for a private party hosted at the Coca Cola headquarters. The invite only guest list was littered with names from the who is who in the entertainment and corporate field.Here are photos from the launch of Coke Studio Africa. PHOTOS/ Brian Simiyu
