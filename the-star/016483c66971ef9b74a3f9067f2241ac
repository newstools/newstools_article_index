Police who were on routine patrol at Mwitoti market were alerted by a watchman who said he saw men breaking into a shop and that they had not come out," he said.Ogutu said those who escaped had been taking goods out of the shop through a back door.He said Daddy hid behind a counter after realising he was alone but that the officers found him.He was asked to surrender but made for the rooftop in an attempt at escaping, forcing the officers to shoot, he said.The police commander said the gang took advantage of business operators who closed their shops to watch a football game. And because it was raining they thought they would operate without being noticed, he said.They recovered a hacksaw, which was used to cut padlocks, and items stolen from the shops and packed in sacks.Ogutu said the slain suspect was a known criminal who hailed from Eshikumulo village in Eluche sublocation.He said Daddy dropped out of Eluche Primary School and was once a member of a gang that attacked Chinese nationals who were installing water pipes at Shianda market.Area assistant chief Ismail Eshikumo said several crimes had been reported in the area. People had feared putting up business in Mwitoti until 2010 when we established the Administration Police camp," he said.The body was taken to St Mary s hospital mortuary.
