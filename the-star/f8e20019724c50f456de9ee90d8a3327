The Kisumu county assembly has dismissed allegations it is planning to renovate the premises at Sh40 million.Clerk Phillip Adundo said claims that the revamp will cost that much were untrue, baseless, malicious and aimed at tarnishing the assembly s image.He told the media in his office on Tuesday that the ongoing project will cost Sh8 million.Adundo said the false reports were being peddled by "malicious people" out to discredit the "wonderful renovation".He noted the project will see the installation of a handsard system, a carpet, chairs, tables and air conditioners in the assembly.The clerk also dismissed a letter questioning the renovation, said to have originated from Finance and Economic Planning executive George Ongaya. It questioned the county assembly's failure to follow procurement regulations. It further said the renovation was against Public Finance Management Act regulation 114 (3).The letter was copied to Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, county assembly speaker Anne Adul and majority leader Merlin Olero. The letter is malicious and its authenticity is questionable. I personally asked the executive member... He said he was not aware of such a letter, said Adundo. Even the manner in which it was presented to me was suspicious."Read: Kisumu reps don t have chamber to hold sessionsAdundo further noted due process was strictly followed in awarding the tender for the renovation.This was contrary to a letter dated September 13 by Ongaya to the clerk, that stated this was not the case.The tender was allegedly awarded to an individual despite the promise of an advertisement and a competitive bidding process.Ongaya did not respond to calls and messages for comment.Kisumu residents have, on several occasions, questioned continued renovation of assembly, accusing the county government of misusing public funds.In 2014, the assembly's Transport and Public Workers committee questioned a Sh11.9 million contract for renovating and fencing assembly offices.A report tabled in the assembly by the committee chairman John Osumba showed that the tenders were not procedurally awarded.In-depth Stationary Company was awarded a tender to put up the administration block at a cost of Sh4.9 million, and Siluma Enterprises for work on the speaker's office at Sh3 million.The tenders were awarded on June 24, 2013 and signed on August 13.A proposal in the previous financial year for the renovation for the construction of new premises at Sh800 million was rejected by residents.Read: New chamber to cost Kisumu Sh800 millionA report by the Budget and Appropriation Accounts Committee on the supplementary budget for the 2013-14 financial year showed the amount included demolition costs, construction work and overheads.
