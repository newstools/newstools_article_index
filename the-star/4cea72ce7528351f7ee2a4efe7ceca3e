Unscrupulous butchers who steal and slaughter donkeys at night have turned to stealing and slaughtering uninspected cattle to avoid being arrested.This is because public health officials in Nairobi have started inspecting meat in all eateries, butcher Anthony Njoroge said on Saturday. He said illegal butchers have tarnished their names.Njoroge spoke in Utugi village, where three dairy cows were slaughtered by robbers at 3am.Lari AP boss Martin Waititu said the watchman of Utugi Primary School raised the alarm when he saw the animals being killed. The robbers abandoned the meat.Owner Peter Ihiga said the cows were worth Sh120,000. But villagers gave him Sh2,445 for the meat after a vet certified it safe for consumption.
