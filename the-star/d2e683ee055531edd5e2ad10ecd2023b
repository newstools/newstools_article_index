Former AFC Leopards treasurer Dr Anthony Walela has called on the Bungoma County government to upgrade the Kanduyi Masinde Muliro stadium to the required standard in order to be hosting Nzoia Sugar Football Club.Speaking in Bungoma town, Dr Walela said owing to the fact Nzoia Sugar FC are on form and could be joining the SportPesa Premier League next season it was important they have a stadium.The team has been using the Mumias Complex in the GOtv Shield championships after Kanduyi was declared unfit to host matches. He said Nzoia Sugar FC supporters have been exporting cash to another county.The Bungoma County government has already erected a perimeter wall around the stadium but Walela noted much still remains to be done to the field to acquire the status required by the premier league. We are asking those concerned to refurbish the stadium on time so that come February next year, the stadium will be in good condition to host Kenya Premier League matches because we are very optimistic Nzoia will bounce back to the top tier league."Meanwhile Eight matches are on the card this weekend as the National Super League enters round 26.League leaders Nzoia United will face off with Wazito at Kasarani tomorrow (Saturday).The Bernard Mwalala coached Nzoia will seek to extend their lead on top of the table.
