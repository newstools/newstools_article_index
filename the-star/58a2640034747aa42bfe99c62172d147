The Judicial Service Commission is likely to dismiss a petition filed against Chief Registrar of the Judiciary Anne Amadi (pictured) after the petitioner failed to produce the required information.Joseph Njuguna, who accuses Amadi of misconduct, was required by the JSC to provide more information a month ago. Kindly supply us with copies of the letters referred to in your affidavit... we shall appreciate if we could have the said letters by September 19, 2016, the letter addressed to Njuguna and signed by Fridah Mokaya, the registrar of the JSC reads.Njuguna filed the petition with the JSC last month, but the commission has not been able to proceed, because he has not been able to provide the required evidence to support his claims.In the petition, Njuguna wants Amadi removed from office for allegedly abusing her powers by issuing a directive to the Government Printer to publish notices announcing vacancies for the positions of the Chief Justice, the Deputy Chief Justice and a Supreme Court judge.He argued that the affidavit sworn by the CRJ was not in order as the Supreme Court had not delivered its ruling on the retirement case against then Deputy Chief Justice Kalpana Rawal and Supreme Court judge Philip Tunoi.Njuguna wants the JSC to determine whether it is in order to have a registrar, who is not impartial on matters that affect the commission, whether she falsely swore an affidavit and whether she abused her authority to meddle in the JSC process in the Supreme Court case.
