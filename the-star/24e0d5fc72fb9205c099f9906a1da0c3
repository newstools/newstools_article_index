Cord must take on a clear strategy including new faces to kick Jubilee Party out of power in 2017, Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said.Savula said a change of tack is required in the opposition coalition headed by Raila Odinga, and co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya). We have less than one year to the elections. The opposition needs to consolidate and agree on an appropriate formula to pick a presidential candidate, he said.All three Cord leaders have declared they will be on the presidential ballot for the August 8 general election, but several politicians have criticised them this is a recipe for failure.Savula told the Star by phone that Cord cannot present the "same faces" it did in the March 4, 2013 general election.

Their other option is to negotiate with Jubilee or Cord coalitions and support whichever offers a better deal. If none is the best option, we shall sit down as Luhya leaders and decide the direction we shall take, he said.
