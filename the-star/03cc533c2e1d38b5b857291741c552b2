They have contributed to the mismanagement of party affairs in the grassroots leading to the closure of party offices," he said.He said they are demanding the Kilifi chairman and governor to open party offices in all the seven constituencies of the county."It's annoying to see other leaders encouraging residents to register as voters but in Kilifi, leaders will only appear during nominations. We will not allow them to mislead [Raila] for their own gains," Kiir said.Also read: Coast MPs, governors to fight over Malindi seatPaul Mzungu said the current leadership is only good at ferrying supporters during Raila's visits. He said after the by-election, ODM failed to honour promises made to supporters."Even the candidates who went on nominations during the Malindi by election were told to support the ODM candidate and promised jobs in the county none of them has been employed, " he said."The truth is that all is not well with the ODM party. Elected leaders need to call an urgent meeting and include delegated to address the issues," he added.Mzungu said if the party fails to address issues raised by supporters then they would have no choice but to leave ODM."We will only vote for the presidential candidate Raila Odinga and elect other leaders from other parties to teach them a lesson," he said.He said the biggest beneficiary of the fallout will be Jubilee.Also read: Jubilee wins big in Coast as Mvurya ditches ODMJubilee intends to open offices in all the seven constituencies in Kilifi county and have already started erecting billboards in major towns including Malindi.More on this: Uhuru commends Coast leaders for working with JubileeThe region is generally considered to be an opposition stronghold.During the 2013 general elections, all the elected MPs and five MCAs won on an ODM ticket.The Tuesday protests may spell doom for Raila's party as Malindi may no longer go by the six-piece vote of the previous election.
