A 50-year-old artisan has accused the Machakos government of frustrating his efforts to earn a living. Slota Slum resident Zakaya Ndawa yesterday told the Star he is unable to sell his handcrafts due to harassment from the county s revenue collection officers. He said the officers have confiscated his wares worth Sh8,000, after they found him selling them on Mombasa Road, Athi River town.Ndawa said the officers want him to open a premise, register a business and remit revenue to the county government, which he cannot afford. He urged the county to allow him sell his wares to fend for his two wives and six children. I am poor and cannot afford to buy materials for making the handcrafts, I recycle livestock hide and scrap metals to make my wares, Ndawa said.
