The Independent Medical Legal Unit will scale up its monitoring of torture by police during the campaigns. IMLU chief executive Peter Kiamah said police have in the past gone scot-free after torturing people due to lax monitoring.He spoke during a journalists workshop at the Jumuia Conference Centre, Limuru. Police keep denying their acts of torture but IMLU will continue to pressure them to be accountable for their actions when they torture citizens, Kiamah said.He urged human rights defenders and journalists to be vigilant and highlight such incidences. Kiamah said the current scramble for investment opportunities and resources by other countries is creating ground for torture. Human rights are being trampled upon by investors from other countries. The scramble for resources is the next frontier of human rights violations by breaching the community resources rights, he said. He said they have launched a mobile phone application called Ripoti, which will be used to monitor cases of torture.
