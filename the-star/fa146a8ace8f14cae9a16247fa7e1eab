Kenya Volleyball Federation secretary general Ben Juma has thanked the intyernational volleyball federation FIVB for exempting Kenya from relegation. We are grateful to FIVB, for exempting Kenya in the changes they did on Wednesday, he said. However, I believe our objective is to remain competitive and the urge to feature in all the available FIVB calendar activities has given us the edge. We are happy that our players will once again have the chance to play against the top ranked teams, Asked about the money KVF owe FIVB, the official said they still remain in talks with the world volleyball governing body. We owe FIVB Sh7.7 million and that s a lot of money. We are still in talks with them and hopefully we will reach an understanding. However we are still open to sponsors and well wishers to come on board and help promote the sport. The World Grand Prix Council while conducting a draw on Wednesday at the FIVB head quarters in Lausanne decided to reinstate Kenya in group 2 a development FIVB president Ary Graca said was geared towards future development of the competition.
