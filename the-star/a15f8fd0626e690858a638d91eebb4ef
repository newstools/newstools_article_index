Nairobi county paid doctors on Friday as promised, Governor Evans Kidero has said and dismissed claims by the union that this was not the case.Kidero said on Wednesday that 36 interns who completed their programmes were paid through vouchers."We agreed with them that the balance of the arrears will be paid with September salaries which we are processing," he said.He asked the doctor's union to stop politicising the issue and return to work to keep from paralysing the health sector.Read: [VIDEO] Kidero promises to pay doctors by Friday, strike called offKidero had promised to ensure striking doctors got their allowances, salary arrears and promotion letters by the end of last week.But doctor s union secretary general Ouma Oluga claimed on Tuesday that they were yet to be paid despite agreeing with the Governor on a working formula."No doctor has received salaries despite the Employment and Labour Relations Court's suspension of our strike," said Oluga."We are still waiting... I do not know how our members can commute to work without money."Health services in some Nairobi hospitals have been paralysed following a silent protest by doctors demanding their pay for the last six months.They also said promotions were delayed and that about 128 doctors have not been promoted since 2011.The Nairobi government had threatened disciplinary action if the doctors did not resume duty but they dared Kidero to replace them with interns.Read: Patients seek treatment in Kiambu as doctors go on strikeAlso read: Nairobi doctors refuse to resume duty, dare county to hire interns
