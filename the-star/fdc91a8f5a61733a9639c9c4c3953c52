Crucial Directorate of Criminal Investigations operations are likely to stall following a memo to all DCI bosses countrywide early last week.The memo about a new requirement by Treasury before disbursing funds is dated September 9 and addressed to the Kenya Airports Police Unit head of DCI. Others copied are Railways DCI boss, DCI Training School commander and all section heads at DCI headquarters.It says there are difficulties in facilitating officers because Treasury has delayed in opening an account where the money can be deposited. Please note that this headquarters is currently experiencing difficulties in accomplishing the above subject due to delayance [sic] by the Treasury to secure an account for DCI at the Exchequer from where operational funds for facilitation can be withdrawn from, it says. We will be able to serve you better once the account is availed and operational, the memo signed by Luke Migot says. Facilitation to officers includes allowances for travel out of town.
