Meru Governor Peter Munya has urged voters not to be deceived by his opponents propaganda but to elect the best manager of their resources. He said Senator Kiraitu Murungi s interest in the position is selfish, biased and aimed at bringing disunity.Munya said Kiraitu had a great opportunity to spearhead development in the county, and especially his backyard South Imenti, but he used divide-and-rule and discriminatory tactics to remain in power. The only thing they want is control of the resources in Meru. Not that somebody has better skills. It is about selfish interests, he said. You are the ones to decide who ... won t discriminate? Who will unite residents? I know I have done this and today Meru is united due to my equal distribution of resources and employment. He spoke at Kawamcungu Catholic Church in South Imenti on Thursday.
