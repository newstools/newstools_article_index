The drought in Garissa has not reached alarming levels for the national government intervention, Ijara MP Ibrahim Abass has said. He was responding to Governor Nathif Jama, who declared the drought a disaster and called for national intervention.Abass said it is the county government s duty to mitigate the drought. The county gets Sh7 billion annually but it cannot pay its bills and solve basic problems such as lack of water, he said. It is unfortunate that the governor came to my constituency with no tangible solutions to current situation. Abass spoke in Ijara town on Sunday. He said the food donated by the governor in Masalani subcounty recently was too little. Taking photos with the little relief food purporting to assist drought-affected residents is a public relation exercise taken too far. What the people of Garissa want is service delivery, he said. Urgent responseThe legislator said area leaders have discussed the drought with the Office of the President and they expect a quick response from the national government. He appealed to the international community to intervene before it is too late. It will be useless for the government and NGOs to come into the picture when people and livestock start dying, Abass said. Durring a tour of Masalani, Ijara constituency, on Friday, Nathif urged the national government to urgently intervene and help the residents to prevent loss of lives and property.
