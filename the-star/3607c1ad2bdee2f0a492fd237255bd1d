Kenya Railways engineer Maxwell Mengich on Friday released details of how phase two of the standard gauge railway line from Syokimau in Machakos to Suswa in Kajiado will connect various towns.He said the phase, which runs from Nairobi to Naivasha, will change the face of Kajiado county. Mengich said it will open up Twala, Ongata Rongai, Kiserian, Bulbul and Ngong towns. The route starts from the west end of the Nairobi south hub, where the Mombasa Nairobi SGR ends, turns south-westward, through the Nairobi National Park and then westward, past Twala and Ongata Rongai towns, he said.Mengich, who is attached to the SGR project, made the remarks in Kajiado town after an extensive tour of the intended route, from Syokimau to Ngong. He was accompanied by Governor David Nkedianye.Mengich said the SGR will cross the Magadi Road next to the Adventist University of Africa and Ngong Road at Embulbul urban centre. From there, it will descend into the Rift Valley through a tunnel located northwest of Ngong Hills.From Ngong Hills, the line will proceed northwest to the proposed Industrial Parks at Mai Mahiu and Suswa, then crosses the B3 Road at Duka Moja on the way to Naivasha. Nkedianye said there will be major activities in Twala, Kandisi, Rimpa, Nkoroi, Embulbul near Veterinary Farm and in Kimuka, once the SGR enters Kajiado.He urged the SGR team to engage the public openly to avoid unnecessary squabbles. In Mai Mahiu, a station will be established about 10 kilometres South of the township. There will be another station in Suswa town.Mengich said light SGR passenger trains in Ngong, Twala, Ongata Rongai and Embulbul will ease road traffic jams. There will be a 6km-width, 18m-average-height, single-line bridge in the Nairobi Park.
