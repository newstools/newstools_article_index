Eleven suspects are being held in Juja police station in connection with the theft of laptops and cameras from JKuat students.Juja police boss Patricia Nasio told the Star in her office on Tuesday that they are also looking for a broker who is suspected of colluding with students and bankrolling the young men to steal from the students.She said the broker went into hiding after the suspected thieves were arrested.Nasio said there has been an upsurge of violent robberies targeting Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology students.Students are often injured in the robberies and last month, a second-year student was shot by the thugs when he refused to hand over his laptop. We held a community policing meeting last week in my office between the security officers and the caretakers of the respective hostels and agreed to a working relationship," Nasio said."We are also questioning some students suspected of colluding with armed gangsters to terrorise their colleagues and we are hoping that by the end of the exercise we will have gotten to the bottom of this vice that has led to the loss of more than 20 laptops in the last two months. Nasio said police patrols have been intensified around the university, but it is a challenge maintaining law and order among students, who sometimes fall prey of the thugs due to their own carelessness.Students had earlier threatened to hold protests.They said the route from the highway to the hostels is not lit and the university administration has not repaired the street lights since they stopped working last year.
