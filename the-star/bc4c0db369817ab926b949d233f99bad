Thursday was International No Bra Day to raise awareness of breast cancer. Women were asked to take off their bras and get breast cancer screening. But on Wednesday, a couple of male MCAs in Embu county turned it into a joke. One said all women MCAS should take of their bras and be checked by the male guards. Embu has 33 MCAs, including 11 women.The MCA said the security guards at the assembly should physically check whether women were indeed going bra-less and living up to their commitment to observe the day. Women MCAs were not amused.It started when Runyenjes Central MCA Steve Munene rose in the assembly and urged women MCAs to remove their bras on Thursday. And guards should pat them down, he said.Temporary speaker Ngari Makenge asked women MCAs to respond to Munene, saying he is a man and wished to fight the cancer scourge. Makima MCA Penina Mutua said all women MCAs were in support of the cancer awareness campaign. But Munene interrupted her, saying she could not be trusted because she had not complied with the no-bra call.Munene said every woman MCA who wants to fight breast cancer should first confirm they are not wearing bras.Annoyed, Mutua told Munene to stop being childish and respect women MCAs. I wonder why Munene is so excited about women s breasts? He recently got married and should have had enough of breasts, she said.Health committee chairperson and nominated MCA Agatha Muthoni told Munene he was treating a serious issue with contempt.Kyeni South MCA Salesio Kimaru said residents in his ward had suffered greatly because of breast cancer. He said there is need to deal firmly with non-communicable diseases.Majority leader Andrew Musakwa urged Munene to explain exactly why women were not supposed to wear bras and asked if undergarments could cause cancer.
