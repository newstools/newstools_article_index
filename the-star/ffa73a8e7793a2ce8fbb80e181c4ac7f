Three women s volleyball teams are eyeing the remaining two slots at the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) national league play-offs set for November in Mombasa. The battle for the remaining slots has attracted regulars Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Nairobi Water and Bungoma County.The three sides have crucial fixtures next month during the KVF final league leg in Eldama Ravine, Baringo County to decide the final two teams for the playoffs.Winners here will join champions Kenya Pipeline and league leaders Kenya Prisons who have already booked their slots. The wardresses remain unbeaten from seven round of matches with 21 points while Pipeline are second on log with 18 points from seven matches. Nairobi Water have 13 points from eight matches.The side must win one of the two fixtures to be guaranteed a slot in the play-offs. KCB who are placed fourth with nine points from eight matches face Mt.Kenya University and champions Kenya Pipeline and need to win both matches to sail through. Should KCB lose the two ties, Bungoma, who are fifth with eight points, could likely sneak through as they only need to win their remaining three fixtures.Nairobi Water tactician Joseph Waiganjo said: It s all about mathematics for KCB, Bungoma County and Nairobi Water. But in our case, all we need is a win against Bungoma County.
