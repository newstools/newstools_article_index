They say the only woman who knows where her husband is, is a widow but for the rest you, jua tuu he is only yours when you are with him. But once he steps out, he is government property. The drama between the Chibus seems to have just started after Diamond Platnumz released his new video Maria Salome in which Tanzanian model cum socialite Hamisa Mobbetto is one of the video vixens. Mobetto who has been linked to Diamond can be seen twerking on him, something which seems to have annoyed Zari. Just recently, Zari sent a stern warning to her 'competitors' the likes of Kenyan socialite Huddah Monroe, Hamisa Mobetto, Wema Sapetu, Lynn (WCD's video vixen) among other women who have allegedly slept with her husband or anyone else thirsting for him.Zari mocked her "competitors" claiming that if he doesn't claim you in public, then you don't deserve him. Watu na Bae zetu nyaku nyakus can t even post their own. Told you, if he can t claim you in public, don t give him the good good in private. U know what that means right &amp; I bet u know where that leaves you. Tag your bae and wish him or her a good night. The Ugandan businesswoman and socialite who had relocated to South Africa recently jetted back to Tanzania silently to come and protect her bread and butter after rumours surfaced that Diamond's phone was off for two days. Well, Zari is currently in Tanzanian but it seems all is not well in paradise. She found a pair of earrings believed to be Hamisa Mobetto's in her bedroom and the jealous lady could not 'act maturely' and as usual she took to Snapchat to expose the model. "You can't clean my bedroom nor my bathroom. Do you even clean your P****," Zari posted on Snapchat. Hamisa Mobetto was recently spotted looking cosy with Zari's ex-husband Ivan Semwanga. Who knows what they are upto?
