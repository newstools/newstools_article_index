A driver who allegedly hit and caused the death of a university student as he tried to avoid alcoblow test on the Thika Super highway has lost a bid to block his prosecution.Yesterday, city magistrate Elector Riany said the trial of Job Nyongesa will proceed to full hearing.He is accused of causing the death of 21-year-old Brian Kiambati on January 30.The prosecution says he drove on the wrong side of the road and rammed into another car in which Kiambati was in.The motorist had objected to his trial on grounds the charge sheet was defective. Nyongesa is out on 100,000 bail.His lawyer John Khaminiwa said he had argued the charge sheet presented by the prosecution had used his Christians names, which is unlawful since the state has no religion.Prosecutor Mary Nganga objected, saying it was just a delaying tactics.Nganga had told the court that the charge sheet was proper before the court and it had all the constitutional requirements.
