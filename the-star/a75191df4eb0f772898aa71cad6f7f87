The Leopards of the Democratic Republic of Congo, had only tasted defeat once, against Cameroon, in their last 14 fixtures before meeting Kenya, while Harambee Stars had not seen the end of a 90-minute game leading, away from home, since the beginning of the year.Therefore, walking back to the tunnel at the Stade de Martyrs away in Kinshasa, as winners was no mean achievement.The incredible football successes witnessed in the home of Soukous Music, has made DRC one of my model African football nation - their political and socio-economic challenges at a national level notwithstanding.The DRC is Africa s largest French speaking nation, with a huge population of its over 70 Million people battling life under one of the lowest GDPs on the continent (USD 33.12 Billion).This is an incongruous position for the DRC, because had there been good economic policies, the country would be at par with the continent s economic powerhouses - And not live like a rich poor country they are today.DRC, a former part of King Leopold s larger Belgian-Congo, before an independence struggle that saw Congo Brazzaville and the former Zaire (Now DRC) attain political autonomy, is considered Africa s garden of eden , for its abundance; DRC has an incredible amount of mineral deposits amongst other natural resources than any other nation on the continent.DRC boosts of having one of the most fertile agricultural lands; According to Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the DRC is home to the largest biomes, the equatorial rain forest, which covers close to two thirds of its national territory - but currently threatened by illegal logging activities.In addition, DRC has a huge deposits of: Copper, Cobalt, Coltan, Gold, Diamonds, and crude oil - However, all these are mostly mined at an artisanal level, with most of it being done illegally too.Politically, DRC exists against a background of violent political unrest and widespread corruption, with dozens of armed groups already sitting on parts of President Joseph Kabila s country fighting for a share of its control. It s alleged that most of the rebel groups enjoy support from foreign governments with mining interests in the country.In consequence, the worst affected are the helpless civilians who are exposed to never ending wars, diseases, malnutrition, and effects of the artisanal mining in the careless discharge of cyanide, and mercury into the environment.A report on DRC s political situation published by the BBC (February 2016), The Democratic Republic of Congo s life expectancy stands at 47 years for men and 51 years for women respectively, hence if you manage to land in Kinshasa when TP Mazembe is locking horns with AS VITA Club, you might want to attribute the life in this population to their love for the game of football.The rise of TP Mazembe is a testimony or a clear revelation of what organisation can do, for as long as there s a strong will to change how things are done.The Lubumbashi based side are the current African Club champions, an accolade they have won on four other occasions (1967, 1968, 2009, 2010 and 2015).Mazembe, are also two times CAF Super cup winners, as well as the first of the only two African clubs to have bagged a silver medal at the FIFA Club World Cup (2010).The topflight league in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been a subject of continental headline news for years, they have produced sterling results, with their teams such as; TP Mazembe, CS Don Bosco, DC Motema Pembe, FC St. Eloi Lupopo, and AS Vita Club.The country s robust league, has inspired good performances at the national team level too.DRC have been to the world cup once (1974), and won the Africa Cup of Nations twice (1968 and 1974). In the 2015 edition held in Equatorial Guinea, they missed the final by whisker, but beat the hosts in the third place play-offs to bag the bronze medal.In February 2016, the DRC successfully defended its African nations cup (CHAN) title, a tournament for local based players, under the tutelage of a native coach Florent Ibeng (formerly of AS Vita Club), a revelation that the country is not only making remarkable strides on the pitch, but in the dugout as well.Back in Kenya, the victory is coming against a background of despair from the local fan, Kenyan football, in general, has gone through trying moments characterised by incessant leadership wrangles that have earned the country two FIFA bans hence slowing down the national team s growth; Kenya has never been to the world cup since the game s introduction, and only managed one AFCON qualification in the last 12 years.Despite inheriting a debt-riddled federation in March 2016, the current Football Kenya Federation (FKF) office, led by president Nick Mwendwa, has embarked on a journey to restore what was once the country s most followed and supported sport by Kenyans and the corporate world back to its glory days.Barely one year into office, Wendwa s team has managed to; put in place a working secretariat, and a functional base commensurate to its reputation as the custodian of association football football in the country, ease the earlier tension between them and KPL to allow for the smooth handling of the national team programs, invested quite some time and resources in the women and youth development programs, and lastly but most importantly, the FKF must be lauded for mending its relationship with the government of Kenya - unlike their predecessors.Kenya s triumph in DRC, a football territory that's today considered one of the most difficult hunting grounds, both for country and club football therefore, is a sign that with continued emphasis on the vital areas of growth, investor confidence is nigh.
