More than 1000 residents of Mikululo in Kibwezi West, Makueni county were left homeless after Kenya Wildlife Service and police officers allegedly torched their homes on Friday.The group was evicted them from a 24,000-acre disputed piece of land that they have been occupying since 1954.The residents' chairman Willy Ndulu said the KWS personnel and APs raided the area at dawn in a helicopter and torched more than 400 homes in Mikukulo Ranching Cooperative Society. Ndulu said the officers also destroyed food stores, further claiming that the security personnel used a chopper belonging to a developer claiming the land. He said the developer has already started fencing off the land and wants them out."We think they want to ensure we don't come back after a case in court on the property is concluded," Ndulu said, adding that the security personnel also torched Bondeni Primary school in the ranch.Ndulu said the school has more than 100 pupils and had been listed as a polling centre by IEBC.The homeless residents have camped at the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. Ndulu said the security officers are also telling them to leave the KALRO land, which is at the at the border of Makueni and Kajiando counties."The officers brutally beat and robbed residents of money and took some animals," Ndulu said.Ndulu said they had moved to court after they learned the KWS had obtained a tittle deed for the land and allocated six acres of it to a conservationist. "We don't know of any conservancy in Makueni county. We know national parks don't have tittle deeds. They only have gazetted boundary plans," he said."When we learnt that they had obtained a tittle deed, we went to court to challenge the validity of the same and got orders restraining the KWS or anyone from interfering with our stay in the said parcel," Ndulu said."No proper notice was given and KWS acted against a court order. We demand that KWS follows the law," the residents' chair added.Makueni governor Kivutha Kibwana visited the area and condemned the act, further promising the affected that the matter will be looked into.Read: Mavoko squatters plea to Uhuru: Resettle us during your visit to Ukambani
