Reason? He is said to have been turned, as they say in the spy movies. He was recently seen heading towards the office of a senior Jubilee politician in Parliament, where a deal was reportedly struck before he walked out a happy man, grinning from ear to ear. Corridors has been informed he will be among a number of MPs in the opposition receiving a stipend with the intention of silencing criticism.

The MP, who is fond of bullying and intimidating heads of government institutions for tenders, fronted two companies and, despite quoting stratospherically, was awarded the tender through political pressure. The CEO of the state corporation in the energy sector reportedly received a call two weeks ago from the MP, asking him to make payments in full, even before delivering the contract as required by the law.**********A Jubilee hopeful for Nairobi Governor was surprised on Thursday after Eastleigh residents refused to listen to him. The politician had accompanied Deputy President William Ruto to the area on official business, but when he was called to speak a section of the crowd flatly refused to hear him.

He is now planning to counter this wave of discontent from the Somali community. The MP has in the recent past also irked some Jubilee top guns for his insistence on playing the Kikuyu card, saying Nairobi should be reclaimed by Jubilee to protect the interests of Central Kenya businesses.*********
