Muhoroni MP Onyango K Oyoo has accused some national government officials of colluding with a miller in Kisumu to import illegal sugar.He said the request by a miller in Muhoroni to import raw sugar from neighbouring countries will open the way for illicit sugar. K Oyoo said the Jubilee officials have been paid a lot of money to approve the sugar imports.He said if the proposed importation is not stopped he will name those involved. K Oyoo accused the officers of colluding with the importers to kill the local industry.He said the sugar industry is the source of livelihood for millions of Kenyans, adding that allowing a miller to import raw sugar will cause an illegal glut. Let them compromise everybody but I want to tell them they will not pocket me. Over my dead body shall I allow my constituents to suffer at the hands of a few greedy people, K Oyoo said.He said the government should focus on how best local sugar industries can be more vibrant to attract potential investors.The MP urged the government to employ stringent measures to stop cheap sugar imports, instead of allowing powerful people to ruin the lives of millions of citizens. The government needs to ensure all imported sugar is taxed to level the playing field or risk the collapse of the sugar industry, K Oyoo said.
