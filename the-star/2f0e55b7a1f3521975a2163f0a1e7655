Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya has said he deserves a second term in office and his development record will help him get reelected. As the first governors since the inception of devolution, we have spent the last three years putting in place structures for devolution and it s only fair that we are reelected to now deliver services to the people, he said.Oparanya spoke on Wednesday at his office during the swearing in of eight members of the county administrative boundaries committee. The committee will conduct public hearings and propose the number of villages and community units to be created. We want to do it differently from the national government, which looks at the provincial administration as only a security [organ]. The community units will deal with all departments at that level, Oparanya said.Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya yesterday defended governors, saying they are judged harshly on their development records compared to the national government. Oparanya told his opponents to prepare for a tough battle. They include Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, businesswoman Mable Muruli and former Medical Services minister Amukowa Anangwe.
