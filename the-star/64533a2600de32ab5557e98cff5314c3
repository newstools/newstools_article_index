There are sound reasons why any country would want to host a major international event.Chief of these is a major tourism boost, through a massive inflow of cash as those attending the conference will always have plenty of money to spend.But even more important is that the mere fact of getting all these foreigners to come over to your country, is a sign that your country is taken seriously; that you have global significance; that you are considered worthy of this rare honour.And this applies as much to the Olympics recently held in Brazil, as to the TICAD Conference - the signature economic conference supported by the government of Japan - currently being held in Kenya.TICAD stands for the Tokyo International Conference on African Development - and it has previously been always held in Japan. Now for the first time TICAD is actually being held in Africa for the first time. And it is a singular honour to Kenya, that Nairobi was chosen to host this conference.
