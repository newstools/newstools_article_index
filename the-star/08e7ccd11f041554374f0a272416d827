The Power of Mercy Advisory Committee should be decentralised to give residents a say in reintegrating reformed ex-convicts into society, says an official. In most cases, society refuses to accept [former] capital offenders because it feels they still are a threat. The committees recommending his or her release will follow up and ensure the community accepts them and assists in the integration, David Matolo said.He is the vice chairman of the Interfaith Peace Committee. Matolo made his presentation yesterday to the committee in Garissa town. He said his committee should play a central role in reintegrating ex-convicts into society.Quoting the Bible, Pastor Joseph Mwasia opposed the death sentence, saying the sanctity of life must be upheld by society and the state. He said only God can take away life.But Maalim Abdulahi Abdi, making reference to the Koran, said in as much as the constitution overrides religion, there is need to apply religion where appropriate. He said Islam calls for an eye for eye , therefore, whoever takes another person s life should lose his.The majority of those who presented their views felt that rape, which is common in remote areas, should be a capital offence and attract the maximum penalty. But vice chairperson Regina Boisabi asked why women did not make recommendations on rape sentencing.On the request that rape cases be settled out of court, Boisabi said because of the pain and trauma victims go through, it is only fair that the due process of the law is followed for a fair judgment.
