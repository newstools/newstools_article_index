Most of our our players played at the Safari Sevens a fortnight ago. They also played in the national Sevens circuit and we are confident enough we can go all the way and win the tournament, Adil added.Adil said it gives some players a chance to fine tune their skills ahead of the Kenya Sevens training period and World Sevens Series which start in December.The Zambian national Sevens team and Egypt-based Alexandria RFC have also confirmed participation in the two day tournament.The trio will be competing with other Nigerian club sides in the annual rugby event staged to commemorate Nigeria s Independence anniversary.The 2016 edition promises to be bigger and better with thirteen local teams and 3 international teams battle ready for this year s trophy.Elsewhere KCB flyhalf Ken Andola will miss the club's semifinal showdown against Nakuru on Saturday in the Impala floodlight semifinals.Andola had a partial tear on the bicep joining the shoulder and will have to sit out the next fortnight. Andola got injured in the 28-19 quarterfinal win against Homeboyz last weekend. This has forced a reshuffle of the backline with fullback Darwin Mukidza coming in at flyhalf.Coach Curtis Olago expects him to be fit for the start of the Kenya Cup league later in the month. We have built depth in our team and the next guy in line will take his place. We hope Andola is fit and ready for the start of the league, added Olago . Andola is expected to be replaced by Billy Isabwa in the 10 jersey.
