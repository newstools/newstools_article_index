Did embattled ODM secretary general Ababu Namwamba fear that the dreaded Men In Black would rough him up when he attended a Central Management Committee meeting on Wednesday? The firebrand Budalang i MP arrived at Orange House, venue of the crucial meeting chaired by party leader Raila Odinga, accompanied by a team of armed bodyguards and well-built Funyula MP Paul Otuoma by his side. The hawk-eyed bodyguards closely monitored every move anywhere near Ababu, even such innocent things as scratching your head or removing a handkerchief from your pocket. Ababu also arrived and left in Otuoma s car, following rumours that what happened to former party CEO Magerer Lang at would befall him. Magerer was manhandled mercilessly.*********Talk of the Uhuru Kenyatta Succession in Central Kenya is triggering interesting conversations among politicians from the region. A group of politicians were on Wednesday evening heard laughing off the idea that Kiambu Governor William Kabogo can be the next regional kingpin after President Kenyatta. The politicians were heard saying that Kabogo has a limited profile that does not go past the Kiambu borders and he had a particularly long shot at succeeding Uhuru. One of them even said that Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has a more popular profile in Kiambu and beyond than the Governor. Kabogo may not even win his seat again, but thinks he can appeal to the rest of Central Kenya. Can he get even 10 votes in Nyeri or Nyandarua? one politician said, as his two friends, an MP from Nyeri and a former MP from Murang a, laughed until their sides ached.********Are politicians from Gusii shaken by the seemingly rising star of Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang i? We are told some politicians are threatened by the eloquent minister s activities in the region, which solidly voted for Cord at the last election. We are told that some of the politicians could be orchestrating the burning of schools on the minister s home turf to send him a message. Matiang i has held harambees in two of the three schools that have been set on fire and it is reported politicians from the area who believe the CS is using his post to position himself as the next Kisii kingpin are sabotaging his efforts. But the powerful CS is stopping at nothing to stay the course.********So Mogotio MP Hellen Sambili was consulted over her appointment to the IEBC negotiating team by Cord? Sources whisper to Corridors that Sambili s decision to publicly denounce the offer has not gone down well with the Kanu honchos. It s said the former East African Cooperation Minister declined the offer to avoid a political backlash from the electorate. It remains unclear why another Kanu lawmaker - including Kanu chairman Gideon Moi - could not take over the job.*******A senior official at City Hall demanded Sh100 million to facilitate the passage of the county s budget. It is understood that the man made it clear that unless he received the cash the budget would not pass. Indeed, when the assembly time came yesterday, the session was adjourned for lack of quorum. The budget will now be tabled next Tuesday.
