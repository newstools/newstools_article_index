Transport in parts of Eastlands, the area stretching between Buruburu and Bahati, has been interrupted after a PSV Sacco grounded its operations following leadership wrangles. Officials, Matatu owners and employees of the C-BET Sacco went berserk on Saturday and parked their vehicles outside Buruburu police divisional headquarters in protest of alleged frustration by an ousted official. Vice chairman Wandore Chege said the Sacco withdrew 23 PSVs that ply the Buruburu-Bahati-Town route due to frustrations by ousted chairman Henry Mathembo.Read: Matatu strike starts today over police harassmentThe Sacco has 34 vehicles with a staff of over 150 employees. He sent a message to employees including route managers to return sacco uniforms, badges and radio calls. He also plucked off TLB (Transport Licensing Board) stickers from the new chairman's minibus, Chege told the Star at the police station. Chege said Mathembo forged Minutes of a meeting where he (Mathembo) was allegedly elected and used them to obtain court orders on Friday to remain in office. He accused Mathembo of declining to vacate office after he was voted out in July after members of the sacco accused him of frustrating them. We are fearing that goons could take over our stage in town, Chege said. Mathembo could not be reached as his phone was switched off. A senior police officer at the station who is not allowed to speak to the media told the Star that the directorate of criminal investigations is probing the matter.Also read; Matatus pledge strike today over city centre parking ban
