The political fate of former MP Peris Simam (pictured) could be sealed after she was convicted of corruption last week. Simam, who had declared she would vie for Uasin Gishu senator, and her husband Enock Kimeli will appear in court today for the ruling of their bond application. They were detained on Friday when they failed to pay a Sh10 million fine. The two, alongside Shachile Laban, Maluti Maluti, John Khaemba and Wisdon Maina were were found guilty of corruption by an Eldoret court. They were convicted on 10 counts of corruption. The six will each be jailed 18 years if they do not pay the fines ranging between Sh700,000 to Sh5 million for eachof the counts. Under the law, anyone sentenced to a jail term exceeding six months either at the time of registration as a candidate or election will be disqualified from vying.Those found to have contravened Chapter Six, misused or abused state/public office cannot vie. The six were charged with economic crimes and abuse of office when Simam was MP between 2007 and 2013. We will definitely appeal the ruling next week, lawyer Michael Chemwok said. The lawyers will seek to overturn the conviction at the High Court.Simam was accused of influencing the award of a tender to her company, Kachur Holdings, for construction of the Bayete-Chuiyat-Bargeiywa road. More than Sh4.5 million was illegally paid to the firm, yet the road was not repaired.
