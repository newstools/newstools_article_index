Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero may have endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta during introductions at the opening of the Nairobi ASK show on Wednesday.Kidero said: "Let me just thank you for always honouring us from 2013, you were here ... this year, we're together and we are definite and confident that you will be with us in 2017."Uhuru responded: "And I look forward ... nikijaliwa na mwenyezi Mungu na maombi ya Kidero nirudi 2017. Asante sana."Kidero's remarks drew various reactions from Kenyans on Twitter.One user said: "Governor Kidero expresses confidence that President Uhuru Kenyatta will win 2017 election ...""Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero expresses confidence that President Uhuru Kenyatta will defeat Raila Odinga," another person tweeted.Another person posted: "Kidero denies endorsing Pres Uhuru.... But the heart wants what the heart wants."But Kidero tweeted: "Just to be clear, I was inviting H.E Uhuru Kenyatta to next year's Nairobi Intl. Trade Fair since he's a fairly successful dairy farmer."The ODM Governor denied making the remark as an endorsement of Uhuru's 2017 bid for the presidency.Shortly after the opening speeches, Uhuru and Kidero were seen sharing a ride in the President's ceremonial C in C armoured vehicle.This also elicited mixed responses, but it has been clarified that the President has discretion on who can share the vehicle with him.[VIDEO] Sonko supporters happy with 'Uhuru's endorsement' for Nairobi governor seat
