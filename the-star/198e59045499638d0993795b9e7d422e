Kenya wants a total ban on the sale of elephant ivory.Environment CS Judi Wakhungu yesterday said the push for the ban is aimed at saving Africa s embattled elephant and rhino populations. The future of the African elephant and rhino is far from secure as long as demand for their products exists, Wakhugu said on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. Any sale, however legal, increases risks to the animals, she said. Wakhungu will lead the Kenyan delegation to the meeting on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which has began in South Africa.She said elephant poaching has declined since the government started taking touh action on those involved.In Kenya, 93 elephants were killed in 2015, down from 384 in 2012. On climate change, Wakhungu said 60 countries have ratified the Paris Agreement, which seeks to lower the rate of global emissions and adapt new ways of countering the effects of climate change. The Cabinet Secretary said even though Kenya is yet to ratify the agreement, the country is working to ensure it has joined the 60 members by the end of next month. In October we will hold a follow-up meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, Wakhungu said.Apart from putting together the Climate Change Act, the Cabinet Secretary said the government is waiting for the President to announce the formation of the Climate Change Council. We are awaiting the formalisation of the council, which has to go through Cabinet approval and Parliament before the President makes the appointments, she said.From 1.2 million in the 1970s, the number of elephants in Africa has plunged to around 400,000. Poaching for ivory killed 30,000 a year from 2010 to 2012.The future for rhinos, now numbering less than 30,000, is even bleaker, unless poaching is checked.In May, Kenya set on fire105 tonnes of ivory to show its commitment to saving the diminishing elephant population.CITES approved a ban on commercial trade in African elephant ivory in 1989, but since then has permitted one-off sales.
