Tanzanian diva and singer Ray C went through the hardest time of her life as she was getting over her addiction to drugs.Ray C was definitely the most talked about musician in 2014 and last year after she came out to confess that drugs ruined her life and music career, but is now on the path to recovery.The singer's real name Rehema Chelamila was introduced to drugs by her ex-boyfriend and rapper Lord Eyes, who later dumped her, leaving her desperate and broke.Back in 2015, Ray C worked on losing weight that she had gained when battling drug addiction. She seems determined to make a musical comeback and give her fans some new music.Back in June, an emotional video of Ray C emerged online, showing her attempting to commit suicide using a knife but thankfully police rescued her on time and the singer was arrested.Though she has not managed to get back on the music scene, Ray C is still hopeful and has turned to God and love to help with her healing journey as she undergoes therapy.Well, Ray C shocked many of her fans when she went to her social media to reveal her undying love for Nigerian artiste Wizkid, real name, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, and how much she can't stop listening to his music.On the same note, she shockingly revealed that the Ojuelegba hitmaker has blocked her on Instagram, and doesn't understand why Wizkid would do that since they have never met.Well, I hope that she tried to follow the official Instagram account which has been verified, otherwise, why would Wizkid block her?
