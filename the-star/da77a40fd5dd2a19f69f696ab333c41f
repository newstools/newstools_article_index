Cord leader Raila Odinga has been reduced to a trade unionist, as he is always outside the government, a Mombasa Jubilee politician has said. Khamis, alias Baba Ngida, said Raila cannot in his wildest dreams become President. A trade union is never part of the government. It is always opposing every move or what it terms oppressive government policies, he said.Khamis spoke on Saturday at the launch of the Coast Jubilee Movement at Star of the Sea Secondary School. The group will carry out voter and ID registration.
