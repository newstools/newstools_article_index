ICC member countries should address the obstruction by Kenya in the case against President Uhuru Kenyatta, Human Rights Watch has said.Trial Chamber V(B) said it found Kenya failed to comply with its obligations by not providing information related to the President.HRW said: The countries should make sure the message is heard in Nairobi, that they will not turn a blind eye to the government s obstruction of justice."Elizabeth Evenson, who is International Justice Program associate director, further said nations should take Kenya s obstruction seriously "as they should whenever the court s judges find a state party has breached its obligations to the court . Defaulting on legal obligations to the ICC should not be allowed to go unchecked, Evenson said in a statement on Tuesday.The director urged the Assembly of States Parties to ensure a consistent and effective approach to findings of non-cooperation."This will bring about the cooperation by ICC member countries that the court needs to deliver justice," she said.Evenson said the government's failure to provide records sought by the prosecution occurred against a backdrop of hostile rhetoric against the ICC proceedings."The Kenyan government made repeated efforts to use the annual meeting of the Assembly of States Parties to politicise the court s proceedings," she said.She added that the Uhuru administration initiated an aggressive diplomatic campaign to lobby leaders to support ending the ICC s cases and undermine Africa support for the court.Read: Move to pull out of ICC still on course as court has lost focus This comes hours after Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen dismissed the ICC ruling as inconsequential.
