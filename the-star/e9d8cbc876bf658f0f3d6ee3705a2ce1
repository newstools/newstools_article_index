The Tharaka Nithi government will build a Sh30 million sewage treatment plant in Chuka town.Governor Samuel Ragwa said, There is no need to build a septic tank now. Residents just need to be connected to a piping system. This will help Chuka University get rid of its waste. He spoke on Thursday when inspecting a completed Sh8 million sewage treatment plant with European donors.Swedish Ambassador Johan Borgstam and Finland s envoy were present. The Sh30 million plant will be supervised by the Nithi Water and Sanitation Company. Ragwa said the plant will be equipped to transform waste into fertiliser than can be used for farming. Tharaka Nithi is the only county without a sewerage system. That s why we are working tirelessly to have the work start, he said. We have already bought land for the construction of the facility and soon works will commence, Ragwa said.
