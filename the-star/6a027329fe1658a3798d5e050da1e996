The Kenya Cancer Association will hold its third Relay for Life event on October 15 at the Nyayo National Stadium. Speaking during the launch of the event, executive director Deborah Modi said the 24-hour event aims at urging Kenyans to go for early screening. The walk basically signifies that cancer never sleeps, she said. In Kenya, 24,000 people die annually from cancer. The most common cancers in women are breast and cervical cancers while in men it is prostate cancer.
