Opec member Nigeria expects its oil production rate to jump by 22 percent by the year-end to 2.2 million barrels per day from current levels, its oil minister said yesterday. He said he hopes a force majeure on all its oil fields would be lifted by December or January. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, on a visit to New Delhi, also said Nigeria was likely to sign a cash-raising oil deal with India for $15 billion by the end of this year. India's oil ministry said that Nigeria, whose economy has been hit hard by low oil prices and militancy, had requested an upfront payment."Nigeria has a bit of a cash flow problem right now. Our reserves are not as strong as we want them," Kachikwu told reporters yesterday. "The impact of that is the value of the naira (currency) is coming down. So what we are trying is to leverage on the assets we have to receive immediate cash."
