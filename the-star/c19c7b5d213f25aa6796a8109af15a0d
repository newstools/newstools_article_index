AFC Leopards stand-in coach Ezekiel Akwana reveals they have given up on the SportPesa Premier League title and are now working hard to avoid relegation. Ingwe have completely accepted their failure to chase for the league title and decided to work hard with the aim of surviving relegation he said.The 13-time league champions started the title campaign on a high note but things gradually changed and are now within the vicinity of the drop zone with only five matches to go. Akwana is worried about the situation but his biggest prayer is to see the mighty club stay in the country s top league. Things are not very good for us now. There are a lot of frustrations. It is affecting both the fans and the players. We need to come up with not less than 15 points in the remaining five games so that we can be sure about remaining in the top flight. There is no shortcut. We have to work very hard and I think the players know it. My wish is that we win the next five matches because that is the only way we can guarantee our safety, he told the league s official portal.His love for the club and the history of the club make him think that something is not right going by the 2016 performance. He has always believed AFC Leopards had never had to fight for league survival. It is sad though that for such a great club as AFC Leopards, instead of thinking about winning the league, we are thinking about finishing above the relegation zone. That is how low the club has fallen. This should not happen to this great club, if you know and understand its history. The players need to really work hard.
