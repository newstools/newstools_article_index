Over-the-internet smartphone messaging application WhatsApp s new privacy policy has come into effect, with many users unsure of how the information sharing will affect their private data. The policy announced in August allows WhatsApp to share account information of its more than one billion users with parent firm Facebook and other social apps such as Instagram, Atlas, Onavo, Parse, Moves, Oculus, LiveRail and Masquerade."WhatsApp account information is shared with Facebook to improve your Facebook ads and products experiences," states part of the new terms of use, which users were to agree to by Sunday.Following the announcement of this new update, however, chainmail surfaced on the application asking users not to allow sharing of their account information with Facebook.The variety of messages have warned of dire consequences should any user not restrict sharing of their information.The panic is, however, ill-informed according to the company and tech experts, as the info sharing rights WhatsApp is seeking are for purposes of customising ads that appear on a user s Facebook stream.WhatsApp has access to a user s phone number, email address, name, and location.With the use of the app, globally ranked as the most used ahead of Facebook, other information collected include a user s profile photo, status messages, and contact details.The contact details are collected cumulatively from all users on the platform, and are not sourced from just one user. This means anyone who has downloaded the app and used it, by default provides information on other users in their contacts list.WhatsApp collects usage and log information, device and connection information, and cookies which are used to enhance user experience on WhatsApp Web and its desktop variant.Account information availed through the use of third party services such as sharing of website links via WhatsApp, will also be collected.WhatsApp, however, does not have access to chat messages including photos, audios, videos, documents, map locations and contacts sent as chats because they are encrypted. Your messages are yours and we can t read them, the policy reads. We ve built privacy, end-to-end encryption, and other security features into WhatsApp. Under the WhatsApp terms, chats are deleted from the service's servers once delivered, with undelivered ones being stored for a maximum 30 days. Only viral content being shared in high frequency stay on the firm's servers longer.Prior to the change in privacy policy, none of the information WhatsApp has access to was publicly displayed or shared with family apps.However, 30 days from now, users can still opt not to share their information with Facebook after which the option will no longer exist.An Indian High Court on Sunday, however, directed WhatsApp to delete all prior account information for all users till September 25, when the new policy took effect according to indianexpress.com.In the ruling viewed as a landmark declaration of a court on online privacy, the judges further asked WhatsApp to delete account information even for users who opt to retain the use of the app.The suit was filed by Imperial College, London student Karmanya Singh Sareen, and Amity Law College student Shreya Sethi who argued that the new terms severely compromises the rights of its users and makes the privacy rights of users completely vulnerable .The change in policy is, however, in line with Facebook s advertising business model. This has seen Facebook s stock value continue to increase, aided by strong earnings and success in its mobile advertising business, which grew by 22 per cent this year, according to Forbes.com.
