A court on Thursday unconditionally released three suspects linked to the foiled September 11 Mombasa Central Police station 'attack'.The girls were said to have been in contact with the three women who were shot dead allegedly attempting to raid the station. Luul Ali and her sister Nasteho Ali alongside Zamzam Abdalla - classmates of the suspected attack mastermind Tasnim Yakub, were released after the prosecution failed to give compelling reasons on why they should be detained for more days.The court declined to grant police seven days to investigate them for links to the police station attack.Principal magistrate Henry Nyakweba said the police failed to link the girls with any terror group - namely ISIS or al Shabaab.Through an affidavit, the police had stated that they belong to a certain terror group but failed to mention the specific one they were referring to.Watch: [VIDEO] Cops accused of killing three 'innocent' girls at Mombasa Central police stationNyakweba also said the girls were not linked to the police attack since it was only a WhatsApp group that linked them.State counsel Erick Masila said he was going to appeal against the decision by the court.Seven people including slain Muslim cleric Aboud Rogo's wife Haniya Saggar are being investigated over the attack.Read: Three women arraigned over Mombasa terror attack
