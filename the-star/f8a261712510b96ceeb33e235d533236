The driver of an Ongata Line Sacco matatu involved in an accident on Lang ata Road has been released on Sh1 million bond. The bond will be applicable in 14 days to give police time to complete investigations.This will include statements from witnesses and filling of P3 forms by victims. This came after calls by the prosecutor to deny Francis Mukuria bond, citing that he is at risk of being lynched. Four people died in the accident. Magistrate Barbara Ojoo on Tuesday ordered the bond terms be granted to the accused, saying despite the public protests, Mukuria has a right to bond.The transport authority has deregistered the Ongata Line Company following the accident. Director general Francis Meja said on Monday passengers are not allowed to board any vehicle belonging to the sacco as they will be impounded if found operating contrary to the directive.
