Four years later, the government is yet to table this report for debate. I am challenging Jubilee to tell Kenyans why it is sitting on this report. Kenyans want to close this dark chapter in their history and move on to other things," Raila said.Joho urged residents of the Coast region to be firm and remain focused in ODM even after most of the political leaders in the region defected to Jubilee party."We are aware that these cheap leaders who defected to Jubilee party were all given brown envelopes that is why they decided to betray the party," Joho said. "If Jubilee party has brown envelops then I have principles and anyone who has principles is priceless," Kingi said.Read: Respect me when you come to Kwale, Mvurya tells Raila
