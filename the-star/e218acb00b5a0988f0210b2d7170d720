The banking industry posted a marginal 2.94 per cent growth in profit before tax to Sh38.4 billion in the first quarter of the year, slowed by rising bad debt.The industry which posted Sh37.3 billion during the same period a year ago was, however, 51.5 per cent better than Sh25.5 billion in fourth quarter 2015, fresh data by the Central Bank shows. The (quarter-on-quarter) growth in profitability is mainly attributable to a higher decrease in total expenses by 8.5 per cent as compared to a decrease in total income of 2.7 per cent in the quarter ended March 2016, the CBK said in quarterly economic review. As a result of increased profitability, the return on assets increased from 2.9 per cent in December 2015 to 3.4 per cent in March while return on shareholders funds also increased from 23.8 per cent in December 2015 to 27.7 per cent in March. Gross non-performing loans in three months to March rose 15.8 per cent to Sh170.6 billion from Sh147.3 billion in December. This was an equivalent of 7.86 per cent of the Sh2.22 trillion in gross loans advanced by the 43-bank industry a rise from 6.80 per cent of Sh2.17 trillion gross loans last December. Bad debt grew highest in real estate sector at 42.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter to Sh19.78 billion due to a slowdown in demand for finished units, the CBK said.The default rate in personal loans increased by 21.5 per cent to Sh50.62 billion as a result of negative macroeconomic drivers such as job losses and delayed salaries . Banks, however, cut loans to households the highest sector by loan volumes by Sh20.4 billion to Sh553.1 billion in March from Sh573.5 billion in December. The manufacturing sector posted a 15.5 per cent rise to Sh19.85 billion in what the CBK attributed to cash flow challenges by companies due to a slowdown in business conditions. NPLs in the recovering tourism and hospitality sector, a sector which has in the recent years been battered by terrorist threats grew by a slower 5.04 per cent to Sh2.69 billion. Transport and communication sector, however, posted the highest drop in bad debt at 31.1 per cent to Sh17.98 billion. This was occasioned by enhancement of road safety rules, which has ensured continued business by transporters hence continued repayment of loans, the CBK said. The transport infrastructure has also been improved to the benefit of transporters. The NPLs in agriculture and, mining and quarrying sectors also decreased by 10.78 and 6.22 per cent, respectively, to Sh7.53 billion and Sh2.17 billion. Meanwhile, about 53.2 per cent of the country s wealth was held in public and publicly guaranteed debt in March, fresh data by the Central Bank indicates, from 49.9 per cent in the same period last year. Public debt rose by 23.51 per cent to Sh3.31 trillion from Sh2.68 trillion in March 2015, underlining the government s rising reliance on domestic and external borrowing to meet its expanding budgetary demands. Foreign debt stood at Sh1.67 trillion, an equivalent to 50.3 per cent of the gross domestic product while domestic one was captured at Sh1.65 trillion or 49.7 per cent of the GDP.
