We cannot do anything."Their neighbour Jane Cheplak said they have been camping at Kimeli s home since they received information on his disappearance. Cheplak called on leaders to help the village in finding the missing soldier. Kimeli was the hope of our village. We have been fasting and praying. We do not sleep, she said.Cheplak directed her appeal to Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos and Senator Kipchumba Murkomen."Help us find our missing boy or his body if he is no more, she said, noting they believed Kimeli, who was single, would bring change to their village.Village elder Wilson Limo said efforts to get information from police have been unsuccessful. We have contacted senior police officers through our chiefs, but they tell us to wait as the search continues, Limo said. He appealed to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet for help.The officers were reported missing after the militants raided the police post in Dadaab subcounty, 10km from the Kenya-Somalia border.A source who spoke to the Star on the phone said the militants injured three officers, one of them critically.More on this: 4 cops missing after Shabaab storms campAlso read: Security officials promise report on Hamey raid
