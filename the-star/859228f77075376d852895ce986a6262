Whatever both the Senate and Parliament think about it, and regardless of whether they eventually concur, the party hopping rule should be supported.Its net effect would be to reduce the number of parties over a period of time. This would also help end the political culture of rigged nominations, which all too often result in party disintegration and lack of structure.The fewer parties there are, the more the likelihood of raising the quality of candidate, debate and legislation and the strength of the voter base.The independent candidate option should also remain wide open. But for it to have meaning and promote democracy, the political parties must ensure they conduct free and fair nominations. The culture of dishing out nomination certificates to political friends and financiers only builds up enormous reservoirs of resentment and weakens even the biggest political formations, both incumbent and opposition.In principle, the party-hopping rule keeps the democratic options open.
