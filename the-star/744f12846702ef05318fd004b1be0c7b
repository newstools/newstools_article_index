Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has criticised President Uhuru Kenyatta for telling off the opposition chief in Narok on Wednesday.Speaking at the funeral of William ole Ntimama, Raila Odinga said the former Cabinet minister died while still in ODM. He called after visiting State House and told me he is still in ODM, Raila said.However, Uhuru responded by saying, Kumeza mate si kula nyama. Sasa nyinyi endeleeni kumezea mate, sisi tutaendelea kula nyama. ( Salivating does not mean you have eaten meat. Continue swallowing saliva as we eat meat. )The public discord was so dramatic that Raila refused to stand as the President walked back to his seat. Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka appeared to urge him to rise.Uhuru told Raila to keep his house in order and stop meddling with Jubilee.On Thursday, Joho told Uhuru that the opposition will not relent until it tastes the meat . He spoke at the opening of the seven-a-side football pitch at Mombasa Primary School in Kizingo.Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir said the opposition will clinch the presidency. Our intent is to remove that piece of meat from your mouth. We will not relent until we get that share, he said.Nassir said it is unfair that when Coast leaders speak their mind, they are branded tribal. When we speak, we are accused of tribalism, while the presidency propagates tribalism to the grassroots, he said.Nassir and Joho said they will not be coerced to support Jubilee. There is no place in the constitution that talks about bootlicking. We have a right to enjoy development without supporting the national government, Nassir said. Joho added: There are deliberate efforts from Jubilee to ensure Coast is poor.
