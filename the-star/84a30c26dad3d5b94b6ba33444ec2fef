Most consumers in Kenya use their mobile phones to pay for goods and services due to prevalence of mobile money transfer services, according to a report by MasterCard. The report Impact Innovation states that nearly 90 per cent of consumers in Kenya use mobiles more than any other device for payments.The study, launched at the 2016 MasterCard Innovation Forum in Budapest, surveyed 23,000 consumers in 23 countries in Europe, Africa and the Middle East about their attitude to digital technology. Our study confirms that not only is there a huge appetite for new ways to pay, but consumers overwhelmingly want to use their mobile phones," MasterCard president for Middle East and Africa, Daniel Monehin said.
