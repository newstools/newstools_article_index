EACC detectives arrested a Kajiado county inspectorate official on Saturday while receiving Sh15,000 from a driver who had been arrested for ferrying illegal goods.Enock Muthomi, attached to Kajiado East sub county administrator s office, was caught at his Kitengela officer by the anti-graft police who had tricked him into receiving the money.The driver is said to have reported the matter to his boss in Nairobi and asked for the cash to be given to the inspectorate official before releasing the said goods.On receiving the information, the driver's boss informed the EACC office of the incident and the man was summoned to accompany the officers to Kitengela.The county askari was elated after he was informed the money was ready and thereby led the driver to the store where the goods had been locked.While this was going on, the EACC officers stalked them from behind and grabbed the askari before he could pocket the money. Drama would later ensue.The inspectorate official asked to be allowed to go for a short call but as the EACC officers were putting him on handcuffs, he started peeing on his trousers.This comes one day after EACC officers arrested two traffic cops while soliciting money near Kajiado town on the Athi River/Namanga highway. The officers recovered Sh30, 000 on the three suspects, among them was a county askari.In the Kajiado incident, EACC officers had received several complaints from motorists of police and inspectorate who were notorious for demanding bribes by force.The motorists complained that the officials always threatened them with arrest if they do not part with Sh200 as protection money.Matatu owners in Kajiado had reported the matter to EACC. The Sh30,000 was in denominations of between Sh50 and Sh100.The officers took nearly 30 minutes counting the crumpled notes and later arrested the three.All the officers arrested in Kajiado and Kitengela towns were released on bond and are expected to appear in court on Monday.Kajiado Central OCPD, Moses Musundi, said he had no knowledge of the arrest in his area of jurisdiction but promised to follow up on the same.Read: EACC arrests Mombasa county askari, cop over corruption
