About 100 political hopefuls in Ukambani have declared they will run on the Jubilee ticket.They spoke after a meeting at the Scott Christian University on Tuesday. The aspirants warned against zoning of regions by political parties as their strongholds. The leaders took issue with Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka s claim that no Kamba will join the Jubilee Party.They said Musyoka, who made the comment during a rally in Kitengela on Saturday, should know every Kenyan has a right to belong to any political party she or he chooses.Former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile, who attended the meeting, said Kalonzo s statements amounted to intimidation of the Kamba community. There is nothing like party zones. That is a thing of the past. Any Kenyan has a right to join Jubilee, he said.Kalembe urged JP aspirants to report any threats. He said Wiper is not a threat to their political survival because it only won three out of eight MP seats in Machakos county in the March 4, 2013, elections. Machakos Senate hopeful Henry Kioko said Kalonzo s statement was reckless.On Sunday MPs Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central), Francis Mwangangi (Yatta), Richard Makenga (Kaiti) and Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni) gave Kalonzo to mid-November to convene a meeting about the political destiny of the Kamba community. Otherwise, they promised to make a declaration that will change the political landscape. They said the community risked political oblivion should it go divided to the 2017 general election. But Wiper organising secretary Robert Mbui told them to focus on their new Jubilee home. He said the legislators are hell-bent on getting unwarranted attention and said their ultimatum will be ignored. Let them proceed and do whatever they want to do. They should not wait for a single day, Mbui said. He said Wiper leadership is tired of irresponsible comments made by defectors.
