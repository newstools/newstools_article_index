NYS suspect Josephine Kabura's affidavit on the Sh791 million NYS scandal was absurd and an insult, political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi has said.Kabura implicated several people, including Ngunyi, former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru and Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, in the scam through the affidavit.But Ngunyi said, when he appeared before National Assembly Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday, that he had never met Kabura who is a Nairobi businesswoman."She is a fascinating specimen I would want to meet but no, I have never met her," he told the committee that is still grilling him in Parliament."I can swear... Bring me the bible," he also said, adding he had only seen her on television.Ngunyi further said he did not know how his firm was picked by the National Youth Service for consultancy services.He told the PAC that he learnt from the Auditor General's report in April 2015 that his firm had been overpaid by Sh12.5 million.Waiguru has in the past said her interactions with Ngunyi were based on the restructuring of the NYS and that he was representing 'The Consulting Firm' that had been contracted by the ministry to assist with the exercise.The analyst said cartels within the service wanted to implicate him in corruption deals because of his part in the restructuring."Corruption at NYS corrupts back. They overpaid me with the intention that I would keep the money," he said.NYS ifmis documents show that Mutahi Ngunyi of The Consulting House was paid Sh38.9 million for consultancy services for the implementation of the NYS 5-point Vision strategy.Ngunyi received Sh25 million (Sh12.5 million each) as quarterly payment while he received Sh10 million on May 27 and another Sh3.9 million on the same day as reimbursement costs while implementing the 5-point Vision strategy.Read: Central Bank of Kenya queries huge NYS paymentsHe earlier said he wired the excess amount back to Central Bank of Kenya on Monday.Ngunyi appeared today after failing to honour the summons last week on Wednesday.Committee chairman Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo said they had contacted him using an old email address.Read: Mutahi Ngunyi s firm ready to refund Sh11.8m excess payments if proved to be from NYS
