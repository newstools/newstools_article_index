Three MPs and a former cabinet secretary have for the second time lost a bid to strike out a defamation suit filed against them by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli.They are facing the suit for allegedly linking Atwoli and other Cotu officials to the death of Kabete MP George Muchai in March 2015.The four are former Labour CS Kazungu Kambi and MPs Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Francis Waititu alias Wakapee (Juja) and Alice Nganga (Thika Town).In their application, the four sought orders to strike out the case against them, arguing it was vague, general in nature and did not sufficiently disclose the defamation alluded to .While dismissing the application, justice Msagah Mbogoli said: "Striking out this suit is a drastic jurisdiction to be exercised sparingly and only in the clearest of cases. Such is not the case. Life can still be injected to the suit by amendment,"Mbogoli also directed Atwoli and Cotu officials to amend their complaint within 30 days and serve Kambi and Waititu.The suit against the four was filed by Atwoli, Cotu chairman Rajab Mwondi, treasurer Rebecca Nyathogora, deputy treasurer Washington Adongo, and trustees Francis Wangara and Joseph Nyabiya.Lawyer Samuel Aduda told the court that Kambi and the MPs uttered the words "the six Cotu officials are responsible for Muchai's death. We want to see them in handcuffs for Muchai's murder".They allegedly said this during Muchai's burial.The officials argued that Kambi and the MPs made no effort to verify the statements made amid investigations into the murder, and that they should have recorded statements with the police.But Kambi, through lawyer Philip Nyachoti, said that the exact words and/or statements he allegedly uttered concerning Atwoli and others were not set out in their case.Read: Unions ask Kambi, Kuria to apologise
