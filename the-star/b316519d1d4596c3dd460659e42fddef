Kenya emerged from the just-concluded global wildlife forum with a mixed bag of successes and failures.Kenya Wildlife Service director general Kitili Mbathi on Wednesday said the country's bid to give her elephants higher protection was "a qualified success.""We are happy with the results, because there will be no international trade in ivory and there will be tighter monitoring and control over the legal markets," he told the Star on the phone.Mbathi said countries with legal domestic markets will closely be monitored, but will be shut if found to engage in the illegal trade."There are some markets which are legal in places like Hong Kong, China and Japan. Those are legal domestic markets. We were able to get resolutions passed, which indicated these markets must be closed if they are linked to illegal ivory trade,"he said.The 17th session of parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species took place between September 24 to October 5.Kenya successfully managed to ban trade on pangolins.However, the European Union blocked a permanent ban on international trade in ivory, causing Kenya's year-long campaign a serious setback.This degenerated into a heated debate with senior adviser to Fondation Franz Weber and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation Rosalind Reeve, saying "the blood of Africa s elephants is in the EU s hands."The EU represented by the European Commission and participated as a full party.Environment CS Judi Wakhungu in her official Twitter handle on Monday wrote, "It is a sad day for elephants".In April, the government burned 105 tonnes of elephant ivory and 1.35 tonnes of rhino horn. President Uhuru Kenyatta said this was "to send a strong and clear statement to the world that ivory is worthless, unless it is on elephants".Kenya also failed to give to her close to 2,000 lions maximum protection in what experts blamed on "lack of sufficient evidence".Senior KWS warden Jirmo Tuqa said there has been no concerted efforts to have study about lions done."CITES wanted data... the other group that wants trade on lions parts as well as those who hunt win," he told the Star on the phone.Conservationists and researchers wanted African lion listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act for enhanced protection.The KWS says there were 2,749 lions in Kenya in 2002.Lion population dropped to 2,280 by 2004 and to roughly 2,000 today due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.Jirmo challenged research institutions and governments to document huge threats facing the lion .
