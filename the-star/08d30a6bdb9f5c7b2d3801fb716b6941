Residents of Homa Bay are forced to part with an average Sh1,654 for county government services, a report by the EACC states.The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission ranks Homa Bay seventh nationwide, according to estimates of county officials demanding bribes in exchange for services. The report was released on Wednesday at a Homa Bay hotel by the EACC during the opening of a public officers training session. The fact that these residents pay low amounts of money for bribes does not mean bribes are not paid, the EACC Director of Preventive Services Vincent Okong o said. What we have noticed implies that the residents may have to sell their chickens and goats in order to meet these bribery demands. He said the some county officials delay services to frustrate residents. One of the ways they do this is by arriving at the office late. No public officer is at liberty to absent themselves from work without a proper reason. This affects services, Okong o said.
