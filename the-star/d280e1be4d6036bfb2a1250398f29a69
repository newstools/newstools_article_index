There is a good case for the Jubilee Administration to move in and rescue Kenya Airways. However grim KQ s prospects look in the present circumstances of consecutive annual multiple-billion-shilling losses and the extremely controversial pilots strike, airlines go bust all the time.Some of the most iconic airlines in civil aviation history have taken performance and financial nosedives and lived to tell the tale, among them Air Canada, American Airlines, Delta and United.A key element of airline turnarounds has been requiring pilots to take huge pay cuts, dramatically reducing other jobs and securing government bailouts in which rescue loans are paid within a short time.Rescuing KQ is not reinventing the wheel. The example of American Airlines is key. It filed for bankruptcy in late 2011 and by early 2014 had partnered with US Airways Group to form the world s largest airline American Airlines Group and return to profitability.Giving up on KQ is too defeatist and injurious to the national economy to contemplate.
