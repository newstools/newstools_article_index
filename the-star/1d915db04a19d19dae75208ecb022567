In the last few years, Becky Sangolo and Carol Kamweru have been some of the most sought-after background vocalists in Kenya.However, the two singers (who met at Penya Afrika&rsquo;s Sauti Academy a few years ago while undertaking a vocal training course) finally decided to blendtheir voices and kick off their own music career.With their style, greatly influenced by dancehall and alternative reggae music, the two formed a singing duo called Band BeCa.According to the pair, they are about to shake things up in the Kenyan music industry.&quot;Who doesn&#39;t love a lady who brings it? One who walks talks and dresses however she pleases?&quot;One who doesn&#39;t care about anyone&#39;s opinion but her own and one who is not afraid to speak her mind?&quot;That&#39;s exactly what BeCa gives you!&quot; says Becky.Already, the new girl group has its debut single out titled Toka.The new jam is an assertive song dedicated to cheaters!The dancehall club banger tune was produced by the renowned producer Jacky B, with the video shot by the creative director, Sync.Watch Toka here:&nbsp;&nbsp;
