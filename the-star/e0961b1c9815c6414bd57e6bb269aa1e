Mumias East boda boda operators, who participated in Amani rallies two weeks ago, took to the streets on Tuesday demanding Sh100,000 payment.More than 200 of them were hired to accompany Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi during his tour of the area. We entered into an agreement with organiser David Wamatsi that we would be paid Sh500 each after the rallie," said Peter Osundwa, Shianda town bodaboda treasurer."We moved from Nyaporo, Isongo, Malaha, Shikulu to Kamashia and back to Shianda but the ANC members went without honouring our contract."Read: Stop burning bridges with ultimatums to defectors, Wangwe tells MudavadiThe riders dismissed Mudavadi s ambition for the presidency saying his foot soldiers would fail him terribly. If they cannot manage to pay this small number of motorcycle operators, how will they manage to run the country with billions of shillings? noted Osundwa.They said Wamatsi was being used by an influential person in Nairobi to mess the politics of Mumias East. We know his sponsor has issues in Mumias and wants somebody who will protect his interests," said Osundwa."He is giving Wamatsi millions of shillings to campaign in Mumias East constituency so that he can disrupt the area politics and safeguard his interests."Read: Wanga elders back Mudavadi for PresidentThe operators blocked Shianda-Malaha road and disrupted operations on the busy Kakamega-Mumias road. They also destroyed and burned portraits of Mudavadi and Wamatsi whom they described as inept leaders.Business was closed at Shianda whose businessmen feared losing their property.Boda boda rider George Were said Wamatsi had switched off his phone and was avoiding them. If he will not pay us we shall camp in his home and see if he will avoid entering his residence. We will eventually ensure he doesn t campaign for ANC in Mumias, Were said.He said majority of the operators have families that depend solely on them.
