Kandara MP Alice Wahome has accused Murang a Governor Mwangi Wairia of mismanaging public resources and told him to account for Sh25 billion allocated over the years. The MP said on Tuesday funds allocated to the county since the onset of devolution are not reflected on the ground. She said a lot of cash is in the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.Wahome said the county has killed residents expectations of devolution s benefits. Poor prioritisation of projects has led to underdevelopment in most of the county, especially Murang a South, Wahome said.Speaking when she presented a Sh500,000 cheque to Kagundu-ini Primary School in her constituency, Wahome told Wairia to account for the Sh25 billion received from Treasury. Our people never asked for nappier grass, sweet potato vines or manure. This was a scheme by the governor and allies to stomach public resources. How can they account? People want access to clean water, good roads and good health facilities with enough drugs and medics, she said.Wahome accused Wairia of playing mindgames by initiating projects that can t be easily accounted for.Wairia says his foes are scheming to undermine his tenure as governor.
