By sheer good luck Kenya has always been ahead of our neighbours. But now they are embracing sane politics and rational economic policies that could bring prosperity to their peopleThe debate on how Kenya is losing out on major infrastructure projects within the East African region has been largely dominated by what the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman defined as emotionally satisfying fictions .There have been accusations flung at our government over the Ugandans preference for routing their crude oil pipeline through Tanzania as though there could be any question of routing this pipeline through Kenya s lawless northern frontier, where it would immediately be a prime target for the terrorists who have long roamed that wilderness.Further anguish has arisen over the doubts as to whether our potentially white elephant standard gauge railway will really go all the way to Uganda and Rwanda. Some amateur analysts even suggested that if our intelligence agencies had done a better job of spying on our neighbours, we would have outwitted Tanzania over the oil pipeline.But there is a greater point here: even if northern Kenya was the ideal route for that oil pipeline, and even if the SGR really made a lot of economic sense, there would still be no reason to regret that our neighbouring countries are set to benefit from improved regional infrastructure that Kenya has no part in.There are many reasons for this, but I will only mention the two most important ones here.Let me start by pointing out that Kenyans rarely seem to acknowledge that the reason why we have for so long been the dominant economic power in this region has as much to do with good luck as anything else. At independence we received from the departing British colonists a far superior public infrastructure than any of our neighbouring countries had at that time. Then we were spared the curse of well-meaning but ultimately delusional leaders like Tanzania s Julius Nyerere, who sought to create a socialist paradise in his country, while at the same time receiving more donor aid than any other African country, thus making his country tragically donor-dependent.Finally, we were not at any point ruled by lunatics like Uganda s Idi Amin, or by despotic Emperors like Ethiopia s Haile Selassie. And we did not experience any genocide like Rwanda or Burundi. Or decades of civil war like South Sudan.All this enabled us to race ahead of the other East African nations. But that did not mean that we would remain ahead indefinitely. It was always just a matter of time before these other nations also found their bearings and embraced sane politics and rational economic policies that could bring some degree of prosperity to their people.And this brings me to the second and most important point: If there is one thing that Kenyans should wish for more than anything else in pursuit of our own geostrategic interests, it is to see our neighbours prosper.We tend to focus on our tourist markets in Europe, as well as our exports (again mostly to European nations) of fresh flowers and vegetables, as well as tea and coffee.But Uganda is actually our most important trading partner. And the more prosperous the Ugandans become, the more they will import manufactured goods from Kenya, as well as use services provided by the top Kenyan banks, insurance companies, supermarket chains and hotels that have already set up shop all over East Africa. Even Kenya Airways is really more a regional airline than a national one.Going back to Krugman, he pointed out in one of his essays that Ultimately, an economy must serve consumers . So we should learn to value all those consumers in Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and Tanzania who buy Kenyan and (incidentally) build Kenya.Finally, Krugman one of the world s leading experts on international trade cautioned that Even though world trade is larger than ever before, national living standards are overwhelmingly determined by domestic factors rather than some competition for world markets .From this perspective, it is immoral as well as bad policy for us to panic and engage in talk of being overtaken each time there is a sign that our previously poor neighbours are about to move up the ladder of prosperity.
