For thousands of years, human beings worked until they could work no more. When they were wrinkled and hobbled by age, they handed over their land to their families and relied on their heirs to take care of them. But then came the industrial revolution, and urbanisation quickly after. A change in social economics that led to a new question: how do you take care of old people when their arthritic limbs can no longer manage carrying bales of cotton, or when they start wheezing alarmingly on account of working in coal-powered factories? Answer: state pensions, which, just like today, were meagre, but combined with the generous company pensions that followed, suddenly made it possible for people to leave work at 65 and still have an income that was enough to live on. A new stage of life came into being retirement. We now had a three-stage life: education, career, retirement. Problem is, nobody anticipated the life-prolonging advances in medicine and public health. Advances that meant more people were getting to old age, staying there longer, and leading healthy lives. Companies with their generous pensions now had a problem. They had promised too much, to too many people, who were now living for far too long. It was unsustainable. What to do but to cut pensions. Which brings us to where we are today, looking forward to pensions that are a pale shadow of the retirement benefits enjoyed by previous generations. The solution is a life where you rearrange the stages whichever way you want you could be an undergrad at 20, 40, or 60, or you could change careers radically at age 30, 50, or 70. Different jobs and different stages, learning how to reinvent yourself in whichever way your mood, age, and aptitude takes you.I ve never seen the attraction of sitting around in old age, waiting for death to come calling. I m looking forward to the new old age, one where I ll have lived multiple lives.
