Australian mining company Base Titanium is yet to receive a licence for expanding its area of operations in Kwale, CS Dan Kazungu has said.The Mining Cabinet Secretary said on Tuesday that the company applied for the extension but that he referred it to the county government and locals, in line with new mining laws.He said the ministry was ready to issue the document but that the company will follow due processes, according to the new act.Kazungu told the Star by phone that the company has spent more than Sh40 billion putting up facilities but will have to comply with Mining Act 2016 passed on May 27. The planned investment amounts to Sh100 billion. I have not given any licence. The company is supposed to do feasibility studies first and before that they must get consent," he said."I gave them consent to get an agreement with the county government and the people."The CS explained that to get a licence, Base must obtain approval from the Mineral Rights Board and follow all procedures.The board will check the application and advise the CS on whether or not to issue the licence.Base Titanium had reported securing a licence to explore for more minerals in Kwale, signaling a mine life extension for the Kwale mineral sand project.Base said it has been granted exploration tenure on land surrounding its current Kwale operations, bringing the total prospecting area to 177 square kilometres from 56.Read more: Base Titanium gets nod to expand Kwale mineKazungu responded on Monday to claims by Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi that he was to blame for the licensing of the company. Mudavadi noted the mining activities will lead to the eviction of hundreds of people.He also said he had received complaints from residents who said they feared eviction.But the CS accused him of inciting Kwale residents by claiming they were not consulted on the project.He asked Mudavadi to stop inciting and misinforming people but seek to understand the Act before going public on money matters. Why is Mudavadi inciting people of Kwale yet he was quiet when we spent more than Sh4 billion to conduct mining surveys in Vihiga?" he asked.Kazungu said Mudavadi, as former finance minister and vice president, should not use land issues to misinform the people of Kwale for political gain. I expect Mudavadi to tell them the truth, that a company did an airborne survey, he said, adding the project was a multi-billion shilling investment.Kazungu noted his ministry was setting up a Sh80 million granite processing factory in Vihiga.He said there was also an investor who surveyed for gold in four counties in Mudavadi's Western region, at a cost of Sh4 billion I have Sh3 billion in my ministry to do air borne surveys in the country to search for all sources of minerals. Phase one will be in Western Kenya where there is potential for gold, he said.Read: Base Titanium cries foul as rival firm gets mining licenceAlso read: Ministry Of mines is failing Kenyans
