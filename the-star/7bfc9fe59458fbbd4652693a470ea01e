Governor Moses Akaranga should be arrested and charged for his administration s financial irregularities, Vihiga MP Yusuf Chanzu has said. He said contracts for Sh2 billion projects have not been paid for. The contractors have approached me for advice over the delayed payments and I will join them in their plans to sue the county government, Chanzu told the Star on the phone. He said the Senate is investigating the county government over Sh2.5 billion that is unaccounted for. If Akaranga cannot pay contractors for tenders awarded two years ago, where will he get the money he is promising the contractors, yet the county is set to receive Sh4.5 billion this financial year? Chanzu asked. He said Akaranga should explain the whereabouts of money allocated for projects. The contractors, led by Alfred Okubi, said they will petition the Senate to ask the IEBC to bar Akaranga from running for reelection. Akaranga could not be reached for comment as he was in France over the weekend. But county head of communications Peter Athiaya said the hitch that led to the delays had been resolved and payment has started.
