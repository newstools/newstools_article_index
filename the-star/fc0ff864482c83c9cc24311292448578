Nobody was injured in the fire that started as students were in class for weekend and private studies.School principal Roselyn Akoth said 188 students lost their property.

However, we only managedto salvage a few items, Omedo said.Homa Bay police commander John Omusanga said the cause of the fire is yet to be established but investigations are underway.
