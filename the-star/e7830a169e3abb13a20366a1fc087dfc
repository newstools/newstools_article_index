Germany on Wednesday expressed concern over increased cases of extrajudicial killings in Kenya.Ambassador Jutta Frasch said measures against terrorism must be taken, but they should be lawful. She said radicalisation should be dealt with, but suspects should not be gunned down.Religious leaders and human rights defenders frequently express concerns over killings and disappearances of suspects. They said the recent killing of three women suspected to have attacked the Mombasa central police station during the 9-11 anniversary was extrajudicial. But the state has denied culpability.Frasch spoke in Mombasa during celebrations of the Day of German Unity. Germany encourages initiatives in the interests of order and peace, a precondition for economic growth, she said.She said Coast is worst-hit by conflicts. Frasch praised efforts by Kenya to stabilise Somalia and condemned terror attacks resulting from the intervention in Somalia by Kenyan troops. One of the projects we support at the Coast deals with the reintegration of former members of armed groups into society, she said. Frasch thanked the state for allowing refugee repatriation on a strictly voluntary basis, which is dignified and in full accordance with international law.
