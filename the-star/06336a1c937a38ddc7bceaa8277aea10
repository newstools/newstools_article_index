The Mombasa Sh9 billion budget for 2016-17 is not pro-poor and totally against the budget making process, Senator Hassan Omar has said.He said the Sh390 million set aside for the purchase of a residence was not well elaborated. The only purchase of a residence, as far as I understand, should be the governor's residence. We all know that the governor does not have an official residence, but Sh390 million is a lot of money. Mombasa economy does not allow such of wastage, Omar said yesterday.A governor does not need a palace to stay in, when thousands of residents are living in squalor and abject poverty , he said.Omar, who wants to run for governor, said the Mombasa government did not involve residents in the budget-making process as required by the constitution.The county has increased levies for small-scale traders instead of giving them incentives to boost their businesses, he said. It is totally uncalled for to see a government making the cost of doing business unbearable to Mama Mboga. These are people who should be supported, Omar said.He spoke during a public forum on the Mombasa budget review at the Whitesands Hotel.Omar criticised Mombasa's huge spending on the cultural festival, ODM 10th anniversary party and the streets food festival, which he termed a waste of public resources.Mombasa county government officials, who had not been invited to the budget review, came in large numbers. Mombasa County does not need to fear its citizens when they sit somewhere and review its progress. This is panic, when you literally close down shops to bring here seven county executives and a whole litany of the Finance office. It is actually laughable, Omar said.Those who attended the meeting were Trade executive Hamisi Mwaguya, Binti Omar (Tourism), Hazel Koitaba (Finance), Tendai Lewa (Education) and Fatma Awale (Water).Koitaba said what was being discussed touched on the county and they should be represented.Omar responded, saying Why didn t the county invite us during the budget-making process?
