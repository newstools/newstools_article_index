The Federal Party of Kenya has written to its MPs and MCAs who defected to the newly formed Jubilee Party to relinquish their positions.New party leader Andrew Kutitila, who took over office yesterday, said the legislators have abandoned FPK.He told the Star that the party officials have written to Ganze MP Peter Shehe, Butula MP Michael Onyura, Tana River Senator Ali Bule, Hamisi MP Charles Gimose and several MCAs to quit the party so that by-elections are held. As a party we are not supporting Jubilee or Cord. We are an independent party and will not accept people to use our party to get to power and later abandon it. If they do not quit, we are going to court to compel the registrar of parties, IEBC, Senate speaker, National Assembly speaker and speakers of various counties to be asked to declare the seats vacant, Kutitila said.
