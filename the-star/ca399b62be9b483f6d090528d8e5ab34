Mwala MP Vincent Musyoka accused ODM leader Raila Odinga of playing mind games with the Kamba community and its leaders. We expected Raila will endorse Kalonzo this time round. But to our surprise, we have now started hearing them talking of Joho. What will be the reason for us being in the opposition? he asked.Masinga MP Itwiku Mbia said the Kambas were not ready to be taken for fools any more . We have eyes and we can see. Not again will we will we vote to be in the opposition , Itwiku said.Mbooni MP Michael Kisoi said it was time the community rethinks of its political direction since its future in opposition was bleak.He said they were ready to pay the price and ensure that the community forms the next government.Machakos town MP Victor Munyaka said, Only a devil won t see the development the Jubilee government has initiated in this area. Deputy President William Ruto said the government was committed to serving all Kenyans without discrimination.
