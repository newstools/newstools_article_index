Property worth millions of shillings was last night destroyed after a fire burnt down 32 stalls in Kahawa Wendani, Kiambu county.The cause of the 3am fire is not known.Kahawa Wendani chief Christine Makimei said she received a call from a distressed woman at 4.45am that some people were screaming in the area.She said they later confirmed the screams were from the stall owners."We called in the county fire brigade, only for the first fire engine to arrive without enough water. We called in the second and finally the third one that managed to put it off. By that time, the fire had destroyed a lot of property, nothing was salvaged," Makimei said.The stalls had pubs, salons, barber shops, grocery stalls, boutiques, butcheries and general shops.Butcher Martin Muhoro said he lost 32kg of meat, more than 150 pieces of chicken stored in a deep freezer and kitchen appliances."My losses amount to about Sh200,000. I suspect the fire might have been started by someone for unknown reasons. The fire engine disappointed us, it arrived at 6am, hours after we called them," he said."I lost everything including my clothes. I have nothing left," stall owner Esther Muthoni said.Ruiru MP Esther Gathogo urged the business owners to remain calm as police investigate."I have talked to the area police boss and the incident is being investigated," she said.She asked hoteliers in Ruiru to always ensure they put off the fire they use for cooking before they close for the night.
