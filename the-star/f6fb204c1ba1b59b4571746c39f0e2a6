State House this morning will host a youth summit at a time when the Jubilee manifesto on job creation is far from being met.In their manifesto, President Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) and Deputy President William Ruto promised to create one million jobs annually, pegging most of their hopes on a shift in the public procurement policy towards prioritising locally produced goods.Jubilee also said it would set aside 30 per cent of the government tenders for the youth and women. The Jubilee administration had also hoped to generate jobs by growing the manufacturing sector, through tax incentives and extending grants to the international companies to establish plants. It is time to take stock of our successes to see what improvements are possible. That is what tomorrow s youth summit is about. It brings together government and the youth, as well as civil society and the private sector so that we can all reflect on our progress, State House said yesterday.The statement said the Jubilee administration took office at a time when the youth agenda had never been more important . In recognition of its centrality, new policies were made and new programmes launched. We now have the Uwezo Fund and expanded opportunities for the youth in government procurement, the statement says.State House said the government has set aside money for training young people, while launching new programmes to digitise learning and new partnerships with the private sector.
