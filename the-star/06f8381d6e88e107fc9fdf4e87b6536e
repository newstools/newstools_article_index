Members of Viwandani's Abagusii community have defended Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero against impeachment, following a motion by their MCA.Omogusii in Nairobi Forum chairman Joseph Nyandika said they were disappointed at MCA Samwel Nyang'wara's "unbecoming behaviour".They said he is trying to have Kidero impeached over lack of development an funds misuse yet he has not been accountedfor resources allocated to his ward."He does not even have an office for the ward's operations. Nyang'wara has not properly distributed bursaries. More than half of what was allocated is yet to be accounted for," a resident said.The residents termed the ODM ward representative's actions an effort towards gaining political mileage against Jubilee.They said he was determined "to an extent that he has forgotten the party through which he was elected".Nyandika demanded that ODM removes the MCA's name from its register to allow the people of Viwandani to elect a new leader ready to work for them.Resident Robinson Kombo apologised to Kidero for Nyang'wara's actions."We thank governor Kidero for supporting the development agenda of Viwandani residents. But we are very apologetic for the MCA's actions," he said.MCAs who attended a meeting at Orange House on Wednesday said they had planned for residents to sign a petition to recall Nyang'wara for non-performance.Nyang'wara tabled his motion on Tuesday. The next step is for the House Business Committee to allocate it time for debate.More on this: Kidero impeachment motion tabled despite fracas at Nairobi assemblyThe motion resulted in chaos at the assembly and summonses for Speaker Alex Magelo and clerk Jacob Ngwele to appear before the EACC to explain what happened.The MCA was removed from three county assembly committees and rebuked by ODM, but he said he will seek court action in returning to at least one of the committees.Read: MCA behind Kidero impeachment motion removed from assembly committees
