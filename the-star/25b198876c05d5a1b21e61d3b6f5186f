Zuma will also meet South Africans in Kenya and hold talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta. The two are expected to sign deals on visas and joint counter-terrorism strategies.Nairobi had in the past complained that South Africa had imposed stringent rules for Kenyans."We expect to strike an agreement on visas, which have sometimes posed a problem for Kenyans looking to travel to South Africa, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said on Sunday.
