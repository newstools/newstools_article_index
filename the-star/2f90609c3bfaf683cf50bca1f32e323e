Nema on Friday suspended operations of a Jaribuni quarry, run by a Chinese engineering firm, for violating environmental laws.This came after persistent pleas by residents and Kaya elders that the company was destroying the environment, especially the indigenous Kaya Kauma Forest. County director Samuel Lopokoiyit, accompanied by MCA Emanuel Chai, visited the quarry and issued orders stopping operations, until it complies with all requirements. The company makes ballast for the Lapsset project. We have told them to instal dust arresters to end emissions that are affecting the community. We have also told them to erect a perimeter wall to protect River Jaribuni from their activities, Lopokoiyit said.
