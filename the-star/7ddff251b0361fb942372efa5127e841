Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi has said Cord coalition parties will not defeat Jubilee if they go it alone. He said there is no way ODM, Ford Kenya and Wiper will win the presidency if they don t field one candidate to face President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Cord coalition partners should not brag that they will defeat Jubilee if they disintegrate and field their own candidates, Wamunyinyi said. Speaking at the Kanduyi Red Cross offices when he met Ford Kenya officials from his constituency, he urged Cord co-principals Raila Odinga, Moses Wetang ula and Kalonzo Musyoka to work as team and support whoever wins a joint nomination. We have tried going it alone previously and lost. Let nobody lie they can go it alone and win, Wamunyinyi said. Wamunyinyi, the Bungoma county Ford Kenya chairman, urged Wetang ula to stick with Cord even if he does not become the presidential flagbearer. He said the Cord co-principals should not insist they must be nominated as flagbearers because there are many senior positions they can get if the opposition wins .
