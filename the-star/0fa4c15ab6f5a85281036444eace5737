Senate clerk Jeremiah Nyegeye this afternoon is expected to brief the House on the status of all petitions filed since 2013.On Wednesday last week, deputy speaker Kembi Gitura directed the clerk to furnish the House with reports on progress inhandling the petitions. There are petitions pending in committees for a very long time. I direct the clerk s office to prepare a matrix of all the petitions, indicating those that have been delivered, when they were delivered and those that are pending and for how long and why, Kembi said. This is because petitioners are out there still waiting. I am sure maybe they do not know the Standing Orders state that petitions should be responded to within 60 days. The deputy speaker said he would like to have a complete matrix of all the petitions today.Last week, Senate minority leader Moses Wetang ula said committees take too long to dispose of petitions.
