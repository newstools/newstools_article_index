He said the offices they will open tomorrow will accommodate all Jubilee supporters in the constituency. Sunkuli s meeting after he opened the office was attended only by members of his Moitanik clan, yet we have the Uasin Gishu and Siria clans of the Maasai community, and also the Kipsigis community, who are residents of this constituency.
