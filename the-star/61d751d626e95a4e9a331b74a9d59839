Atwoli said Raila remarks should not be taken lightly. Let Jubilee administration stop the tendency of rushing to dismiss what Raila says over this multibillion water project. It is prudent for them to conduct investigations first, Atwoli said.The Cotu boss argued that it would be disastrous if the government implements the project if it has an adverse environmental impact.He asked Murang a politicians and residents to allow experts to conduct investigations, adding that Raila is not interested in the county politics. Murang a leaders must pay keen attention to what Raila is saying. Raila talked about NYS fund loss and it became true hence on this water issue he should be given attention rather than mere dismissals, Atwoli said.Atwoli's remarks were echoed by Tana River county leaders who opposed to the plans of diverting River Tana water.The leaders claimed that this will affect livelihoods of more than 200,000 people.Former Garsen Member of Parliament Danson Mungatana who led the leaders said the residents solely depend on the river for farming and pastoralists activities.Mungatana called on Water CS not to approve the project until the locals are involved and told of the effects of diverting the river from upstream. Tana River county is always left out whenever discussions are made about the river Tana, the county depends on the river for its livelihood, he said.
