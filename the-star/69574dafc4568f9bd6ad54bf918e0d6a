Cord leader Raila Odinga will be in Eldoret on Saturday for his first major rally in in more than a year in Deputy President William Ruto s backyard.However, it is not clear if Raila will be in the region for a week-long tour of Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Elgeyo Marakwet, Trans Nzoia and West Pokot.The opposition yesterday paid Sh100,000 to book the 64 Stadium, for the main rally after a procession in Eldoret town. The trip has been postponed several times, but it has been planned to take place from October 1, said Kipkorir Menjo. He is ODM secretary of Constitutional Affairs. Preparations are complete. We are now mobilising residents to turn up in large numbers. Raila will camp in the Rift Valley to popularise his presidential bid, despite his uphill task to penetrate the region ahead of the 2017. It is perceived as a Jubilee stronghold.The ODM leader will attend a service at Segero SDA Church before addressing road side meetings on the way to the stadium. The defection of all his key allies a few years ago has left Raila with no strong point men to enable him get a grip on Rift Valley. We have our own strategy for the region and it will be unveiled when he comes, Menjo said.Sources said Raila plans to use key elders led by veteran politician Jackson Kibor to woo the Kalenjin community.Before the 2007 polls, Raila had been nicknamed Arap Mibey in the region because of the wide support he enjoyed when he was with Ruto in ODM. But he now has to put in place new political plans. Menjo said a programme for his planned visit will be made public soon.Ruto faces a growing rebellion in the region after Kanu, NVP and Chama Cha Mashinani refused to dissolve to join the new Jubilee Party. There are fears some of the key leaders and supporters may back the opposition next year. Raila enjoys considerable support in the Rift Valley, ODM Uasin Gishu chairman David Songok said. Considering the Jubilee failures, he will likely get more support as we head to the next elections.
