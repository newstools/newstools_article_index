Members of the Gachiege EAPC Church in Imenti North constituency have barred MCA Samson Thuranira from attending church event for allegedly insulting their pastor.The MCA is alleged to have called Pastor Joshua Mwenda Kumbafu after he accused him of using his key opponent at the 2017 general elections Edwin Bundi as the key organiser for a harambee.The fundraiser was attended by Igembe South MP and Igembe South MP Meru Mithika Linturi. But Thuranira has denied the allegations terming them "unfounded". Nothing like that happened and I never insulted anybody. If they continue with such reports I will consider suing them in court for tarnishing my name. Those are falsehoods, he said.A colleague of the pastor, Jeremy Kiogora, said the MCA has also opposed attempts by church leaders to secure county government bursaries for the orphaned and vulnerable children supported by the church.
