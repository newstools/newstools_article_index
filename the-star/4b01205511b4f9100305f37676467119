It was unconstitutional for Bungoma county to pass a law allowing the sale and consumption of illicit liquor, Interior PS Karanja Kibicho has said. He said national law bans the sale and drinking of busaa and any local law stating otherwise is null and void. No county can create a law that contradicts the laws of the country, Kibicho said. He spoke on Tuesday during a visit to county commissioner Joshua Chepchieng at the county headquarters in Bungoma town. The assembly passed the Bungoma County Alcoholic Drinks Control Act on February 25. Governor Kenneth Lusaka assented to it on March 3. Kibicho said busaa is still regarded as an illicit brew. Busaa must first pass the standard specifications set out. It must meet health, preservation and manufacturing standards and be certified by Kebs, without which it will remain illegal, he said. Lusaka said the law will regulate production, sale, distribution and consumption of traditional brews and other alcoholic beverages. He said traders will have to apply for licences from subcounty committees and be cleared by public health officers to sell the brew at marketplaces.
