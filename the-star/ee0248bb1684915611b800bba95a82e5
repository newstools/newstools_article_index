Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero's impeachment motion suffered a setback on Tuesday after the Speaker adjourned the sitting for lack of quorum.Alex Magelo adjourned after all Cord and 20 Jubilee MCAs boycotted the session. A section of the Cord MCAs instead convened at Boulevard hotel. Some of their Jubilee counterparts claimed Kidero "paid" the ward representatives to boycott the sitting in a bid to frustrate the ouster bid.Kahawa West MCA Ngaruiya Chege said the assembly leadership had decided to proceed with the impeachment debate despite a court order restraining the same.A High Court on Monday ordered that the impeachment motion is shelved until Kidero's application against it is heard and determined."This is a constitutional process that the court cannot interfere with. The Governor has realised that. He is buying everybody to boycott the session," claimed Ngaruiya.Ngaruiya said Kidero promised to pay the MCAs money equivalent to their three-day allowances. The MCAs are paid Sh3,900 per sitting.Nairobi has 127 MCAs so it would take about 43 (a third) for assembly business to proceed.It would take 87 MCAs to impeach Kidero; at least 56 Cord and Jubilee MCAs signed the petition.Kidero's lawyers led by county attorney Gad Awuonda and lawyer George Kithi said the court order barring the motion must be obeyed.Last week, Viwandani MCA Samwel Nyang'wara, who tabled the motion for the Nairobi Governor's impeachment, was discharged from three assembly committees.He was removed from the business, health services; and trade, tourism and cooperatives committees.Nyang'wara tabled the impeachment motion at the assembly on October 4 after his first attempt on September 29 turned chaotic.Ward representatives still caused drama despite a warning by Magelo that those responsible for the first incident would be punished.[VIDEO] Nairobi MCAs throw punches as Kidero impeachment motion tabledRead: Kidero impeachment motion tabled despite fracas at Nairobi assemblyThe motion, that arose from claims Kidero has violated the constitution and misappropriated funds, was approved on October 6.
