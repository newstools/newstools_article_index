The Jubilee Party will push for a six-piece suit voting pattern in the Rift Valley to lock out Kanu and Chama Cha Mashinani.Leaders tasked with popularising the party in the region have begun drumming up support for the voting pattern urging residents to reject aspirants who will run on party tickets other than other than JP s. We want a situation where right from the President, senators, governors, MPs, Woman Reps to MCAs, all will be Jubilee Party members. This will make it easy to govern and implement the government s plans, Nandi Senator Stephen Sang said.Sang said voters should not be duped into voting for President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto on the JP ticket and at the same time elect other leaders through other party tickets. If you choose to give President Uhuru and DP Ruto the mandate to lead, then give them the full mandate. Those talking of madoadoa should not be allowed to confuse our people. We don t want to have county assemblies and a Parliament that will make it hard to lead and implement our manifesto, he said.His sentiments were echoed by Governor Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Turbo MP Elisha Busienei.The move to market the six-piece suit voting pattern comes amid fears within Jubilee that fallouts during the nominations may lead to protest votes to the advantage of Kanu and Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto s CCM.Rutto has said his party will not field a presidential candidate but it will field strong candidates for all the other positions. We already have strong aspirants joining our party. We expect them to win so that they can push our agenda in both the county assemblies and Parliament, he said.
