Four fringe players Samantha Akinyi, Mercy Achieng, Terry Ouko and Jackline Akoth finally made their d buts as the national women s football team Harambee Starlets humiliated Zanzibar 11-0 in their last group A match of the Cecafa women s championship at the Technical Institute Njeru in Jinja, Uganda yesterday.The move by the national team head coach David Ouma to rest regular players including current Kenya top scorer Esse Akida, Neddy Atieno, Vivian Akinyi, Mary Kinuthia, Cheris Avilia and Carolyne Onyango didn t tamper with the country s winning groove as the fringe players put their best foot forward to rise to the occasion.Experienced national team player Doreen Nabwire could have put Kenya in the lead barely nine minutes into the match but her shot hit the lower post. However, this was just a sign of good things to come as Christine Nafula tapped in the opener three minutes later after a cross from Mercy Achieng.In the 32nd minute, Nafula was on the mark again with her second goal as Kenya dominated the proceedings. Jacky Ogol wrapped up the first half with the third goal in the 45th minute to go to the break 3-0 up.On resumption, with barely three minutes of play, Achieng scored the fourth goal as Kenyans intensified sought to end the group stages on a high. At this point Kenya coach Ouma introduced Atieno, Kinuthia and Akida for Elizabeth Ambogo, Mercy Achieng and Nabweire.The tactic paid off as the combination of the trio opened the flood gates with Nafula scoring her third goal of the match in the 68th minute. Ogol added her second goal in the 70th minute to make it 6-0.Buoyed by their massive lead, Akida added the seventh goal in the 72nd minute after shooting past Zanzibar keeper Amina Kitambi before Vivian Corazone netted the eighth goal six minutes later.Akida was on target again in the 82nd minute, as Corazone wrapped up the the Kenyan win with the scores in the 88 and 91st minutes respectively.Kenya will know their semi-final opponents today after Pool B match between Tanzania and Ethiopia. The two teams are tied at the summit with three points.
