A strong Kenya Ports Authority women basketball team contingent of 26 leave Mombasa tomorrow morning by road to da-es-Salaam, Tanzania for the FIBA Afrique Zone5 Club Championship starting on Saturday.The 10-day event, which runs through to October 8, has attracted seven women and eight men s teams from the zone. Notable absentees are men s defending champions Egypt who will not be sending a team. Kenya Ports Authority women, who missed last year s event in Rwanda have re-grouped and will be going for nothing short of the title, according to sports official Lenox Safari. We are sending a strong squad, which should have little difficulty in reclaiming the regional title which has eluded us for the past three years, Safari said.His sentiments were echoed by head coach Anthony Ojukwu, who said the women trophy belongs to KPA and should therefore return to Mombasa. We are going to collect what belongs to us and we are leaving nothing to chance in our quest to achieve exactly that, Ojukwu said. Other women teams at the championships include KCCA and Uganda Christian University of Kampala, Ubumwe (Rwanda), USIU (Kenya), Don Bosco and Jeshi La Kujenga Taifa (Tanzania) and a team from Somalia.
