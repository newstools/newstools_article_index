Machakos Secondary School students on Monday were sent home indefinitely following reports of a planned strike.Problems began after the Cultural Day on Saturday. The students said they fundraised for the event, only to be given a raw deal. The school has a population of about 1, 200 and each student contributed Sh1,000 for the event about Sh1.2 million. We were shocked the management only spent about Sh100, 000. We were only served white rice and pilau, a student said on Monday.He said they paid for a DJ but the management cancelled. The students said there were discrepancies in their fees structure. About Sh530 could not be accounted for, a student said. Principal Masaku Muia denied the claims, saying the students were angry he didn t allow a DJ to perform.
