The assault case against Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has stalled after the complainant refused to hand over a medical report confirming he was injured.Dr Sebastian Khayombe reported to Mumias police station, saying Ojaamong and two other men beat him, fractured his leg and bruised his shoulders during a political debate at a bar two weeks ago.He said he was beaten after mentioning Jubilee. The Star has learnt the case stalled after the doctor decided not to hand over the medical examination report to investigators.A source close to the investigators said without the P3 medical report, the DCI cannot proceed with investigations. The complainant has declined to hand it over to the investigators but we hear there have been negotiations to have the matter settled out of court, a senior police officer at the Kakamega police headquarters said. Khayombe had said Ojaamong and his allies threw a chair at him and kicked him after a debate went sour. He said the debate was whether Jubilee or ODM would form the next government. Khayombe said Ojaamong and the two other men punched him when he said he supports neither Cord nor Jubilee. They suddenly became very angry when I mentioned Jubilee, he said. They asked me why I had mentioned it in the conversation and started kicking and punching me. Khayombe said Ojaamong and the men left the bar in a huff at 8pm.He said he has a doctor s report confirming his left leg was fractured and has a swelling on the left arm and head.Khayombe said he does not know the governor or the two other men personally.He said they met at the bar and started discussions about politics over drinks. Ojaamong was unavailable for comment.
