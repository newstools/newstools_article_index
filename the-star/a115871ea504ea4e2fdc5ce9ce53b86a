Some 18,000 ID cards are lying uncollected in registration offices in Migori. Yesterday, registration officers John Omeme from Rongo and Seth Mboya from Migori town said there are 10,000 and 8,000 uncollected ID cards, respectively. We are using chiefs and local leaders to help locate them, Omeme said.They attributed the high number to politicians initiatives to get more people to register as voters. Migori governor aspirant Anne Anyanga targets to register 20,000 new voters in one month. The My ID, My Life drive will end on October 16. We had earlier set a target of 15,000 new applicants but for the past two weeks we have noticed the demand has gone up, Anyanga said.Shem Were, the Suna West constituency ODM secretary said they registered voters in Osiri, Nyatike constituency, and Mabera, Kuria West, on Friday. In the two centres, we had 205 new applicants and we expect to get more as we have 12 and 15 centres to tackle in Kuria West and Nyatike, he said.Were said since they began, they have registered 332 new applicants in Suna West, 670 in Uriri, 53 in Kuria East and 122 in Awendo subcounty.
