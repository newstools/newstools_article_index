People from Coast are more generous than those from Nandi, an inspector of police told the National Police Service Commission vetting panel in Nakuru yesterday.Joseph Omwaga, who is attached to Nandi Hills Traffic base, shocked the panel when he told them that friends from the Coast region would send him money even without him requesting it when he was stationed there, unlike in Nandi.His total income from his businesses was estimated to be at Sh1.7 million, but his transaction deals amounted to over Sh3 million all done through M-Pesa in 2012.Asked about his mobile money transactions that exceeded his income, he cited the kindness of strangers. I had a good rapport with people I did business with and those I worked with in traffic. They sent me money even without my asking for it, said Omwaga.He had sent his wife cash through M-Pesa 376 times in two years and he had other 450 concealed deposits.
