Cord leader Raila Odinga s daughter Rosemary (pictured left) said on Saturday her father s wish is to end historical land injustices in Kajiado and Narok. She said her father shared a lot about the problems the Maasai people are going through with William ole Ntimama before his death.Rosemary spoke in Kapiti when David Kimiti of ODM launched his campaigns for Kajiado East MP. She said she supports her father s wish and will always stand by him in uniting the Maasai. I stand before you today to bring you this message from my father, who loves you very much. It is out of that love that the Maasais in Kajiado gave me the name Naserian and I am proud of it. My name is Rosemary Naserian Odinga, Rosemary said. She told the Maasai to troop to ODM so their problems can be rightfully tackled . I was once told by a Maasai elder that when it rains in Maasailand, men do not sleep in their houses, but spend the night protecting their livestock from imminent attacks by marauding hyenas. I want you to protect what is rightfully yours by refusing to sleep. Register in large numbers and use your votes to elect upright leaders, Rosemary said.Kimiti, who will vie against Peris Tobiko, said his choice of ODM was agreed on after many meetings with elders and youth. He will face off with Kakuta Maimai in the party nominations. ODM national youth chairman John Ketora said Raila will meet all the candidates vying for different seats across the country at the Bomas of Kenya on Friday.
