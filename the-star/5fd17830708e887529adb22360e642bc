Mandera elders' move to back senior Ministry of Devolution administrator Hassan Noor for governor has hit a snag.Noor has been endorsed by his local Garre clan elders. Governor Ali Roba and a group of elders have termed the endorsement undemocratic.Sources indicate that the elders have cleared three gubernatorial candidates (Noor and two others). Another meeting is planned for discussion on the new developments, said an elder privy to the information.Read: Garre elders bar Roba, Kerrow and four MPs from vying next yearOnly last week, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission summoned the long serving provincial administrator for grilling over his dealings with the NYS millions. Noor is wanted by the commission to clarify issues over procurement of consultancy services at the ministry, Yassin Amaro, EACC spokesman said.He was the chairman of the ministerial tender committee when the NYS scandal was unearthed and his role was to approve tenders and services awarded by the ministry.The anti-graft agency also wants the former powerful Provincial Commissioner to explain how he handled a sensitization programme to enable women and youth access of 30 per cent of government tenders.Roba has since conducted a series of meetings in the county with supporters urging him to defy the elders and run for a second term due to his development record.The elders verdict also affects five MPs and 18 ward representatives in the border county. Senator Billow Kerrow has however agreed to abide by the elders decision.Endorsement by elders in North Eastern is a critical aspect of negotiated democracy and though many politicians among them incumbents say the move infringes on the rights of voters, it's a plus for those cleared.
