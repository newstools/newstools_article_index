Kenyans have won nine of the 21 CNN Multichoice African Journalist of the Year awards, including this year, raising the question: Are Kenyans the undisputed best journalists in the continent?Asha Mwilu ( 1 ) and Rashid Idi ( 5 ) of KTN once again made the country proud when they bagged the 2016 overall award for their investigative documentary about the security intrigues at the Kenya-Somali border in Mandera county.Terror Crossing was found by the judges to be a high impact story told in the wake of Kenya s plans to build a wall on her border with Somalia .The story was aired by KTN in its investigative programme The Lead . It was recognised at a gala event held on Saturday night in South Africa.Joseph Mathenge ( 4 ) won the award in 2014 for his photos that captured the terror attack at Westgate Mall the previous year. Kenya also bagged the award in 2012 with a story by Tom Mboya ( 6 ) and Evanson Nyaga of The African Tribe in India , a TV documentary about Black people in the heart of India who trace their heritage to Africa.The Star s Fatuma Noor won the award in 2011 with her story about al Shabaab s network in Kenya and Somalia. Other winners are John Allan Namu ( 3 ), ( 2009 ), Angelo Kinyua ( 2005 ), Peter Murimi ( 2004 ), Wanja Njuguna who tied with a South African ( 2000 ) and Ken Opala ( 1996 ).South Africans have won the award five times, Nigerians three times, Zimbabweans twice while Burkina Faso, Uganda and Ghana have each won once.So what is the winning formula?Nancy Booker, a veteran journalism teacher with Multimedia University said: They submit stories that go beyond everyday reporting to reflect the challenges that people in society go through every day. Real stories touching on real issues affected real people. Unfortunately we don t get too many of those because they are time consuming and expensive for most media houses to sustain, she said.Rufus Chege believes Kenyan journalists know what judges look for, enter stories that affect ordinary rural folk, take angles that are universally resonating and are lucky. Media houses can sustain this. I believe most journalists want it easy, covering who said what stories. A few go the extra mile, establish contacts with development agencies and nose out for pain points , get it right and win awards, Chege said.
