Squatters encroaching on private land could legally own it if Parliament adopts a motion compelling the government to compensate the owners for the loss.Embakasi South MP Irshad Sumra said giving squatters in slums land ownership certificates will create confidence in investors for sustainable development. This House urges the national government to settle squatters and compensate private land owners either financially or through the provision of alternative land, the motion says.It is awaiting debate when MPs resume sittings next week. Sumra says slumdwellers, particularly in Nairobi, are faced with dire problems, including housing and sanitation, fires and congestion.Sumra says title deeds should be given to squatters in Mukuru kwa Njenga, Mukuru kwa Reuben, Kibera, Maili Saba, Mathare, Mukuru Kayaba, Chokaa, Quarry, Soweto, Utawala and Sinai slums.
