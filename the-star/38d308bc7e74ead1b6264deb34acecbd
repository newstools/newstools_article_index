She said some of them had cleared their bills, but others failed to, leading to an argument. They got drunk and danced and when the time to pay the bills came, some refused. On being forced to do so, a fight broke, Wanjiru said.Area police boss Samson Munyao said they are looking for the youths who fled after the incident. We have launched a manhunt for the boys, he said.Meanwhile, an acute water shortage continues in Maella village for the third week.
