A major political rift has opened among ODM members in Kilifi over the Malindi MP seat.The rift emerged when woman representative Aisha Jumwa said she will vie against incumbent Willy Mtengo. Jumwa broke ranks with Mtengo after the March 7 by-election after Dan Kazungu was appointed CS.On Monday, Mtengo and a delegation visited Governor Amason Kingi to discuss development, but the meeting turned political. Senator Stewart Madzayo said he will support Mtengo. Mtengo and Kingi are my brothers. I cannot betray Mtengo because he has done nothing wrong. I urge Malindi people to give him space to work, he said.Jumwa said she would announce the candidate she will support for senator because Madzayo will not be senator . The senator has his democratic right to choose who he will support, but he has no vote in Malindi. I am directly linked to Malindi, she said.Jumwa said she will support Kingi s re-election bid and campaign for Raila Odinga to be president. Both Mtengo and Jumwa are loyal to Kingi and Raila.Kingi said Malindi is a key area in ODM politics as it is the only constituency that voted six-piece in all the seats. He urged ODM aspirants for the MP seat to remain in the party.
