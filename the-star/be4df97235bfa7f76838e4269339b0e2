ODM leader Raila Odinga on Thursday took his political fight to Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya s doorstep, criticising him for joining Jubilee.He said governors joining the government in the guise of development do not have devolution at heart and are bend on ruining it.Raila told a mammoth crowd in Kinango he assured Mvuya of an ODM ticket recently after pleading with him, but he decided to quit. How can a governor purport to be joining the government for the sake of development, when they are controlling billions of shillings in their counties? Raila said.He said Jubilee has opened an "auction shop, where they are buying leaders".Raila was accompanied by Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu, Senators Agnes Zani (nominated) and Boy Juma Boy (Kwale).Others were MPs Jones Mulolwa (Voi), Omar Mwinyi (Changamwe).
