He said they were working with criminals."We are still wondering how thugs can get into a petrol station that is barely less than a km from a police station and murder three guards without police arresting them," he said.The Webuye West MP aspirant further said police were lax, and only harass brewers of illicit alcohol as they have forgotten to deal with "real insecurity"."There has been an increase in insecurity with some nincidents happening in broad day light," he said.Bungoma East CID boss Paul Mumo asked residents to give police information that could lead to the arrest of suspects.
