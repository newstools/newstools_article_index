Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen on Friday stormed out of a prayer meeting that turned into a charged political rally in Marakwet.The meeting was organised by local churches in collaboration with the county government. Murkomen flew to the venue accompanied by MPs Jackson Kiptanui (Keiyo South) and William Kisang (Marakwet West).On arrival, Murkomen was welcomed by speeches of angry residents who told him to his face he has failed to use his influential position in government to end insecurity in the Kerio Valley.Earlier, hundreds of residents from all four subcounties, led by Governor Alex Tolgos and former IG David Kimaiyo, marched along the Tot-Liter road to protest against runaway crime. They travelled in 10 buses to the valley to the prayer-cum-political rally.Resident Cheserek Moinoi told Murkomen they will support the opposition if the government will not end crimes swiftly. Women and children live in caves along snake-infested escarpments, yet we claim to be in government, Moinoi said. He said Marakwet elders will seek audience with President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, because area lawmakers, led by Murkomen, have failed to seek their intervention.Murkomen interrupted the programme as MCAs lined up to speak and announced Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and IG Joseph Boinnet will visit the area on October 14 to resolve insecurity. I was told this was a prayer meeting. I didn t know it would be a meeting to discuss Murkomen, he said as he left the venue. Moiben Kuserwo MCA William Chesingany said Murkomen was an unapproachable senator, owing to his frequent flights and failure to meet residents. It s better to suffer in the opposition than to suffer in government, Endo MCA Festus Kirop said. Tolgos appealed to CS Nkaissery to offer a lasting solution to banditry. I m asking Nkaissery to resolve insecurity as expeditiously as he ordered me to record a statement over Moi University VC appointment remarks, he said.
