I was idly browsing the Internet, looking at various sites where Kenyans air their grievances, many of which include relationship matters. One writer related her story of how, after being pestered by a male suitor, she finally relented and went out with him. THE JILTED LOVERThe night did not end very well for her. After she refused his advances, he pushed her out of his car and left her in the middle of nowhere. Another lady commented on the issue with a similar topic of how she was left en route to Nairobi from Thika at 3am in the morning.What really shocked me, however, is the fact that many Kenyans agreed with the man s actions, with some men even boasting of having done the same thing and would do it again if given the chance. SEX AS A CURRENCY Ladies were in on it as well, advising the lady that if she was not going to give it out , she should not have accepted the date. One lady even went as far as to say Upus, ukipelekwa out jua vitu upeane. (Nonsense, if you are taken out, know things must be given out).Another referred to sex as a currency availed to women and should be put to good use.I personally had to bail out a friend who was stuck in a Naivasha hotel, having to pay the bill after the man she was with walked out on her after she refused to accompany him to a room upstairs. True, she should not have put herself in such a situation, but luckily, she was safe and returned home in one piece.Therefore, this begs the question: is a woman supposed to prepare herself for intimacy whenever she goes out on a date? Has it become a prerequisite? Or should we just go ready to foot our own bills so as not to have to pay back the man? Madness, I tell you!
