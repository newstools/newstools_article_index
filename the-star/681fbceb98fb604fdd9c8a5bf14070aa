The Kenya Film and Classification Board and police are investigating the soaring cases of bestiality, filming of pornography and the rise in the number of strip clubs in Mombasa.CEO Ezekiel Mutua (pictured) said a report on strip clubs and bestiality will be ready by Thursday. He said girls are paid peanuts to entertain revellers by having sex with dogs, while some are also filmed committing such acts.Bestiality is being promoted by foreigners, the KFCB boss told the press on Sunday in Mombasa. Once we catch them, they will know there is a government in this country, Mutua added.He said the government will not allow such activities. Let them go and do it where there is no law or where such kind of activity is permitted. In Kenya, sex with animals or against the order of nature will not happen, Mutua said.He said such filmmakers can make noise until the cows come home but the board will not permit them to film such activities. There is not going to be film promoting radicalisation, pornography or bestiality in this country, Mutua said.He said the Board does not implement its own zealot or religious belief but will follow the law to challenge the acts. The level of immorality has come to a point where foreigners are getting exclusive villas to shoot pornographic videos, the KFCB boss said.He said villas have been raided and culprits arrested. The CEO said he has met the county commissioner and police bosses and they have agreed to arrest people in such business.In 2013, eleven women were arrested for having sex with a German shepherd in Nyali, Mombasa county. A foreign tourist was arrested for filming them.
