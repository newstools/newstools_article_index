The Mandera revenue collection department has come up with measures to increase revenue. The department will decentralise revenue collection in all the six subcounties.Director Samoa Dakane said the department has streamlined revenue collection down to the villages. He spoke at a forum in Mandera town on Thursday. We are reaching livestock markets, slaughterhouses, market stalls and bus parks to have a sound revenue collection base, he said. Dakane said money raised will finish stalled projects like street lights, roads and agriculture. The director said revenue collection clerks have been trained to improve delivery. The department has introduced public and private partnerships to include everybody in generating revenue for the county, Dakane said.
