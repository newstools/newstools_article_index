Former National Assembly Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim was allegedly captured on video exchanging blows with Somali s former Telecommunications Minister Mohamed Mursa at a Nairobi hotel.While it has not been established what might have transpired between the two, in the CCTV video Maalim is seen slapping the minister on both cheeks before resorting to heavy blows and punches.It is alleged that the two differed on political matters.Customers and security personnel at the Nairobi s Serena Hotel were forced to intervene and separate the two.Mursa was escorted out of the hotel, and Maalim also went in the same direction shortly after.It is unclear whether the two continued fighting after getting outside the hotel as the CCTV cameras failed to capture this.But Mursa is said to have reported the matter at the Kileleshwa police station.Kilimani OCPD Peter Katam told the Star the matter was being looked into.He said preliminary investigations indicated the two resorted to fighting after disagreeing on political matters.Kattam said they were currently analysing statements by witnesses, which will be compared with the CCTV footage and take appropriate action will be taken.He said a comprehensive statement as to what happened will be issued on conclusion of the analysis.But Nairobi police boss Japheth Koome said the matter would be handled by Diplomatic police as it involves Somali s ex-minister."Such matters involving top government officials from other countries can only be handled diplomatically," he said.Efforts to reach Maalim to comment on the matter were futile as his calls went unanswered.But sources said Maalim was not in a position to discuss the matter as it would be handled by community elders."We do not intend to pursue the matter legally, I am not at liberty to discuss the matter as community elders will look for an amicable solution," Maalim told one of the dailies.The sources also confirmed that no one was injured in the fracas.Maalim, who is vying for Garissa Town MP was recently endorsed by the opposition to battle it out in the 2017 elections for Garissa Town MP who current representative is majority leader Aden Duale.
