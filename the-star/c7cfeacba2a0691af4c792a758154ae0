Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has said leaders who engage in what he calls parrot talk are less development-oriented than quiet leaders. A good leader is the one who does his or her work quietly without attracting much attention. Those who talk too much do little, he said.Speaking during a fundraiser at St Joseph s Musokoto Secondary School in Nambale subcounty, the governor said his government aims to empower the people. Ojaamong said he will ensure more development projects are launched. My government has helped fund the construction of Nambale University and many other institutions across the county. We shall continue supporting education, he said.Ojaamong praised Nambale MP John Bunyasi for playing a pivotal role in developing the county. Bunyasi does his work with precision. If there is a problem with roads he consults my CEC. He does the same in health matters. These are the leaders we want. The Teso South MP does the same, Ojamoong said.Roads executive Bernard Waite said 1,600km of county roads are in good condition, adding class A, B and C roads are under the national government.
