Kenya is one of the countries in Africa with a high digital literacy, especially among the youth, but on the flipside it also has one of the highest unemployment rates on the continent.According to ICT CS Joe Mucheru, outsourcing currently provides one of the main job opportunities globally.Companies are no longer employing staff for jobs they can outsource and most of these jobs he says can be done online from the comfort of your home. This country, he says, can create a million digital jobs annually.Kenyans obsession with having to report to an office each morning for assignments must change if we are to cut unemployment.As Mucheru rightly puts it, Kenya must strive to train the youth to become digital workers.We commend the government s plans to establish (for a start) at least five innovation centres in every constituency. The primary school digital literacy programme will lay a solid foundation for the youth, especially in disadvantaged rural schools.
