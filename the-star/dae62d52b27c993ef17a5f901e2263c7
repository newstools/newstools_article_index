Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony has warned the Kikuyu community against reneging on its promise to support Deputy President William Ruto in 2022.He said the Kalenjin community banks on Mt Kenya to ensure Ruto becomes president.Speaking at St Theresa Catholic Church, Mogogosiek, in Konoin on Sunday, Chepkwony said the Kalenjins will fully support President Uhuru Kenyatta next year. We are now fully in Jubilee [Party] and behind Uhuru and Ruto. But in 2022, as per our agreement, we will want Mt Kenya to reciprocate the gesture by backing us. We have no doubt they will do it, he said.Chepkwony warned the region that if it does not give back by supporting the DP, such will be met with serious repercussions.The governor said they have fully supported Uhuru since 2013, and it would be sad if Mt Kenya does not fulfil its promise to back Ruto by endorsing another candidate.No automatic presidentSome Mt Kenya leaders have said Ruto will not automatically be the next president after Uhuru.Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and nominated Senator Paul Njoroge have openly said the DP should not expect automatic support.Their remarks have been dismissed by several Mt Kenya leaders. Konoin MP Sammy Koech urged the Kalenjin community to respect the DP as their de facto leader, just like other communities, and stop fighting him.He said Ruto s success will only be achieved if the region ignores unnecessary negative attacks on his personality.Koech said the region is fully in the Jubilee Party, contrary to claims that it has joined Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto s Chama Cha Mashinani. The governor is Ruto s ally turned critic.
