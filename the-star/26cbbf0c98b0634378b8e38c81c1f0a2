Alas, it is that time of the season where we look forward to our favourite shows coming back on screen. But this TV season, there is a great variety of shows that will premier. Here s a pick of what I anticipate will be the top new shows:1. Bull. Bull is a drama series about a psychologist who is great at reading the jury. The show is inspired by the early career of the famous Dr Phil and it stars Michael Weatherly (NCIS).2. Designated Survivor. The show stars Kiefer Sutherland ( 24 ) as a Cabinet member who, against the odds, becomes President after an attack on the capital. 3. Pitch. This show stars Kylie Bunbury as Ginny Baker, the first female to make pitcher in a major league baseball team.
