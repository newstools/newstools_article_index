In May 2012, Justice David Kenani Maraga stunned Kenyans when he stood before TV cameras and swore by the Bible that he has never taken and would never take a bribe.No one expected it, not even the members of the Judges and Magistrates Vetting Board who were about to vet him. The judge said he felt offended by accusations of bribery levelled against him. And by using the Bible, the judge reasoned, was the best way to express his innocence.That the 64-year-old Court of Appeal judge is a staunch Seventh Day Adventist is no secret. In fact, he flatly told the Judicial Service Commission panel that he was not ready to sit on Saturday, to hear a case, when he becomes the next Chief Justice. The judge listed himself as a member of the Constitutional Review Task Force of the Seventh Day Adventist Church East Africa Union.Maraga, the presiding Judge of the Court of Appeal in Kisumu, commands wide respect among clerics, his colleagues in the judiciary, and senior government officials.The judge was appointed to the High Court in October 2003 and elevated to the Court of Appeal in 2011. He holds an LL.B and an LL.M from the University of Nairobi.After receiving his law degree from the University of Nairobi in 1977, and a post-graduate diploma from the Kenya School of Law the following year, Justice Maraga opened a law firm in Nakuru where he practiced until he was appointed a High Court judge in 2003.Upon his appointment, Maraga was posted to the High Court in Mombasa before he was transferred to Nakuru, where he was the presiding judge for two years. He was later moved to Nairobi and posted to the Constitutional Review Division and later became the head of the Family Division.Many had tipped him to succeed Justice Willy Mutunga as the Chief Justice and the President of the Supreme Court.Fellow judges describe him as a likeable person, fiercely independent and an unapologetic stickler to the rule of law. They also say he is thoroughly reflective and devoid of ethnic god-fatherism.Justice Maraga contested for the position of Court of Appeal President against the current holder, Paul Kihara, and lost by a single vote.Last year, Justice Maraga sprung into the national limelight following his well-argued individual judgement in favour of indigenous media owners during the controversial appeal case on digital migration.He is also the chairman of the Judiciary Elections Petitions Committee, which has been widely commended for providing steady leadership and offering a sterling performance by fully abiding by and meeting all the constitutional stipulations and timelines.During his vetting, the most serious complaint against him was that he had been bribed to rule in a case, that provisions in the Valuation for Rating Act 48 were unconstitutional, while ruling in another matter that the Nakuru City Council s valuation roll was valid.Although no one claimed to have seen the judge solicit or receive the bribe, the board said the complaint emanated from a political aspirant in Nakuru, who claimed he brokered a deal with the judge. Few details were offered, the board, noted and ruled that there was no reason to doubt the judge s integrity.A second complaint concerned a criminal case in which a policeman killed a female colleague and an MP-elect. The judge found Andrew Moeche guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to 10 years in prison.The former Eldoret traffic policeman had been charged with the murder of Ainamoi MP David Kimutai Too and his companion, Eunice Chepkwony. The court later established that Eunice was Moeche s lover.Critics accused the judge of being too lenient on the accused person because of his tribe.But the board said there was no evidence of any unfairness or improper motive on the part of the judge.The Vetting Board commended his record of public service. They noted that while serving as a judge in Nakuru, Maraga was instrumental in setting up a programme and obtaining funds for training chiefs and village elders as the first persons to whom crimes would be reported, and who would handle and preserve evidence, especially in sexual offences and domestic violence cases.It was also noted that he took many steps to decongest prisons and attended to complaints by prisoners.
