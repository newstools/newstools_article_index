Senators yesterday resolved that Auditor General Edward Ouko should carry out a special audit of all land and houses the county governments inherited from county councils.Speaking before the Senate s Committee on Public Accounts and Investment, senators Boni Khalwale (Kakamega) and Kennedy Mong are (Nyamira) said former councillors and mayors grabbed public land.They spoke to the committee when Kisii Governor James Ongwae was questioned over the 2013-14 audit queries. The land that was previously owned by the defunct local authorities and councils should be audited, in particular the counties of Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu. In Trans Nzoia the land that belonged to the Prisons Department is gone, Khalwale told the committee, chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong o at Parliament Buildings.The senators asked Ongwae why Sh1.8 million collected at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital was spent at source against the Public Finance Management Act 2012.Ongwae said his administration resorted to spending the cash at source as there were emergency needs to be addressed at the medical facility.
