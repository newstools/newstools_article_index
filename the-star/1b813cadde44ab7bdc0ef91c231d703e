The Murulle clan in Mandera town on Saturday held a historic inauguration ceremony of their leader Sultan Mohamud Khalif.The colourful ceremony was was presided over by the community elders and attended by several area leaders, including National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale.The sultan was recently appointed by a gathering of family members in Aresa, Mandera East, three months ago.Duale said there is need to preserve cultural practices, since they are a form of identity.He said elders, sultans and kings have an integral role to play in not only uniting their respective communities, but also showing them direction in various matters.The elders, who make most of the political decisions in the region, will among other things decide if the current leaders in the county government will be reelected next year.Among the things expected to be discussed, is the stand taken by Governor Ali Roba to defy his own clansmen, who early last month barred him from contesting for a second term.At the 2013 general elections, the Murule clan, who occupy most of the region along the common border with Somalia, were given the deputy governor seat to support the majority Garre in clinching the governor's position.Voters in the area, especially the youth, have defied the elders decision on having a new breed of leaders next year.
