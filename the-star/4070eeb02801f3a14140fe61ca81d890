Turkana elders in Laikipia want the national government to expedite the issuance of identity cards to the community.In a petition filed in the National Assembly, the residents, through Turkana North MP Christopher Nakuleu, want the government to stop the biased vetting process . The Constitution prohibits all forms of direct or indirect discrimination against members of any community, the petition says.The petitioners want Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery to revoke any order directing the tedious vetting by the offices responsible for registration of persons in the county.

The committee is yet to visit Laikipia to investigate the issue.The county is inhabited by the Samburu, Maasai, Pokot, Kikuyu, Kalenjin, Somali, Borana and Meru.
