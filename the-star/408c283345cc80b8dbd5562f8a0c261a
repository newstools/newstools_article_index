 They need to swallow their pride, identify one party and spearhead one community Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka has urged three Western leaders to put their political differences aside and unite for the sake of Luhya community.They are Moses Wetang ula (Ford Kenya), ANC s Musalia Mudavadi and Cyrus Jirongo of United Democratic Party. Lusaka said the Luhya are united and live as friends, but they get divided by political leaders who seek political supremacy. We have Luhya from diverse subtribes living together in Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Kakamega, Vihiga and Busia. They have never differed along tribal lines. But when it comes to political leadership, we claim the community is not united, Lusaka said.He said it is the leaders who seek selfish gain. Lusaka spoke at a funeral in Lubanga village, Matungu, on Saturday. He urged the three leaders seeking the presidency to shelve their ambitions and settle on one candidate. They need to swallow their pride, identify one party and agree to spearhead one community to the presidency, Lusaka said. ODM national youth leader Rashid Mohammed said plans are underway to have one candidate carry the community s flag in the race for the top seat. He said the community requires bargaining power because it is difficult for the community to reap political gains when its leaders remain divided.(+) Leaders risk splitting the voteVihiga Senator has asked Western presidential hopefuls to first unite the community.
