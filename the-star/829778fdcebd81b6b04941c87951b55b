Five Kakamega MPs who joined Jubilee Party have warned Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi against soiling their names in his rallies.They said it was Mudavadi who negotiated for Jubilee to work with UDF before he gave up the outfit to form Amani National Coalition.The group led by Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali said the politician had no right to remove them from government."[Mudavadi] took us into a new marriage with Jubilee and we are comfortable. He should not ask us to change our nuptials to seek a new spouse," said "Why is he opposed to our working with Jubilee when he is working with Cord?" They said the ultimatum given by Amani was an insult to the MPs and the electorate.Read: We will form 'super alliance' with Cord to defeat Jubilee - MudavadiWashiali further accused Mudavadi of relying on assistance from other quarters to make a name for himself."He has failed to stand alone and sell his name. That is why he is confusedly siding with Cord in his effort to remain relevant," he said.Read: Mudavadi 'ready to be Cord flagbearer' in 2017 presidential raceThe MP noted he supported Mudavadi's bid for the presidency in 2013 and helped him garner votes from his constituency."I got 18,000 votes while Mudavadi got 8,000. Were it not for my efforts, he would not have received those votes from my constituency," he said."Mudavadi should be explaining to the people who voted for him why he led us to Jubilee and left us there."Washiali asked the Amani leader to apologise to the Luhya community and leaders who stood with him in the last election, when he signed an MoU with President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto.He noted the cordial working relationship with Jubilee has seen Mumias Sugar Company receive Sh3 billion from the government.He also said several roads in the area have been earmarked for tarmacking and that a technical training institute has been set up in Mumias East.Washiali was with MPs Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), Ayub Savula (Lugari) and Malulu Injendi (Malava).Read: Mudavadi: How Uhuru, Ruto duped me in 2012Also read: What the emerging cracks in both political coalitions mean
