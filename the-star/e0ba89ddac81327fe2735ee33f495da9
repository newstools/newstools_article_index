Release free education funds in seven days or prepare for a sit-in at TSC offices, the government has been told. Bungoma East Knut secretary Aggrey Namisi said head teachers have a hard time running schools for lack of cash. We want this money released immediately so schools pay subordinate staff. Otherwise, we will mobilise them to camp at the Teachers Service Commission to demand salaries, he said. Namisi spoke on Friday at Sitikho, Webuye West, during the farewell party for senior chief Julius Masibo. He accused Education CS Fred Matiang i of neglecting his responsibility to ensure school operations run smoothly. Namisi said supervisors and invigilators of last year s KCPE and KCSE exams have not been paid.
