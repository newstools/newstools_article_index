Raila Odinga's wish is to end historical land injustices meted out on Maasai's in Kajiado and Narok by colonial and subsequent independent regimes.Rosemary, the Cord leader's daughter said this on Saturday, adding he shared a lot on the tribulations of the Massai with the late William Ntimama, who was community chairman.She said Raila's wish was to unite the Maasai against those frustrating them. I stand before you today to bring you this message from my father who loves you very much," she said in Kapiti."It is out of that love that the Kajiado Maasai gave me the name Naserian and I am proud of it. My name is Rosemary Naserian Odinga."Rosemary spoke during the launch of George Kimiti s bid for the Kajiado East MP seat on an ODM ticket in 2017.She asked Maasai's to join the party under the opposition Cord coalition for their grievances to be rightfully addressed. I was once told by a Maasai elder that when it rains in Maasailand, men do not sleep in their houses but spend the night protecting their livestock from imminent attacks by marauding hyenas," said Rosemary."I want you to protect what is rightfully yours by refusing to sleep. Register in large numbers and use your votes to elect upright leaders."She noted she will always support her father in uniting the Maasai, to follow in Ntimama's footsteps.Read: Give Maasais jobs or else, MPs tell JubileeAlso read: We will support Jubilee in 2017, Maasai leaders tell UhuruKimiti, who will vie against incumbent Peris Tobiko, said he settled on ODM after many consultative meetings with local elders and Kajiado East youth.
