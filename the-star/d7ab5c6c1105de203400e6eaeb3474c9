The Institute of Certified Public Accounts Kenya wants the national government to write off debts inherited from the defunct county councils. National chairman Fernandes Baraza said some debts cannot be accounted for.In a speech read by training manager Wanjala Makhokha (pictured) in Kisumu yesterday, he said some suppliers were awarded contracts without proper documents during the transition period. It is therefore inequitable for the burden of such balances to be wholly inherited by the county governments, Baraza said.He said if the national and county governments are unable to reconcile their debts, they should agree on how to manage them. Baraza said this can be done through proper audit.He said Kenyans do not have information about government assets, their value, depreciation charges and impairment losses. He spoke during Icpak s second assets conference.
