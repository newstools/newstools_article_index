Year after year, the plains zebra faithfully return to the Nairobi Park to seek fine pasture. In recent years, this feat is becoming more and more challenging with the pressures of human encroachment, as the migration routes to and from the park are throttled into a narrow corridor. So it is again amazing that they returned in such numbers this year, totalling quite a few thousand.It has always been a favourite habit of mine to approach a herd of zebra, slowly idle and edge the vehicle closer until virtually in the middle of the herd, and then switch off the vehicle and observe them. Interestingly, they all have a unique marking pattern with no zebra being the same, much the same as a human fingerprint. Zebra can be very aggressive and have vicious fights for dominance.Various attempts have been made to tame zebras in the role of horses or donkeys but with very limited success, so they have been best left with their natural role in game parks.There are two sub-genus of zebra. There are five subspecies across Africa in the genus Hippotigris, of which the plains zebra is a part of, plus two sub-species of mountian zebra found in southern Africa. The name zebra comes from the old Portuguese word Zevra , meaning wild ass , and in Kiwahili, they are known as Punda Milia. They are quite observant and very sensitive regarding predator awareness. I have seen many encounters with lions by just sitting still with the herd. Try it some day, just remember to bring the basics, like binoculars and a camera.
