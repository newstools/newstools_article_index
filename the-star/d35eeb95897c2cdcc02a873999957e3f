The minibus that killed four people and injured six others in a road accident on Lang ata Road on Sunday was operating without licence, the NTSA has said.NTSA director general Francis Mejja yesterday said the vehicle KCG 748M was operating under the Ongataline Sacco, despite withdrawal of its Road Service Licence by the agency.The director said the sacco is yet to produce the driver of the vehicle, who fled immediately after the accident.This came as students from the Multimedia University demonstrated (pictured) after one of their own died in the accident. The peaceful protest later turned chaotic and police fired live bullets. Speaking to the press in his office, Mejja said the NTSA has resolved to deregister the sacco.He said the sacco s crew has become notorious and have not complied with the PSV rules, leading to multiple fatal accidents.Mejja said the authority had engaged the sacco officials on several occasions since March, but they failed to control their drivers. The decision to deregister the company was arrived at following a chronology of engagement between the authority and the company, he said.Mejja said a warning letter was sent to the company on March 3. The final warning meant any violation of traffic laws would lead to cancellation of their licence. As part of their response, the company admitted its inability to control the vehicles it operates, he said.Mejja said it became clear the management of this company has failed to manage the company s operations.
