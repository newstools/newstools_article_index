The title will be on the line this afternoon after seven months of action as curtains come down on the first edition of the SportPesa Super 8 Premier League with seven tantalising matches on the card. Defending champions TUK, Kayole Asubuhi and Jericho All Stars will be out for nothing but wins in their corresponding fixtures but only one of them will walk home with the league title and Sh1 million winners award. Leaders Asubuhi have their fate in their hands as they only need a win of any kind when they face underdogs Kiamaiko City for their final game of the season at Huruma grounds. The East conference bigwigs can t afford a slip up as a draw or a loss could completely extinguish their dreams of lifting the championship title which is within sight.With a more goal advantage, champions TUK have a tricky fixture against Metro Sports at Baba Dogo grounds and the students will be gunning for nothing less than a victory while praying that Asubuhi and Jericho slip-up.
