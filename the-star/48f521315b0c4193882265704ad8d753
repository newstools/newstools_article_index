The Sh38 billion Itare Dam continues to spark controversy among Bomet, Nakuru and Narok residents. The Italy-funded project has been marred by disputes, following claims that public participation was not carried out.Kipsigis elders say the project will divert water from the Mau Forest, causing rivers, such as Chemosit, Kipsonoi, Ndoinet and Sondu, to dry up. The elders said the project will lead to an ecological disaster.But Nakuru Deputy Governor Joseph Rutto has urged residents to calm down and stop threatening leaders. We advise all locals opposed to the project, the issues raised will be sorted out, he said. The Rift Valley Water Services Board has been on the ground sensitising people. Ruto was reacting to recent demonstrations by residents demanding compensation before the project is launched.
