Your political future is doomed, Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has told ODM defector Karachuonyo MP James Rege. We are telling our brother Rege that he has lost the track, hence, he must prepare for an end of his political career. We (Karachuonyo people) cannot allow Rege to walk freely after this serous betrayal. In fact it s an insult to us and entire Homa Bay county, he said.Rege defected to the Jubilee Party during it s launch on September 10. The legislator said he left ODM because it ignored his push for internal democracy. But Awiti said his exit was selfish and not for the benefit of the residents. He spoke on Sunday during a rally called Campaign against Rege for Joining Jubilee in Kendu Bay town, Karachuonyo.Calls to step asideAwiti was with Nyakach MP Aduma Owuor and six MCAs. The people of Karachuonyo are intact. Let no one be fooled that he has moved to Jubilee with anybody. We are here to close his political chapter in this constituency, Awiti said. Aduma, whose constituency neighbours Karachuonyo, said Rege has committed political suicide.He said he will present a petition seeking Rege s resignation. I assisted Rege during the 2013 elections but since he has dumped us, we won t allow him to let Jubilee make a foray into this area, Aduma said. The Political Parties Act is clear on this. Any leader who champions the policies of a party other than the one that sponsored them is deemed to have resigned. The MCAs said they do not recognise Rege as the area MP and called on him to seek a fresh mandate. You cannot be in two parties at the same time. Let Rege resign and a by-election be carried out, Kibiri MCA Kennedy Ondiek said. Homa Bay elders chairman Odak Mbaka warned political leaders against betraying the community for selfish interests.
