Is Water CS Eugene Wamalwa (pictured) considering withdrawing from the race for Nairobi governor? Our moles within his camp say twice now, his events have been disrupted and this has shaken the man described by his opponents as a doomed project . Wamalwa, who had teamed up with former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, has not been welcomed warmly by Mike Sonko supporters at two functions. The CS is concerned about ongoing propaganda that he never voted for Jubilee in 2013, after he failed to become Uhuru s running mate. The same is said of Wanjiru, who only moved to Jubilee after failing to win the senator seat on an ODM ticket at the last elections. *********** That Rachel Shebesh is preparing to defend her seat is a matter that is known only to a few. What Manzi wa Nai does not know is that some of the people supporting her bid are also stabbing her in the back by encouraging her opponents to run too.*********** A nominated Jubilee MP has become addicted to alcohol. The lady is drunk most of the day and when she is in Parliament. She spends most of her free time drinking and if the bar is closed, she resorts to drinking in her tinted-windows car. It is unclear why the legislator has been drinking so heavily. Those in the know believe there must be something very wrong with her.*********** The anti-defection law has sent shivers down the spines of many MPs. The law, which was passed by Parliament last week, appears to have been destined to end the political careers of a number of MPs, amid fears it was crafted to lock out perceived party rebels. Yesterday, despite the fact that MPs are enjoying their 30-day recess, some were within Parliament Buildings, where they were seen in groups discussing the effects of the law. Some were overheard complaining the 12th Parliament may see only about 20 per cent of its members re-elected. One MP told his colleagues this is precisely why their party leaders forced them to pass the law.********** A renowned and outspoken human rights activist is the talk of the town. Corridors has been told the man is alleged to have received Sh3 million from an NGO to work with an MP from Nakuru county to ensure they evict a Somali businessman from a piece of land. The businessman is in court and all land agencies have ruled that the land belongs to him since he is the fourth buyer. The MP, a former councillor, and the activist are said to have asked the businessman to give them two acres to stop fighting him. Corridors has learnt the unshaken businessman has vowed not to be intimidated. He wants to be compensated or allowed to build on the land. The MP is said to be among people who sold the public land to the first buyer, a private company. Many are wondering why the sudden change of heart. ************ Did the Judicial Service Commission fail to properly guide Justice Aaron Ringera on how to respond to questions during his vetting yesterday for the CJ post? Corridors is concerned that every time the former anti-graft czar responded to questions, he answered directly to those who had asked, instead of addressing the chairperson. Most of the time, the man who once said an anti-graft czar liveth between the hammer of his friends and the anvil of his opponents kept on using words such as madam and my brother . The commission chairperson did not bother to ensure protocol was observed.
