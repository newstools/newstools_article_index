About 400 schoolchildren die annually in road accidents, a report from the Traffic department shows. It says the majority of these accidents occur in urban areas. This means 2,000 children have died in the past five years.According to the report, 70 per cent of children walk to school. We cannot afford to continue losing children on the roads, Association for Safe International Road Travel executive director Brigitte Oywaya said.She spoke during the launch of the Action 2020 campaign for safe routes for schoolchildren. The campaigns come two years after Laisamis MP Joseph Lekuton tabled the Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2014 in Parliament, with the aim of ensuring road safety for children.The Bill proposes that school buses conform to safety standards. This is not a figure that has just been pulled out of the thin air. The existing 50kph is not protecting children, Oywaya said.
