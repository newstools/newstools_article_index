Lawyer Kethi Kilonzo yesterday got a reprieve after her trial on alleged theft of a voter registration card was temporarily stopped by the Court of Appeal.Kethi s trial was scheduled for a three-day hearing at the chief magistrate s court in Nairobi, but it was delayed indefinitely after she obtained the orders, a few hours before the hearing began.The prosecution had lined up three witnesses to testify against her, but the court was informed an order by the Court of Appeal had temporarily stopped the case. The Court of Appeal has upheld an application by Kethi and has ordered stay of proceedings in this trial Kethi s lawyer Fred Ojiambo said.He said the order will remain in force until her application is heard and determined. Ojiambo said he requires time to get a copy of the order so he can formally serve the prosecution.Prosecutor Mungai Warui said though he was ready to proceed with the hearing, he had no other option but to adjourn the case following the development.Kethi and IEBC official Godfrey Lempiso were charged in September 2013. The two have denied the charges. The case will now be mentioned on October 18.
