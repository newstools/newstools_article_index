Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery and IG Joseph Boinnet have been summoned over the torture and murder of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani and two others.The two officials are expected to appear before the National Assembly Security and Administration committee in two weeks.On Tuesday, commitee chairman Asman Kamama called on DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro and Boinnet to explain the occurrences that led to the death of Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and their driver Joseph Muiruri."Since 2016 started 71 people have been killed by police. Nobody is safe and we want investigations conducted as a matter of urgency. We demand Interior CS to form an inquiry committee to carry out investigations," Kamama said.He asked Administration Police to ensure they use firearms and observe the NPSC code of conduct, failure to which it will initiate the process of reverting APs to National Security department. The Deputy IG of APs must ensure his officers properly use firearms and observe NPSC or we will be forced to revert the officers back to the national government, he said.Four police officers linked to the death of the three have been detained to pave way for investigations.Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Chebulet, Leonard Maina Mwangi and Silvia Wanjiku appeared at the Milimani Law courts on Monday and have been detained for 14 days.The fourth officer, Leonard Mwangi, appeared before a magistrate's court on Tuesday and has been remanded for 13 days.During his appearance at the High Court, the DCI said that the FBI will assist in investigations.Kimani, Mwenda and Muiruri disappeared on June 23 after attending a matter in Mavoko law courts.They had attended a case in which Mwenda accused an AP officer of attempted murder, after the officer shot and injured him in April 2015.Their bodies were found on June 30 floating in Oldonyo Sabuk River.The deaths evoked countrywide protests on Monday by lawyers and more than 30 local and international rights organisations.The activists demanded government action over the "heinous" killings.Courts in various parts of the country also halted services in solidarity with protestersProtestors even manhandled police spokesman Charles Owino and forced him to join their march to the IG's offices.
