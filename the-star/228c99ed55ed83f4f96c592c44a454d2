A Marama Central ward hopeful has said the Kakamega government lacks programmes to identify, nurture and develop youth talent.Thomas Wanga said the county should not only concentrate on improving academics, but other skills as well. Some youth are not good in class but perform well in out-of-class activities, he said. Wanga spoke when he launched the Maseno Cup tournament at Shitsitswi Primary School on Saturday.He said a lot of money is allocated for sports development. But MCA Michael Keya dismissed the allegations, saying the county has sports programmes for the youth.
