The impeachment motion against Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero may not be debated, after all. A source at City Hall disclosed intrigues to frustrate and scuttle the bid in the assembly.The source said the first plan is to ensure the house has no quorum for all the three sittings this week. This is to ensure no business, including debating the motion, is transacted. We know the assembly cannot meet the threshold to impeach the governor, but we didn t want to take any chance. Remember, after debate, members will vote and this will be done through secret ballot. At that point you cannot trust anybody, the source said.This strategy worked on Tuesday, when the assembly suffered quorum hitches after all Cord and more than 20 Jubilee MCAs skipped the sitting.The Standing Orders state that a motion to impeach the governor be debated for three sittings. It is, however, silent on what happens if it appears on the order paper (business of the day) three consecutive sittings but is not debated.
