The Busia County Referral Hospital will get a new face with the necessary support, its new management has said. Power disconnections will be a thing of the past. All other contingencies, including drug shortage, will be settled at the press of the button, new medical superintendent David Mukabi (pictured) said.He took over from Dr Janerose Ambuchi in August. Mukabi said the Facility Improvement Fund will revert to health institutions in a week, giving them authority to incur expenses. The Health Fund Management Board has been constituted. We will hold our second meeting next Tuesday to study working plans developed by all health institutions in the county, approve them and request for money from Treasury.
