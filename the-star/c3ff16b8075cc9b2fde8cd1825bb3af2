The 2016 Miss Tourism Kakamega county Ivy Marani has not received her award, three months after she won the crown.She is now contemplating stepping down over what she refers to as frustration by the Tourism department.Marani has completed her degree course in journalism at Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology and is awaiting graduation. Signs of trouble during my reign began immediately after the 2016 Miss Tourism competitions at Golf Hotel when I was abandoned at the venue alone and I had to find my own way to my home in Amalemba estate, she told the Star in Kakamega yesterday.The Tourism queen says the county government has not facilitated her to run any programme. Despite my colleagues from other counties running programmes and receiving facilitation to tour several countries to market their counties, I have never been given my award and have not seen the Sh20,000 monthly stipend I am entitled to as Miss Tourism Kakamega, she said.Marani said she was abandoned at the academy in Nairobi during preparations for the national finals. I spent my own money for accommodation in the city and purchase of costumes... I incurred costs and to date the county has been reluctant to refund my money, Marani said.But Kakamega Tourism executive Elsie Muhanda said the county has no terms or reference with the Tourism queen. The county government was ready to skip this year s contest. We had no money and did not budget for this year s edition. But the organiser we procured last year offered to source for funds and organise the event on behalf of the county government, Muhanda said.Trans Path Limited organised the event last year.
