A delegation from the IAAF has called on Kenya to speed up preparations towards the 2017 World Under-18 Championships.The team of five was in the country for a series of meetings with the Local Organising Committee led by chairman Jack Tuwei and CEO Mwangi Muthee.The delegation was led by Emanuele Perotti-Nigra, Director of Technology and Information at the IAAF, and had members in Jan Zmek (AMS marketing), Ken Britland (Seiko), Daniel Hawkes (Canon) and Luca Sperotti (Deltatre).They are in the country to advise the LOC on various aspects of hosting the event including data handling, media/broadcast rights, timing and marketing.After a tour of Kasarani stadium, the host venue, Zmek said: We are hoping to build on the success of the 2007 World Cross Country Championships held in Mombasa. However, there is a lot of work to be done based on our assessment today. We wish to have a full stadium and hope there will be promotion to achieve this. We have faith that the event will be held in Kenya. There is enough time if priority is given to our event. He added: I am not happy as yet (with the preparations) but I hope it can be done, there is no other way. We must be ready for the more than 160 nations. Emanuele said: We are going to seek answers on when the demands and milestones set by the IAAF can be met. He added a lot must be done in terms on refurbishments at the stadium where data facilities must be installed afresh.Muthee reiterated on their commitment to host a successful event saying: We have guarantees from the highest office in the land and we must understand that the government procedures are slow but sure. Zmek observed that upon renovations, the stadium will be handed to the IAAF within seven days to the event, clear of any advertising.He added that after this the IAAF will bring their international sponsors while local sponsors will also be given their share of advertising space.
