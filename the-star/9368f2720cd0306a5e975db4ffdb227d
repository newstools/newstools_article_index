Two Kisumu County Assembly MCAs suspended last week over gross misconduct have said the decision was politically instigated.Masogo Nyangoma ward representative Samuel Ongou and his Wawidhi ward counterpart Moses Ochele were suspended for eight and 28 sittings respectively by the speaker Ann Adul.They accused the speaker of not respecting the law and for openly supporting one of Governor Jack Ranguma s opponents.The two were suspended last week on Wednesday after what the speaker termed as gross misconduct.They have been barred from the assembly and its precinct inclusive of committees and privileges.Speaker Adul said she took the action after disorderly conduct by the two civic leaders when the house was discussing a report on the alleged mismanagement of the Kisumu ward development fund.Read: Sh700m set aside for building Kisumu county assemblyShe said during the debate, a clerical officer was assaulted, the speaker was threatened with menace and documents forming the business of the day were violently ripped off the speaker s hands and shredded into pieces by the two. We have a rogue speaker who can make the assembly suspend members based on political reasons", Ongou said. We know very well that she has taken sides and what is surprising is the suspension of the budget chair Willis Ogonyo who is harmless and does not even speak much", Ochele said. Ochele said they are aware that this was done because the county government had already prepared a supplementary budget that is to be taken to the assembly to aid in payment of contractors. We know that they want the supplementary budget to flop so that they can stage manage demonstrations by contractors against Ranguma over delayed payments, he said.Ochele was suspended for disrespecting the chair, violently destroying the documents and property of assembly.Ongou was on the other hand suspended because of arrogant utterances, threatening the chair with menace, assaulting a clerical officer at the assembly, promoting warlike activities and creating fear amongst members.Also read: I will reclaim my post as Kisumu speaker, says Adul
