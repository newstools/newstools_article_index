The Kenya women s Under 23 volleyball team registered mixed results in build up matches against top clubs ahead of the Confederation of African Volleyball women s Under 23 Championships between October 23-27 at the Safaricom Indoor Arena, Kasarani.The Catharine Mabwi-coached side beat Nairobi Water on Tuesday, and fell to both national champions Kenya Pipeline and five-time Africa Club winners Prisons Kenya on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.The little Malkia Strikers outdid Water girls in straight sets in a duel that boosted the U-23 squad s spirits. Champions Kenya Pipeline humbled the age group lineup 3-0 (19-25, 22-25, 20-25) and Prisons beat the Mabwi squad twice with identical 3-1 set scores.Kenya Volleyball Federation s technical director David Lung aho is gratified with the impetus in the U-23 stable. He however noted the outfit needs to improve greatly. The team has now formed and the girls coordinate well in their formations. There are considerable gains in the team but also there is so much to be done in the remaining time. Thus far, I am pleased that our team can be placed in the upper cadre in the continent, observed Lung aho who also doubles up as the head coach of Kenya Prisons.The U-23 side faces Mt. Kenya University in their last buildup tie of the week today. We want the girls to get used to harder games hence we lined up the match against a men s team. They have to become accustomed to hard spikes, We must prepare the team to gallantly face an opponent of any kind of toughness, added the former Kenya international and Kenya Commercial Bank (men s volleyball club) setter.Elsewhere, two-time Kenyan volleyball Olympian (2000 Sydney and 2004 Athens) Roselidah Obunaga has turned into coaching after a successful playing career.
