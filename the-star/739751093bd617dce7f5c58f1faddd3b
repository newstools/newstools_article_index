Countries have an opportunity to end the mixed signals they send on the value of wildlife products, Prince William says. The Duke of Cambridge called for protection of endangered elephant and rhino. Speaking on Thursday at the Tusk s Time for Change event, at the Shard, London, Prince William said the CITES conference in Johannesburg is timely. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora conference in South Africa began on Saturday and will be concluded on October 5. Earlier this month the Great Elephant Census was published. And it confirmed what many of us have feared for some time one of our planet s most treasured species is on course for extinction at the hands of poachers and traffickers, he said. The Duke said one million elephants roamed Africa when he was born, but there were only about 350,000 last year.
