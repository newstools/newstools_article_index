MP hopeful Peterson Mitau will sponsor a bill in Parliament to ensure companies in Changamwe increase the number of their employees by 10 per cent.Mitau said the additional employees should all come from Changamwe constituency. Youth unemployment in Changamwe, he said, is at an all-time low yet the constituency hosts the most number of industries and companies, including the Mombasa port. He said it is useless to boast about being rich in industry yet the majority of youth are unemployed. I will make sure youth in Changamwe get the lion s share of opportunities whenever there are jobs in those factories and industries, including at the KPA, Mitau said. He blamed the lack of jobs on MP Omar Mwinyi, saying unemployment makes the constituency a breeding ground for criminals. Mwinyi has said he does not discriminate against Changamwe youth in ensuring there are jobs.
