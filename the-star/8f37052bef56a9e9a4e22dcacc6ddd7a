Chief Justice nominee David Maraga has hit the ground running, holding his first meeting to discuss election preparedness of the judiciary.Justice Maraga, who is the chairman of the Judiciary Election Committee, yesterday met the team at the Milimani law courts to discuss what needs to be put in place for the judiciary to be ready to handle petitions arising for the 2017 general election.This is his first meeting since he was nominated by the Judicial Service Commission on Thursday.Judge Maraga began the meeting at 6am and welcomed his nomination. He promised to be efficient in service delivery. Those in attendance were judges David Majanja, Smokin Wanjala, Kathurima M noti, Mohammed Ibrahim and Msagah Mbogholi.Others are Justice Stella Mutuku and magistrates Roselyne Oganyo, Peter Gesora and Lilian Arika.Maraga had said he would advocate for the extension of the time to hear a presidential petition from the current 14 days to 30 days to ensure judges have ample time to consider issues raised at length.In an earlier report, his team had also directed that the Supreme Court only handles the presidential election petition to avoid being overwhelmed. The Court of Appeal should act as final court in petitions for the post of governor, senator and MP. The petitions by MCA should end at the High Court, the report suggests.However, this recommendation was not implemented as the Supreme Court, under former CJ Willy Mutunga, admitted petitions from governors and MPs.
