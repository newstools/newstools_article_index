Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau and his Kandara counterpart Alice Wahome have broken their silence over the controversial Northern Collector Tunnel.The two said on Saturday that they fully support the project but asked the government to address the issues raised by experts and residents.They spoke a few days after governor Mwangi wa Iria accused local MPs of cowering from commenting on the issue because they did not want to take a stand. We want to hear them speaking in Parliament and in the Senate addressing any issues concerning the project instead of hiding, Wa Iria said.Read: Murang'a residents want area MPs to break silence on 'secret' water projectBoth legislators who were speaking separately said it would be wrong, however, for the government to ignore concerns raised against the project.The duo said it is vital for Murang a residents to see the benefits that have been promised by Athi Water Services Board as the tunnel is constructed.Jamleck sought to exonerate himself from claims that he was secretly fighting the project.Wa Iria had earlier in the week said that the county government is fully behind the project but would want the government to help improve water connectivity in the county.Also read: Raila using water project to gain political points, Wairia says, defends Jubilee He said he was in talks with the Water Cabinet Secretary to have the government supply water pipes worth Sh1 billion to enhance distribution of water in the county.Read: Murang'a tunnel safe, says Athi water board
