When the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee made its report into reform of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, it recommended that the IEBC be reconstituted by September 30.It is now September 12 and it is not even clear in most Kenyans minds whether the Bill that will create a panel to interview the new chairperson and commissioners is still with the legislators or has gone to the President for assent.While it is not realistically possible to install the new IEBC by the end of this month, it is now barely 11 months to the 12th general election. These timelines are worrying, given the lack of activity and preparedness.It is all very well to launch all manner of amalgamations in the political party sphere, but without an IEBC that is credible across the political divide all the leadership elite are doing is piling up near-future trouble. This is unacceptable. Kenyans need an electoral manager/referee that is above reproach and want it soon.
