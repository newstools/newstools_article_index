A police officer told a Mombasa court on Monday that 22 youths accused of being members of al Shabaab pledged allegiance to an organisation called Jihad Youth Group.Peter Mbua said he led 150 officers to Masjid Musa, Majengo, on February 2, 2014, to arrest the suspects. He said they found leaflets inviting the youth to a meeting. We had been informed of the meeting and that s why we responded swiftly, Mbua said. He said the first GSU officer to enter the mosque was fatally injured by the armed youth. The case continues on November 5.
