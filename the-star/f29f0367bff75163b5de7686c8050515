Picking Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho as your running mate will be disastrous for Cord leader Raila Odinga, Aden Duale has said.He said Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula stand a better chance to give Jubilee leaders a run for their money, because they have the numbers and influence on the voters. You are leaving Kalonzo with more than 1.5 million votes and Weta [Wetang'ula] with the Luhya massive following for Joho? You will fall and break your skull my friend, the National Assembly Majority leader and Garissa Township MP said.He said either of them should be Raila s deputy.Duale said it will be a big misstep for Raila to choose a deputy "who hardly commands more than 1.5 million votes"."Politics is about numbers, the one with the most carry the day, if the voting process is fair," he said..Duale thinks Raila is doing a minus calculation to consider the youthful Joho as part of his winning team.On Sunday in Mombasa, he said he predicts a straight win for Jubilee, because the opposition is making blunders day by day.Duale was reacting to remarks that Joho should deputised Raila.During ODM 10 at 10 celebrations in Kisumu, Governor Jack Ranguma, MP John Mbadi (Suba), Senator Anyang Nyong o (Kisumu) and woman representative Aisha Jumwa (Kilifi) said Joho fits the bill.
