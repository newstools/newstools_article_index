The National Treasury should release the Equalisation Fund cash to the marginalised counties, Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya says.The Meru Governor accused the National Treasury of deliberately withholding the funds to frustrate the counties. We will not allow anyone to hold devolution hostage. The Treasury should release these funds to the Northern Kenya counties as quickly as possible, Munya said.He said Wajir is a testimony that devolution is working.Munya spoke in Wajir on Saturday shortly after he launched publicity event the Devolution Torch in Wajir with his host Governor Ahmed Abdullahi.This event will give the public an opportunity to express their views on the gains of devolution and suggest areas of improvement.The Devolution Torch caravan is expected to go round all the counties.Abdullahi said Wajir made strides by prudently using the little resources it receives from the National Treasury. He urged the Treasury to release funds as most counties have now improved on their absorption capacity. With the little 15 per cent shared revenue received by the counties, citizens at the grassroots are feeling the gains of devolution and devolution is here to stay, Abdullahi said.
