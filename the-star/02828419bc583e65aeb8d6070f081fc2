Commonwealth Youth Games 3000m champion Davies Kiplagat is hoping to sign off his junior career on a positive note next year at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Kampala.Kiplagat who has been instrumental and vibrant in the junior cadre is targeting a world cross country title in Kampala. The season has not been bad but I have laid out my plans for next year.I am targeting to win the junior title at the world cross country in Kampala, Kiplagat said. I believe it is possible owing to the training schedule I will be embarking on, he added.The 18-year-old athlete bagged a silver medal in the 10,000m at the Africa junior Championships before winning a 3000m gold at the Africa Youth championships in Mauritius.Last year he placed second at the World Youth Games in Colombia over the same 3000m distance.He is set to compete in a 10km race next month in The Netherlands as part of his preparations. The cross country series are about to kick off and I will be using them in preparation for the world event, Kiplagat who comes from Sogowet in Kericho County said.He will miss the World U-18 championships in Nairobi where he could have upgraded his silver to a gold. I wish I could but unfortunately by that time I will be over 18 years old. However I am preparing to graduate to the seniors after the world cross next year, he said.Citing experience as salient in competing in the senior ranks, he said there has been a lot of improvement in his career. Each year I gain experience and when I graduate it will not be hard for me to adapt, he said.
