Mwingi Central MP Joe Mutambu has said he owns the Wiper party and wants it dissolved. I am surprised when I hear people calling us defectors and saying we should resign. We are not defectors because I own Wiper and all I want is to have it dissolved, he said.Mutambu defected to the Jubilee Party.He yesterday said he furnished the Nairobi office and pays the rent.Mutambu criticised members calling for defectors' resignations, saying it would subject citizens to unnecessary expenses. He spoke at St Paul s Catholic Church Matuu, Yatta constituency, on Sunday. Present were MPs Francis Mwangangi (Yatta) and Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni). We will not allow you to subject Kenyans to by-elections that will cost them billions of shillings because that will mean the price of unga and paraffin goes up, he said.Mutambu said politicians calling for defectors' resignation should fund by-elections. It is just the other day the same people were calling for the disbandment of the IEBC and now Kenyans have to pay for their exit. Now they want the same Kenyans to foot the bill for by-elections for almost 60 MPs, seven governors, six senators and about 100 MCAs. This is unacceptable, he said.Mutambu gave Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka 30 days to call a leaders' meeting to chart a political direction for the community or face unspecified action.
