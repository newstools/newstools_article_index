Kenyans above 65 years could benefit from free NHIF medical cover if Parliament adopts a motion compelling the government to provide the services. Gichugu MP Njogu Barua (pictured) says the group, estimated at 1.39 million, is more susceptible to disease and disability. But the majority of them do not benefit from the government s monthly welfare programme for the aged, he said. This House urges the government to provide NHIF cover to all Kenyans aged 65 years and above to reduce the heavy burden on families, increase the productivity of Kenyans, ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for Kenyans of all ages in line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, the motion says. DP William Ruto in August said the government will ensure people aged 65 years and above access free NHIF cover.
