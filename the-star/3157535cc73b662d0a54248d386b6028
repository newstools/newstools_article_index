Motorcycle operators should brace themselves for tougher times after the National Transport and Safety Authority launched new traffic regulations.Speaking in Naivasha during the announcement of the regulations on Tuesday, NTSA director general Francis Meja said the authority will ensure the rules are strictly adhered to.A rider should not carry more than one traveller riding pillion. They must put on helmets and reflector jackets. It is also illegal to carry a traveller and a load at the same time.Only children aged 12 and below can be carried together with an adult provided the child is seated between the rider and the adult and wears a helmet designed for them. As of Tuesday morning, we had lost 338 motorcycle operators in road accidents since the start of the year. This figure is worrying, Meja said.Many accident and emergency wards across the country are full of road accident victims. Meja said motorcycle operators contribute to 20 per cent of fatal accidents. The rules provide that no motorcycle will be sold or transferred without two helmets and two reflective jackets. Women are barred from seating sideways. The rules state the passenger must rest his or her foot on the footrests. Every motorcycle rider must ensure that a passenger sits astride the motorcycle, the rule reads. Only the disabled are exempted. Riders must ensure their headlights are on at all times when riding. Those carrying loads are required to ensure no part of the load drags on the road, which is common especially when ferrying construction metal bars. Riders licenced to carry passengers must have their helmets painted yellow and be members of a sacco. Those who contravene any provision of the regulations is liable to a fine not exceeding Sh20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.
