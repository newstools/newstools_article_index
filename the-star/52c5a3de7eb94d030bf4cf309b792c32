Residents yesterday petitioned the DPP to implement a Senate report and have Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi prosecuted for misusing Sh1 billion public funds.Under the Wajir Justice Forum lobby chaired by Mohamed Abikar, residents gave DPP Keriako Tobiko two weeks to act, otherwise they will sue.Abikar yesterday said if the DPP implements the report recommending Abdullahi s prosecution alongside that of the executive, he will be the first county head to be charged in court.The residents have accused Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission CEO Halakhe Waqo and his deputy Michael Mubea of delaying investigations.The agitations by WAJUF are based on a successful petition they filed against the governor at the Senate early this year.The report says, The committee finds the DPP should investigate and take necessary action against the governor and the county government officials for awarding contracts and tenders illegally. Abikar has moved to court to block the county s budget, saying residents were not consulted. The misappropriation was done through pilferage of resources three months upon the governor resuming office, Abikar said.
