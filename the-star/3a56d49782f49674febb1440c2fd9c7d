The nomination of Justice David Maraga as the country s next Chief Justice literally breathed life into an otherwise sleepy village in Nyamira county.Minutes after news the JSC picked him for the coveted and powerful position, residents of Bosose village burst into almost deafening ululation a Kisii traditional chant reserved for the community s heroes and heroines.The village thrust itself into headlines on Thursday afternoon, women leaped, jigged and hopped as elderly men pranced around to traditional lyrics and hymns belted out by the youth and choirs.Villagers walked into the packed rural home of the Appeal Court judge, and many could be seen supplicating in low tones and thanking God for the nomination.Maraga was recommended on Thursday, beating 10 other applicants for the CJ position.His name was forwarded to the President by the Judicial Service Commission and it will be forwarded to Parliament for vetting and approval.If approved, he will be formally appointed and sworn in to succeed retired Chief Justice Willy Mutunga.
