Countries attending the CITES meeting in South Africa on Sunday agreed to discuss recommendations for all nations not to allow commercial trade in raw and worked ivory.This paves way for a formal discussion on whether to list all African elephants in a category that would result on a total ban of international trade in ivory.Conservationists and countries like Kenya who have been pushing for this say a successful outcome would provide African elephants with the highest level of protection under international law.Fondation president Franz Weber said she witnessed a message to the world to urgently close domestic ivory markets. By largely agreeing to the proposal of the 29-nation African Elephant Coalition, it marks another turning point in CITES policy to prevent driving elephants into extinction, she said.CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, an international treaty drawn up in 1973 to protect wildlife against over-exploitation and to prevent international trade from threatening species with extinction.Some countries, particularly from southern Africa, oppose the ban and want to be allowed to continue trading in ivory.They say they have high elephant populations and they need to gradually reduce the numbers and profit from their ivory.The debate, which is expected to be explosive, was underway by the time of going to press.
