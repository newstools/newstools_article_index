Chief Justice nominee David Maraga has refuted claims by petitioners who do not want him selected to succeed Willy Mutunga.Maraga is being vetted by Parliament's Justice and Legal Affairs Committee amid three petitions challenging his selection.Petitioner Emmanuel Korir accused the judge of failing to uphold the constitution in his ruling in a case regarding the killing of the then Ainamoi MP David Too, on January 31, 2008.The parliamentary aspirant says that while serving at the Nakuru High Court, Maraga reduced the murder charge to manslaughter leading to a 10-year imprisonment.Read: Judge David Maraga nominated Chief JusticeAlso read: The Bible and the law: Nominated Chief Justice David Maraga in profileBut Maraga insisted his judgement in the case was not wrong."This was an unfortunate issue but as a judge I go to court and deal with cases based on evidence and the law," he said.He also said he could not recuse himself from the case simply because he came from the same ethnic group as the accused. "I could not just excuse myself because the accused was a Kisii like me. I was dealing with self-defence and provocation," he said."The person who filed the petition against me was not known to me personally. The only similarity is we come from same ethic group."Critics accused the judge of being too lenient on the accused person because of his tribe.Another petitioner, Fredrick Onyancha, asked Parliament to reject Maraga saying he was responsible for the gross backlog of cases in Eldoret.But Maraga said there was no backlog, adding "the case that the petitioner is complaining about was determined and closed".The public vetting is final hurdle between the 66-year-old and the coveted job.
