Family Bank have doubled prize money ahead of tomorrow s Eldoret Half Marathon.This time round, the winners in both categories are poised to take home Sh500,000 up from the Sh250,000 winning prize in the previous nine editions. Being the only road race in the North Rift at the moment before the November s Baringo Half Marathon, hundreds of athletes in the area are expected to battle out for the lucrative prizes.According to Family Bank head of marketing and corporate communications, Carole Gichuru, over 1000 athletes are expected for the race. We are really excited to hold this event that has continued to provide a platform for our young athletes to explore their talent, she said. Gichuru said the race has catapulted athletes to the European spring races after posting good times in the high altitude region. The race is recognised worldwide since it has conformed to Athletics Kenya standards and many have used the results here to enter major races abroad, she said.Olympic marathon champions Eliud Kipchoge (men) and Jemimah Sumgong (women) will grace the event. Uasin Gishu County AK chairman Charles Chesire said course results documentation will start in the 10th edition after the change of the starting and finishing point.The race, which used to end at Family Bank Eldoret main branch, will now end at Zion Mall. We have bettered the course and the finishing point will be different from the previous one. We will now start keeping records for the course, Chesire said. Last year s winners Sammy Kipkurui (men) and Caroline Chepchirchir (women) will defend their titles.
