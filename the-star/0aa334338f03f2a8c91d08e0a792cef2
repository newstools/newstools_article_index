Lamu residents have questioned why the assembly set aside Sh670,000 to buy coffins. They said the allocation is funny and suspicious .The county was allocated Sh2.6 billion this year. The residents said there is more to this issue than meets the eye. We Muslims don t need coffins. We demand to know why such a huge amount of money was set aside to buy coffins. Who will be killed? Why do MCAs keep playing with public funds like this? Do they think we are children that we won t find out their funny dealings? We want the governor to tell us what is happening, Ali Kassim said.Budget and Appropriations Committee chairman Omar Lali said the coffins are for non-Muslim county staff. He said the allocation was made in good faith and not intended to insinuate any bad luck for non-Muslims working in Lamu.
