Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyang wara wants Governor Evans Kidero impeached because the county s debt has risen to unmanageable levels since he took over office.The debt increased from Sh12 million when he took office in March 2013 to Sh42 million currently, creating paralysis in funding for projects and programmes, the MCA said. [Some of the debts] were not disclosed in the debt management strategy paper 2014-15, 2015-16 and the current fiscal year, the motion reads.Nyang wara said that by failing to disclose the debts, the governor grossly violated the constitution and the Public Finance Management Act.On Tuesday, the MCA filed a motion to impeach Kidero for allegedly flouting the procurement laws and failing to manage the county s debts. Nyang wara outlined eight grounds to remove the city boss from office. The motion will be debated next Tuesday,He said the governor also flouted the procurement laws when he contracted JamboPay to electronically collect revenue for the county. He said the selection criterion was suspicious and illegal . Citing numerous missteps in the procurement process, Auditor General Edward Ouko concluded that the 4.5 per cent retained by JamboPay is too high compared to what the Kenya Revenue Authority charges, Nyang wara says. The auditor found that two other bidders Virtual Mobile and Craftsilicon had bid to charge 2.5 per cent of the transaction costs, but were not considered. Nyang wara said a review of the cost impact using the actual revenues for the 2012-13 financial year established that the county government will spend Sh767.4 million in the five years the contract is supposed to run.Kidero disregarded the principle of public finance management when he unilaterally signed an agreement with an automobile firm, Foton, for the supply of buses, the MCA said.He said the governor also diverted to other uses millions of shillings disbursed by the national government for free maternity services.The Viwandani MCA also said Kidero has expenditure of collected revenue at source, leading to heavy revenue leaks and missed targets. This has greatly affected implementation of county programmes aimed at uplifting the lives of residents, leading to stalled projects and unpaid contractors, contrary to statute and constitutional provisions, the motion reads.Nyang wara said Kidero s administration has undermined the county assembly by wilfully refusing to implement resolutions of the House.
