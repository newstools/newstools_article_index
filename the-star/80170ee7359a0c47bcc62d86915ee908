In a country like Kenya, in which the majority of people make a living off the land and where maize is grown and eaten virtually nationwide anything that leads to improved yields for maize farmers is very good news indeed (see story page 13).For decades now, the Aflatoxin mould has presented a major challenge to Kenyan farmers. This mould grows on maize - from the seed to the mature cob - and makes it inedible, with the short-term threat of liver damage and the long-term likelihood of cancer.So it is welcome news a solution has been found to this problem, the Aflasafe KE01 product, which, according to ministry sources, will be available to farmers from the next planting season.This will save lives and lead to a substantial increase in productivity.Cobs deeply embedded with the grey mould that indicates the presence of Aflatoxin are a thing of the past as is throwing away substantial quantities of harvests.
