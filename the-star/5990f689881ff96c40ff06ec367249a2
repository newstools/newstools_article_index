Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has denied claims he allowed two mining companies to excavate against residents' wishes.Social media has been rife with claims the county chief - who recently ditched ODM for the Jubilee Party - is colluding with top government officials to control the county s vast mineral resources. But in a press conference on Tuesday, Mvurya expressed his government s commitment to protect resources. He said residents' welfare is his top priority.Executives and Deputy Governor Fatuma Achani were present.Mvurya said rivals are spreading divisive propaganda for selfish reasons. I have already raised the issue with the Mining Cabinet Secretary. No license has been issued for mining of minerals estimated to be worth Sh5.4 trillion. There are also baseless claims that an application for a special prospecting license by Base Titanium Mining Company to expand its operations in the county has been approved, he said.Mvurya urged politicians running for office to campaign responsibly "instead of spreading hateful words against their opponents".Social media was awash with claims the county government granted the licences to an Australian company and another unnamed firm. In 2013, the government revoked a license issued for mining of the rare earth to Cortec Mining Company that was associated with slain businessman Jacob Juma. We state categorically that no special prospecting license has indeed been issued to Base Titanium by the Ministry of Mining, and any alleged license in circulation was null and void, said Mvurya.On the issue of Base Titanium, Mvurya said that, it had made an application for a special license but rejected upon scrutiny after failing to follow the right legal process under the new Mining Act of 2016. The county government has not issued any consent and will not do so, until all the legal processes and collective involvement from the community and land owners as prescribed under the Mining Act have been met by the company or any other investor in the mining sector, he added.
