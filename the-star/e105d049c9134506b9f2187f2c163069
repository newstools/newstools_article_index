According to the Ethiopian calendar, their new year begins on September 13. Last week, they marked the day with celebrations at the Sheba Lounge in Mombasa. Foods and drinks flowed freely as Ethiopians from all walks of life came together to make merry. It was a lively affair as they put their best foot forward and dance the night away while waving their country's flags in the air.Two of the best dressed ladies walked away with rewards including an all paid expense return ticket to Dubai.In attendance was Mombasa county executive for culture Mohammed Abbas and Sheba Lounge CEO Kassie Wondwossen. We wish them a Happy and Prosperous New Year.
