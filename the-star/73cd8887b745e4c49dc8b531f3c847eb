Over 50 football coaches from Kericho County are undergoing a 10-day Football International Federation Association coaching course at Kericho Teachers Training College. The event which started last Wednesday will end on Wednesday next week. Those undergoing the training yesterday urged the Ministry Sports to set aside funds for coaches training in the country.Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Kericho sub-branch chairman Leonard Onchiri while thanking national body for approaching Fifa to sponsor the on-going training, said proper training would help Kenyan coaches identify untapped talents among the youth and expose them to high profile and professional soccer for their livelihood. FKF instructor Fred Serenge concurred with the participants sentiments and said they would present the participants grievances to the concerned ministry. It would be very much ideal if the national government helps the FKF in training programmes for the local coaches handling small teams. The FKF has now done training in bits so it would be of much help if the ministry chips in for progression of the programmes so that we can take football to the next level, said Serenge. Onchiri said the federation has shown the way and called on the ministry to adopt this for progression, saying it is now the responsibility of the government to adopt and implement what is good for the country.
