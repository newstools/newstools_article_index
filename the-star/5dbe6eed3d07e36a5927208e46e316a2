Mogotio OCS James Githinji is under investigation following a scuffle with a waitress in a bar at the town, Baringo county.Area police boss Patrick Nyangaresi said that the Sunday incident was reported to him by the owner of the bar.He said that the incident was sparked by a claim by the OCS that he had lost Sh12,500 under unclear circumstances. "After visiting the scene together with the area DCIO Otieno Nyamburi, we found waiters who were not willing to speak prompting me to look for the OCS," the OCPD said. He said that the OCS was traced to a local private clinic while undergoing treatment after he was hit by a reveler.The reveler is said to have rescued the waitress from being manhandled by the officer, who accused the lady of stealing his money. Nyangaresi said that the OCS turned on the waitress after she denied having stolen from him. "After hitting the OCS with a stool on the face, the reveler snatched a pistol from the drunk officer who fortunately held on to the magazine," he said. "The reveler was later called by the bar owner and when he was asked to return the pistol, he said that he was taking it to Menengai police station since he feared that he would be arrested if he took it to Mogotio police station," Nyangaresi said. The OCPD said that the pistol was later surrendered to him at night and the magazine with 15 rounds of ammunition kept in safe custody at the station. He said that all the parties have since recorded statements as investigations continue. The police boss said that the Rift Valley regional criminal investigations officer Henry Kiambati has taken up the matter.
