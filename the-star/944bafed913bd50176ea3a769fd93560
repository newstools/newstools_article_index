The Machakos county assembly should protect residents and their property, Chama Cha Uzalendo leader Wavinya Ndeti has said.Ndeti said MCAs should speedily pass laws ensuring residents are not unnecessarily evicted from their land.She spoke at a prayer meeting in Kayole market, Masinga subcounty, yesterday. Ndeti said there are increasing cases of land disputes which need to be addressed urgently.She said the assembly should give direction to the Lands ministry and the National Land Commission by passing legislation that offers solutions.Ndeti said the issue of squatters should be a thing of the past. She said there are many squatters, despite the region being the residents ancestral land. Ndeti cautioned the MCAs against ignoring the interests of the electorate by going to bed with the county government.She said leaders should play their oversight role to ensure proper use of public resources. As Ukambani leaders, we cannot let those in power do what they want. We must work for the people to help them get their rights, Ndeti said.She said the national and Machakos county governments should protect squatters in Muri Farm, Masinga, from being evicted by the Agricultural Finance Corporation.Ndeti said it is unfair for the residents, including elderly men and women aged 90 years, to be evicted from land they have called home for decades.She questioned why Governor Alfred Mutua is silent on the squatters evictions instead of helping them get their title deeds.Ndeti said the Machakos assembly should push the county government to pay off the Agricultural Finance Corporation s loan so that Muri Farm squatters are resettled on the 2,066 acres under dispute. We need peace. The aged should die only after holding their title deeds, she said.Ndeti called for President Uhuru Kenyatta s intervention to prevent the squatters from being forcibly evicted by the corporation.
