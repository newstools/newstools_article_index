The Political Parties Dispute Tribunal has dismissed an appeal by businesswoman Esther Passaris seeking to compel the Registrar of Political Parties to register her party.The tribunal said registrar Lucy Ndung u is within her rights to decline to register Harambee Democratic Party, as she did not violate any rights, as claimed.In the appeal, Passaris said the registrar erroneously alleged the proposed name violated the Political Parties Act because the name Harambee is part of the National Coat of Arms, recognised under the Constitution.She said the reasons given by the registrar to reserve the name Harambee are unlawful, unconstitutional and whimsical.Passaris said the allegation that the name does not comply with the Constitution and the Political Parties Act is a misinterpretation of the law.She said the registrar s decision may have been influenced by certain forces within certain political circles.The registrar denied being influenced.Ndung u said Passaris assertion is farfetched, has no basis in law and should be treated as mere political propaganda. We found the use of the name Harambee Democratic Party , for purposes of registering a political party, noncompliant with Section 8 of the Political Parties Act 2011, she said. The word Harambee is protected by law under Section 3 of the National Flag, Emblem and Names Act Cap 99 laws of Kenya. Passaris has said she will appeal the decision by the tribunal. Last month, she said the registrar s decision breaches international treaties and covenants. Passaris accused Ndung u of being oppressive and undemocratic.She said the registrar has infringed on her rights. Passaris said she has the right to protection from a biased and unfair application of the law.
