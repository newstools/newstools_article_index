Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has promised to ensure striking doctors get their&nbsp;allowances, salary arrears and promotion letters by the end of the week. Kidero addressed the medics after they marched to his office in protest on Wednesday. &ldquo;Go back to work. I have committed to&nbsp;all the issues you have raised &nbsp;in writing and will ensure they are addressed by this Friday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If by the end of Friday you will not have received your allowances, salaries and promotion letters, do not go to work next Monday.&quot; The doctors, led by KMPPDU&nbsp; secretary general Ouma Oluga, marched to City Hall from Kenyatta Hospital to seek audience with the Governor.&nbsp; They barricaded roads in the area during their demonstration.

The&nbsp;county had threatened to&nbsp; hire part-time&nbsp;doctors and engage trainees (interns) to replace the striking medics.&nbsp; But&nbsp; Oluga &nbsp; dared Kidero to sack saying they would not return to work without getting their pay. He called off the strike today saying they had agreed with the court&#39;s ruling but noted their demands remained.&quot;What we are demanding now is that we be treated with dignity, paid our salaries and allowances and given our promotion letters,&rdquo; he said. But medics who have completed probation said they had received their appointment letters. Health executive Bernard Muia had said the strike was illegal as it was against the agreement the doctors&#39; union struck on September 9 with the county,&nbsp; following a two-week strike notice on August 29. Among the doctor&#39;s complaints were&nbsp; the county&rsquo;s failure to remit their NHIF and NSSF deductions since January.&nbsp; They also complained that the county did not provide car and mortgage allowances.
