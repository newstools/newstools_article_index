Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has agreed to pay sacked Environment executive Evans Ondieki Sh8.8 million for wrongful dismissal.The two made an agreement before High Court judge Nduma Nderi yesterday to comply with a judgement against the county government. The Employment and Labour Relations court, in a judgment issued on August 5, ordered the county to pay the former executive unpaid salaries, gratuity and costs of the suit.Nderi of the Labour Court quashed Kidero s decision to remove Ondieki from office, saying it was not done in accordance with the law. The judge said the governor was unreasonable in sacking Ondieki on the basis that he attended a church service alongside former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru. The court orders compensation to the applicant equivalent to full gross salary, less taxation, for the unserved term of the contract between him and the county government the judge ruled.The judge, however, said though Ondieki was unfairly removed, he could not order his reinstatement. Ondieki had sued Kidero and the county government saying his removal was arbitrary.
