Kenya s Emmanuel Tirop and Barnabas Kiptum finished second and third behind Ethiopian winner Asefa Mengistu Negewo at the Sanlam Cape Town Marathon.The 31-year-old Ethiopian clocked 2:08:42 to shatter the long-standing South African all-comers marathon record at the Sanlam Cape Town Marathon, which is accredited as an IAAF Silver Label Road Race, over the weekend.In a tightly contested race through the scenic Cape Town city in the Western Cape, Negewo shook off stiff opposition by Kenyans Tirop and Kiptum to knock more than a minute from the previous fastest performance run of 2:09:50 set by South African David Tsebe in 1990.Negewo edged out Tirop, who crossed the line in 2:08:47, an improvement of more than six minutes on his previous best of 2:15:17 from 2014 ahead of Barnabas Kiptum who clocked in third at a time of 2:09:21, also a personal best for the 30-year-old. It is great to see such fast times being run on SA soil, which shows how much value a race of this stature brings to the sport at domestic level, said race ambassador and former world half-marathon record holder Elana Meyer.Further back, South Africans Motlokoa Nkhabutla and Desmond Mokgobu were fourth and fifth, clocking 2:11:02 and 2:11:33 respectively. Tish Jones of Great Britain was the surprise winner in the women s contest, clocking 2:36:13. For the 31-year-old, it was an improvement of nearly 20 minutes from her only other recorded marathon.
