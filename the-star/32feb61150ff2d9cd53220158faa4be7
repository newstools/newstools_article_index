Former national team coach and captain Steve Tikolo returned to haunt his countrymen as he led Uganda to a two-wicket win over Kenya as the Cricket Kenya Quadrangular series entered the third day yesterday in Nairobi.Deus Muhumuza picked up five for, and went on to put on superb display with the bat (16 not out) to lead his side to a memorable win over their cricket big brothers .Even though Kenyans took the match easily after qualifying for today s final with wins over Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the victory will go into the history of Uganda as a big one as it was the first time, they were achieving it. The win was also memorable for Tikolo, who was Kenya s coach until April this year when CK terminated his contract.Needing 202 to win after a huge batting collapse by the Kenyan batsmen, Uganda were in control of the match, putting on 147 for the loss of two wickets.However, Kenya bounced back with quick wickets but Francis Nsubuga and Muhumuza saw their team home with an unbeaten ninth wicket stand.An opening century stand between Alex Obanda and Dhiren Gondaria had put Kenyan in the driving seat before a top and middle order collapse saw Kenya lose nine wickets for 90 runs, finally ending up on 201.Gondaria (65) and Obanda (50) compiled 111 runs of Kenya s 201 total. But when the Gondaria fell and Karan Kaul (6) and Obanda followed in quick succession, Kenya failed to recover and found themselves starring at a low score.Muhumuza was the main architect of the collapse with five wickets. After Mohammed Irfan had left Kenya two down with the wickets of Gondaria and Kaul, Muhumuza got into the attack immediately and reduced Kenya to 169 for 6 from 123 for 2 with four wickets. Anytime Kenya thought of bouncing back, the right handed bowler attacked with his slow balls that caught the batsmen with little options.Rakep Patel, Gurdeep Singh, Nelson Odhiambo, Shem Ngoche and Nehemiah Odhiambo all fell to Muhumuza.
