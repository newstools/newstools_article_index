A section of Kaya elders from Kilifi and Kwale counties have dismissed a prayer event at the Kayafungo to bless former Labour CS Kazungu Kambi for his governor bid.The elders, drawn from the Jibana, Ribe, Rabai and Kwale kayas, said Kambi disrespected elders and broke Mijikenda tradition by taking foreigners into the Kaya Forest.Speaking in Mazeras town on Saturday after declining to attend the prayers, Council of Elders branch chairman Erastus Kubo said, Kambi has been insulting and misusing us. He has on several occasions referred to us as naked elders. How could he invite leaders who are not from the Mijikenda community to enter our sacred forest? Kambi was unavailable for comment.
