Senators yesterday differed sharply on how to deal with a petition against Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka.Senators Boni Khalwale (Kakamega), Moses Wetang ula (Bungoma) and Catherine Mukite (nominated) wanted to cross-examine Lusaka, who appeared before the Public Finance Committee at County Hall, after responding to each allegation.However, senators Aaron Cheruyiot (Kericho), Wilfred Machage (Migori), John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot), Beatrice Elachi (nominated), Paul Njoroge (nominated) and committee vice chairman Peter Mositet (Kajiado) wanted Lusaka to respond to all allegations before senators would cross-examine him.Wetang ula and Khalwale said by allowing Lusaka to respond to all allegations first, senators were likely to forget some issues, considering the voluminous documents presented as evidence. But Mositet ruled them out of order and allowed the governor to proceed. He said senators would get time to read the documents before seeking clarification from the governor.Lusaka (pictured) dismissed the petition. He has been accused of mismanaging county funds. He told the committee the petitioners relied on hearsay and some of the issues raised are being investigated by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.Peter Wanyama and some CEC members said the allegations are ridiculous. Wanyama criticised the committee for pushing Lusaka to provide evidence, yet the burden of proof should be on the petitioners.
