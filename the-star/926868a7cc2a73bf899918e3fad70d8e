Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka and Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi have accused each other of not living up to voters expectations.On Monday, Lusaka told Wamunyinyi to keep off county affairs and concentrate on developing his constituency.He said instead of the legislator serving his constituents, he is busy tainting the image of his administration. Wamunyinyi should not belittle me at all. My development record speaks for itself. What has he done with the CDF that he should be proud of if we may ask? the governor asked.On Friday last week, Wamunyinyi accused the county boss of failing to develop the county, despite receiving huge amounts of money from the national government. He said Lusaka has ridiculed Bungoma residents and should not be voted back.
