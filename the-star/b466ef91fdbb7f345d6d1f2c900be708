Coast general hospital in Mombasa is expected to operate 30 women suffering from fistula.This was revealed during the launching of Fistula week camp on Monday by the county health department.Chief gynaecologist Faiza Nassir said they have diagnosed 60 women who are suffering from fistula, which is caused by a hole between two body organs that causes incontinence in women.Nassir said most patients treated at the hospital are not Mombasa residents, as most of them are from Kilifi and Kwale counties.She said out of 30 to be operated, 2 are from Mombasa.During the camp, surgery and screening for the condition will be free. In most private clinics, fistula surgery can be up to Sh300,000.The gynaecologist revealed that home delivery methods is the main reason for the high prevalence in Kilifi and Kwale counties. Women in these areas give birth at home and undergo the maternal period at herbalists instead of hospitals,traditional doctors cannot detect the disease early therefore it ends being chronic, Nassir said.Other causes of fistula are rape and defilement, female genital mutilation and early sexual intercourse among young girls.
