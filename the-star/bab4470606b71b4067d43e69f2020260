Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto was yesterday taken to task to explain why the county paid more than Sh9.4 million to various companies contracted to maintain motor vehicles without an inspection report.The Senate Public Accounts Committee raised concerns about "huge payments" spent on vehicle repairs. Senators Kennedy Mong'are (Nyamira), Boni Khalwale (Kakamega), Kimani Wamatangi (Kiambu) and Martha Wangari (nominated) said some vouchers for more than Sh3 million paid did not indicate the specific vehicles repaired.Wamatangi sought to know why the governor allowed senior county officers to authorise expenditure on fuel worth Sh18.8 million without adhering to procedures. How can an officer allow sticky notes to be used to incur expenditure? Anybody can pick such notes and walk to a fuel station to get fuel, Wamatangi raised. Nyong o said the inspection reports were crucial to determine that kind of repairs that were to be carried out in order to justify the payments.Rutto who appeared before the committee CECs told the committee that the systems by then allowed senior officers to authorize procurement of fuel from petrol stations and records were available to confirm that the funds spent on fuel was properly utilized. I am aware the senior officers were to authorize withdraw of fuel and that had to be recorded in the work ticket and the kilometres covered, Rutto told the committee.According to the Auditor General 's report of 2013/2014 shows that the fuel registers availed for audit were poorly maintained and in some cases did not indicate the amount of fuel drawn or the balances after each fuelling.
