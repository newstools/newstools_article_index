Conseslus appointed Ndalat Gaa race ambassadorOlympic 3000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto will lead a galaxy of athletics stars to the eighth edition of the Ndalat Gaa Cross Country in Nandi County on October 15.Kipruto has been appointed the race ambassador for this year, which marks the end of the event under the brand name Ndalat, as the organisers restructure to rebrand it after the late Athletics Kenya president Isaiah Kiplagat, the founder. Ndalat was my first cross country when I was in high school in 2010 where I was fourth before placing second a year later, said Kipruto. I have been running there to close the season in year after year and I am happy to return there again. After that I will take a rest for one month before returning back to train. This year s race will be used to raise funds for the Kimbilio Hospice, a facility used to cater for children and adults living with life threaitening illnesses like cancer HIV/Aids, severe malnutrition and disability. We have been running the event without a course to support but as the local organising committee we found it necessary to partner with Kimbilio Hospice, a very worth course, said AK Central Rift Abraham Mutai.The hospice is located in Eldoret West District.The event will incorporate 10 different races targeting kids between seven and eight years to veterans of 56 years and above.The organisers were yesterday given a cash boost of Sh2m from Safaricom, Sh1.2m from the Nandi County government, Sh300,000 from the Mosop Constituency Development Fund.The race will be open, with no registration fee. Registration will be done on the day of the race. We are expecting over 5,000 runners in about 10 categories and would therefore be tricky to organise for registration in their own areas, added Mutai.
