Now that the highly polarising controversy over the IEBC is more or less settled, this might be the right time to consider the question of winners and losers in this great drama.Well, in my view, the two biggest winners were President Uhuru Kenyatta and his arch-rival, opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.The big losers, of course, were the IEBC commissioners, and in particular chairman Isaack Hassan. For it is very rare in our history that the entire nation, recognising that there is an extremely difficult task to be undertaken, unites in a consensus that we have found the right man for the job.However such was the level of confidence that the nation had in Hassan, when he first ascended to that high office.But where is he now?For all the talk about leaving with dignity , he and his fellow commissioners are now headed out of office deeply humiliated; their tails firmly between their legs; asking only that they be allowed to receive the balance of what they might have earned if they had stayed in office until the proper end of their tenure.And of course the man who vanquished the commissioners was Raila. This is not to diminish the role played by the other two key opposition leaders, the former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang ula.But go back, if you will, to the end of May, 2014, when Raila returned from a two-month sabbatical in Boston, and addressing his signature mammoth crowd in Uhuru Park declared there was so much going wrong in Kenya that the President must immediately convene a national dialogue forum to address these problems.And of these challenges, none was given more emphasis than that the IEBC had, in 2013, failed to give Kenyans a free, fair and credible general election, and so must be disbanded forthwith.Now, be honest and ask yourself: Did you really expect Raila to succeed back then in this stated objective? For many of us, it seemed highly improbable, especially given the constitutional protections under which the IEBC operates.And yet here we are: The IEBC commissioners who at one point naively declared that they would rather go to prison than resign are now meekly headed for the door.This is but one more example of why Raila for all the many setbacks he has faced remains one of the nation s most influential politicians. He is a patient strategist who always plays the long game and persists in struggling to attain his goals, long after most of us would have readily given up.But why do I say that Uhuru also won? Well, as my fellow columnist Machel Waikenda pointed out yesterday, it takes statesmanship to figure out when to take one step back, before subsequently taking several steps forward.It is one thing to have the police send teargas canisters flying towards the massed opposition demonstrators. But once there is live TV coverage of police applying extreme brutality in dealing with these demonstrators; once there are well-documented cases of unarmed demonstrators shot dead by the police; and above all, once influential groups like the donor community, religious leaders and civil society begin to argue that a practical solution must swiftly be found to restore a semblance of order in the country; that is the time for a prudent leader to begin to make compromises.And I would add that this is indeed one of the President s finest qualities: That he is neither a narrow-minded ideologue nor a political extremist. He is exceptional in his willingness to seek common ground with even his fiercest political rivals.There are politicians in this country who under those same circumstances would not have conceded an inch if they had been president. They would not have wanted to appear weak. They would have set out to teach the demonstrators a lesson .And so the street demos would have continued; more lives would have been lost; and there is no telling where Kenya would have been by now, in its downward spiral towards more bloodshed and political chaos: Just as seems to be happening in Ethiopia right at this moment.
