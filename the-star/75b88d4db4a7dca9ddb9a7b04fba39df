The Banking Fraud Unit is searching for two men linked to the fraudulent use of two title deeds to secure a loan from ABC bank.Mohamed Abdi and Aress Ibrahim of AIMA Enterprises allegedly used the titles as collateral without the holder's knowledge.They are said to have colluded with Gulf African and ABC banks to defraud businessman Mohamed Aden of his 0.03 hectares of land in Lang'ata, Nairobi. The property has two titles as it was subdivided.A detective who did not want to be named said Abdi and Ibrahim used the titles to obtain Sh240 million in 2012 and went into hiding early this year.The businessman sued the two banks for releasing his title deeds without due authority, consent or knowledge.Court documents obtained by the Star say he wants AIMA Enterprises, GAB and ABC banks compelled to return the original documents.The case was filed at the commercial division of the High Court on September 23 under a certificate of urgency.In the suit filed at the Environment and Lands Court, Aden accused AIMA, GAB and ABC banks of attempting to defraud him of his property.He said in a sworn affidavit that he guaranteed AIMA a loan of Sh48 million from GAB and later learnt that the land whose title deeds he used as security was on sale.This was after ABC bank, through a notice in one of the local dailies, called for auctioneers to buy the land so that it recovers the money borrowed by the two traders.Aden also alleged that AIMA and ABC bank conspired to forge his signature to effect the transfer of the security that he deposited with GAB.The collateral was deposited through a charge document dated May 6, 2011 and he would learn that the same was changed to ABC on November 16, 2012 by the wanted persons.He said AIMA and GAB breached their contract of guarantee since he is unable to redeem the property under the current circumstances."My equity of redeeming the said property has been fettered and I am at risk of sustaining loss and damage," he said in his affidavit.ABC bank intends to sell the property to recover costs from the loan acquired by AIMA. The firm processed the loan and allegedly instructed GAB to cede the security to ABC."The deal was sealed under a bank to bank undertaking," Aden said in the case in which he is represented by lawyer Omondi Omollo of Kibungei and Company Advocates.Through a letter to GAB on October 28, 2015, he informed the bank that they will be held responsible for any loss and expense as a result of the fraudulent transfer.The letter was copied to the ABC bank as well; with word that they will be liable for any loss and expense that might be vested on him following the loan obtained by the two missing traders."We are instructed that about November 22, 2012, without knowledge, authority or consent of our client received the title documents from Gulf African bank and caused to be charged the aforementioned properties to the tune of Sh 100 million," the letter to ABC bank reads in part.Aden's lawyer Omondi Omollo said they want ABC stopped from selling the land or changing its holder until the matter is heard and determined.In their reply on November 17, 2015, ABC bank stated that it only took over the loan borrowed by AIMA Enterprises from Gulf African Bank.But the bank said it was not aware of any fraud with regard to the discharge of charge at GAB or release of documents to itself."The securities were released to the bank from Gulf upon acceptance of a bank to bank undertaking," ABC said in its response to the letter from Aden's lawyers."All securities registered in our favour were done legally and under the instructions and full knowledge of Aden (the Chargor) and the borrower," the bank said.The bank has denied any allegations of fraud as well as all liability associated with the irregular transfer of the title deeds used as security to acquire a loan from it.But Aden said he fears losing his land since ABC bank has been sending auctioneers to sell the property; a matter that the bank declined to comment on.The banks did not respond to phone calls and messages for comment.
