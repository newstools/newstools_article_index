At least 300 Kenyans had by 9pm on Monday signed an online petition for the disbandment of the Kenya Film Classification Board currently chaired by Ezekiel Mutua. The petitioner, Haroun Risa, claims that a bill proposed by the board goes against freedom of expression in the country."Article 33 of the Kenyan constitution clearly states that every person has the right to freedom of expression, which includes; freedom to seek, receive or impart information or ideas, freedom of artistic creativity and academic freedom and freedom of scientific research," the petition read in part. The petitioner termed the recommendations in the bill as an insult to artists, and is targeting 100,000 signatures. Risa cited sections of the proposed bill that are seen to be retrogressive in the gains made towards popularising art as a means of livelihood.Section 40(1) of the bill states: "No stage play may be exhibited in a place to which the public or a section of the public is invited to attend, whether or not a charge is made for admission to the premises in which the exhibition is held, unless such stage play has been classified by the board," Read: Media Owners to sue films board for censoring advertisements And section 40 (2) states that a person who exhibits a stage play in contravention of subsection (1) is guilty of an offense and liable on conviction to a fine of two hundred thousand shillings or a term of two years imprisonment or both.It is these proposals that the petitioners have listed as among the reasons they want the Ezekiel Mutua team sent packing."Now is the time to call for the disbandment of the KFCB, and either a thorough revision of Cap 222 (The Film and Stage Plays Act) of the Laws of Kenya, or its repealing," the petition states. "We cannot allow the creativity of Kenyans to be curtailed by egoistic individuals, this we must unite as Kenyan artists, creatives, filmmakers, stageplay practitioners, and all Kenyans sick of people who want to exercise dictatorship on Kenyan creatives," Risa added.Kenyans on Twitter posted their reservations with the bills with the #StopTheFilmBill. The aim of KOT is to ensure that the bill doesn't become law. Read: Films board bans Art Attack's 'Same Love (Remix)' for being immoralAlso read: Netflix content immoral, says films board
