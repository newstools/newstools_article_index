Deputy President William Ruto on Sunday told church leaders in Kenya to pray for Cord so that they could engage the government on constructive issues .The DP regretted that instead of engaging the government on development matters as per their manifesto, the opposition was hell-bent to discredit the Jubilee government."We need development partners and not those who are taking us back to the dark days of political rhetoric that had no better agenda for this country," Ruto said.The DP made the remarks at Moi Gardens, Kericho during a fundraiser for the region's Seventh Day Adventist churches.He said it is only prayers from church leaders which will change the opposition in Kenya to engage the government on constructive politics.The DP was accompanied by Kericho governor Paul Chepkwony, CSs Charles Keter (Energy) Willy Bett (Agriculture), Kericho senator Aaron Cheruiyot, MPs Benjamin Langat (Ainamoi), Joseph Limo (Kipkelion East), Jackson Rop (Kipkelion West), Justice Kemei (Sigowet/Soin), Leonard Sang (Bureti), Eric Keter (Belgut) and woman representative Hellen Chepkwony.He said the merger of parties into Jubilee party was purely to unify all Kenyans and regardless of one's ethnic or religious background."President Uhuru Kenyatta and I came up with idea of JP purely to bring on board all Kenyans without discrimination of any kind," Ruto said."Through the help of church leaders we can go somewhere on development for all Kenyans. Right from Coast to the West and North to the South without the political hiccups we are being subjected to by the opposition," Ruto said.Read: Jubilee using taxpayers money to lure opposition leaders - Amani
