Three Nyeri county executives, who were jailed for three years on Monday, are being treated like ordinary inmates with no special privileges.Officer-in-charge at King ong o Prison Patrick Arandu said there is no favouritism. They are John Maina (former Lands executive), Martin Wamwea (Finance) and Chief of Staff Simon Wachira.Maina is accused of irregularly awarding a contract for consultancy of audit services to Pleng Kenya without approval. Wamwea, was charged with abuse of office for authorising processing of Sh3,756,962 to pay Pleng Kenya Ltd without supporting documents.Wachira was charged with two counts of failing to comply with procurement laws and improper use of public office. Arandu said even the food they are eating is the same at that of other inmates. They received counselling. On Wednesday, Kieni MP Kanini Kega took nyama choma to them at the facility but was prevented from giving it to them. Prison officials said they give inmates a balanced diet.Kega said he was visiting them, since they are his friends. Actually, they are very shocked. There is no preferential treatment for them, the MP said. The High Court in Nyeri has declined to hear their appeal as urgent. The matter will come up on October 17.
