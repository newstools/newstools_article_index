The school's management said they had been promised 120 desks through the Kinango CDF.Tayari said: "I also gave the candidates geometric sets and writing materials. I did the same for candidates at Karyaka Primary School."The aspirant said he only just learnt about the lack of desks at the school."I felt it was not right for such a thing to happen in the 21st century yet we have leaders and a government in place," he said.Read: Siaya education officials interdicted, exam cancelled over Rasanga photoAl read: Exam personalised for Gucha politician exposed after Matiang'i interdicts Siaya officialsThe school also lacks a number of amenities, leave alone having only one female teacher and one toilet shared by both girls and boys.Tayari blamed bad leadership in the constituency for the problems being experienced at the institution."What these pupils go through is unacceptable.
