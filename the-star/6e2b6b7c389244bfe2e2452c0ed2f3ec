The Moi University Council has declined to make public the results of interviews for the recruitment of a new VC done more than three month ago.Chairman Jenesio Kimanyario says their mandate is to complete the interviews and hand over the results to the Education CS to appoint in line with government regulations. We have no mandate to make the results public. After the interviews, we handed over the names as required by law. The rest does not involve us, he told the Star.He spoke as professionals from the North Rift region, led by lawyer Stephen Cherargei, said they will move to court to sue CS Fred Matiang i and the council to release the results. Under the law, the public has the right to information. We will ensure the results are made public, Cherargei said.He criticised Matiang i for taking too long to name a substantive office holder.Cherargei said the information, if made public, will help resolve the row over who should be VC. Several politicians led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago stormed the institution last week to stop acting VC Laban Ayiro from taking over.The Universities Academic Staff Union has urged political leaders to stop interfering with the management of universities.Uasu Moi University chapter secretary Jack Abok says the recent action amounted to interference in the independence of the institution.
