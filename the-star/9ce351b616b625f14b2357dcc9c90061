Bomet Senator Wilfred Lesan has criticised a section of Myoot Kipsigis Council of Elders for opposing the implementation of the Itare water project in Nakuru county.He accused them of being misused by anti-development individuals .The elders sued the state over plans to divert water from a catchment area to Itare Dam. They moved to the High Court in Nakuru to stop the government from proceeding with the plan. The elders said the suit, to stop the planned diversion and subsequent construction of the Itare Dam, was filed on behalf of residents of Kericho and Bomet counties. Lesan wants them to withdraw the case.He said the elders do not have a substantive case for blocking the project. Why would one want people to believe that Itare River would dry up if that is not pure malice? Lesan asked.He said it was wrong for the elders to move to court before exhausting other resolution mechanisms. We are concerned that this could be a ploy by politicians opposed to Jubilee in the Rift Valley to portray us negatively as we head to the next election, he said.
