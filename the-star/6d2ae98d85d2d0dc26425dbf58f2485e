A Kakamega MCA will table a motion to sack Health executive Peninah Mukabane over the nine-day nurses strike, alleged abuse of office and nonperformance.The strike was halted on Wednesday. Nurses and doctors from public hospitals went on strike to protest against intimidation, discrimination and lack of promotions. Nominated MCA Alex Khamasi yesterday said he will table the sacking motion next Tuesday. Collection of signatures is complete and the time is right to ask Governor Wycliffe Oparanya to sack the minister, he said. Khamasi said Mukabane is guilty of abuse of office for threatening to sack striking nurses. He said Mukabane does not have powers to do so. Khamisi said Mukabane was an underperformer when she was the Environment executive and she should not have been moved to the sensitive health docket. He faulted Oparanya for failing to fire Mukabane last year when she was in the health docket despite the assembly adopting the report by a committee that recommended her sacking. On Tuesday, Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong said medics were overwhelmed by Kakamega residents who sought treatment in the county. We have accepted patients on humanitarian grounds. It is a burden considering we are also receiving several patients from Uganda. But we will try our best despite the limited resources, he said.The County Governments Act requires that a third of MCAs support a motion to sack an executive. Twenty-nine out of the 87 ward representatives will have to support the motion to sack Mukabane.
