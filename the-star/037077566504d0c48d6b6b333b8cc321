Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo has said President Uhuru Kenyatta's 'meat' remarks indicated his Jubilee coalition had failed and that it was time for Cord to take over.Uhuru told opposition leader Raila Odinga on September 14 that Jubilee was feasting on meat, while they were still finding their footing and salivating.Raila had said Jubilee Party had two hands; one that makes Kenyans suffer and another geared towards development.Five days after the spat with Raila, Uhuru and several Nairobi Jubilee politicians ate nyama choma at Kenyatta market during an impromptu tour of the city on Monday.Gumbo said: "When the President hints that as Jubilee they are eating and other Kenyans should continue to salivate, it is a demonstration that they are out of touch with citizens."The MP said Uhuru's remarks painted the picture that his government was not ready to take care of the majority of Kenyans who are poor.He said Cord will form a government that will cater for the 40 per cent Kenyans "salivating and living below the poverty line".Gumbo welcomed a proposal by a section of ODM members for joint nominations for Cord parties.Speaking at Rakombe ACK church,in Rarieda, on Sunday, the MP underlined that that what Cord has in the offing is not a replica of Jubilee Party's style of operation.He said joint nominations do not necessarily mean the formation of one large party but the avoidance of internal competition."Cord affiliate parties should not compete among themselves as that will give Jubilee Party, out main competitor, leeway," he said.Gumbo further noted that Cord parties are governed by alike policies, making negotiated democracy during nominations a wise decision.The MP warned all Cord officials against stretching their "sycophancy" for party leaders to frustrate others, and said they should observe democracy.He said the officials should ensure nominations are based on ideologies, not personalities.Read: Let s go for joint nominations, Raila urges two Cord partnersAlso read: Raila backs Kalonzo in push for joint Cord nominations
