Samsung reclaimed the Kenya International 12-goal title in a tightly contested final on Sunday at the Nairobi Polo Club.South African polo whiz Buster Mackenzie captained and inspired his team, Samsung, to winning the crown unbeaten. Samsung last won the coveted trophy in 2014 with Mackenzie as the skipper.Following the high-scoring match pitting SnS Samurai and MICT, the atmosphere at the club was electric as crowds welcomed their favourite teams on the turf. Both teams undefeated in the run up to the finals of the extravaganza were ready to battle for the top honours of the 12-goal Samsung Kenya International.The final match was tough, with both sides playing a fast and highly defensive game, much to the delight of the glowing crowd.Samsung started off with a 1F goal advantage, and three fast goals were scored midway through the chukka. And after a change of ponies at that point, shots were not forthcoming but Manyatta Polo Club s Henry Limb (2) hit one through the posts at the bell, catapulting Samsung ahead (3F-2).Through Mbugu Ngugi s goal, Samsung assumed a 4F-2 lead but Royal Salute rallied from behind, scoring two to reduce the deficit to a fraction (4F-4). The third chukka which was marked by tigerish defence with several fouls being awarded mainly for infringement, ended goal-less. With both line-ups determined to grab the prestigious title, Mackenzie upset Royale Salute s efforts after Davy Evans had put the losers ahead 5-4F, to end the game 5F-5 in favour of Samsung.After three days of the round-robin play, S&amp;S Samurai and MICT faced off to claim the third position. Having started the tournament on a losing streak, MICT (Uruguayan Santi Sterling 5, Tarquin Gross 2, Phillip Arungah 2 and Geoff Morley 1) were highly defensive into the first two chukkas leading the game at 3F-3.
