Two institutions yesterday accused the Transition Authority of shambolic work when it compiled the register for assets and liabilities inherited by the county governments from the local authorities.The TA used used the wrong approach, the Senate Public Accounts Committee was told by Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya and his Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee counterpart Karega Mutahi. It was untenable how TA was auditing and compiling assets registers for the counties. The list it compiled is incorrect, Mutahi told the committee chaired by Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong o at Parliament Buildings.Munya said, I share the sentiments and issues presented by the IGRTC.There was mismanagement of transition by TA on identification of assets and their registration. They came up with huge budgets to carry out the work. They were not in a hurry hence they were asking for extension of their term. Mutahi said whereas the TA chose a centralised auditing system of the assets, his committee has opted for a decentralised method, where transfers are done on as is where is through a legal notice. Before expiry of its term, the authority prepared an inventory of assets and liabilities of the local authorities, but did not carry out the audit, he said.Mutahi said upon taking over the residual functions, IGRTC analysed the situation and noted that ownership of assets and liabilities remained unresolved, long after the county governments started operating. This meant these assets have no protection from abuse, he said.Mutahi told the committee there is need for subsequent verification of the inventories of assets and liabilities, as listed by the TA, and any other that may have been identified.
