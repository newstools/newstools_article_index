Kakamega Jubilee Party members have asked two governors to apologise to Luhyas for rejecting professor Laban Ayiro's appointment as acting Moi University VC.Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet) stormed the institution with MPs demanding the appointment of Isaac Kosgey, whom they said "topped recruitment interviews".Manyala Keya, Raphael Welimo and Desmond Shinaka, former officials of disbanded Jubilee affiliate parties, said the politicians were getting in the way of JP's popularity. Their action to block Ayiro from taking over just because he is not a Kalenjin is against the Tuko Pamoja slogan for Jubilee, Shinaka said on Wednesday. Welimo said the move would make it difficult to sell Jubilee in the region. We as Jubilee Kakamega branch will not be part of these bad manners, he said.Mandago threatened during the protest to disrupt the university's graduation ceremony set for Saturday.Read: Matayos MP castigates Kalenjin leaders over Moi University VC debacleKakamega Knut and Kuppet officials also cautioned North Rift leaders against fueling ethnic animosity ahead of the 2017 general elections.Acadious Liyayi (Kakamega Knut secretary), Patrick Chungani (county Knut chairman) and Kuppet secretary for the area Harrison Otota warned Mandago and Tolgos against belittling Luhya professionals."They should come out clearly if they want everyone to work in their respective home counties.
