ODM has issued a one-week ultimatum to the National Treasury to release cash for IEBC commissioners to leave office or they stage protests.Leaders James Orengo (Siaya senator), Fred Outa (Nyando MP) and Junet Mohamed (Suna East) said that the looming protests will be ferrocious and murkier than the ones staged in May.They asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to move with speed and facilitate the commissioner's exit, failure to which they will show Jubilee why fowls lack horns .Orengo said in Mombasa on Saturday that they suspect a Jubilee conspiracy to deliberately delay the 2017 general election by curtailing the approval of funds to cater for the IEBC team's exit."There is a plot by Uhuru to block recruitment of new commissioners. Should he fail to release the funds, we shall fight the war we know best," he said.The sentiments by the ODM leaders are likely to subject Kenya to another tumultuous political confrontation and violent demonstrations.The nine IEBC commissioners had indicated that they are ready to quit office if they are paid a total of Sh164 million.Read: IEBC bosses to receive Sh164m send-off packageWith the next election date already set for August 8, the joint parliamentary committee resolving the IEBC stalemate and which struck a win-win deal said the new commissioners must be hired as soon as possible.There is no law requiring their exit, save for the gentleman s agreement that they should vacate.Read: Muturi heaps blame on Treasury, SRC over slump on IEBC team exitThe anti-IEBC protests staged by Cord were bloody; and resulted into the death of at least five demonstrators as well as injuries to tens of others.Orengo said Attorney General Githu Muigai and Treasury CS Henry Rotich, during a the joint parliamentary group meeting confirmed that there were funds.
