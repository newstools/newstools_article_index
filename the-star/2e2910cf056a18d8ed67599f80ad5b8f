Coca cola CEO Ibrahim El Khoury is expected to appear before the Mombasa county assembly health committee to give explanations on a case of contaminated Dasani water.Ward representatives claimed they found pieces of cotton wool in five bottles of Dasani water last Wednesday, spelling trouble for the company.The MCAs demanded answers through the House committee, saying this was the second such incident.Committee chair Swaleh Kibwana, who is Miritini MCA, said El Khourty is expected on Thursday morning.Kibwana said they want to know how the water found its way to the market if it is contaminated. We need to know why the company released contaminated water because it is worrying when you think of the public who have unknowingly consumed it, he said.The Kenya Bureau of Standards suspended the production of Dasani water at Coca Cola Company s Kikambala plant in Kilifi county.This followed a visit by Kebs officers after the Mombasa MCAs complained.Regional manager Martin Nyakiamo said the suspension will remain until after surveillance inspectors give the production line a clean bill of health.Coca Cola recalled units that were bottled between September 16 and 18.The 6,500 half-litre bottles were to be distributed at the Coast.Read: Cotton wool found in Dasani water in MombasaAlso read: Kebs suspends production of Dasani water at the Coast
