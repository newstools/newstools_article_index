Boda boda operators in Lari constituency should have a passenger register at night to reduce cases of motorcycle robbery, an official has said.Deputy county commissioner Aaron Koros said thieves who used to injure riders before robbing them of their motorcycles have started coming back.He said statistics indicates that, three years ago, an operator would be maimed, injured or killed every week and their motorcycles are stolen.But the trend stopped when the government and the operators partnered to enhance security, Koros said. It seems like the robbers have started coming back. Some of them are from prison after serving a sentence and they want to go back to their initial business, he said.Speaking to the press on the phone, Koros said security has been beefed up.He added that police and administrators are educating operators on personal security.They have asked operators to recording their customers' names, ID numbers and mobile phone numbers from 7pm until 12pm. We have started having meetings with them, teaching them how to handle customers at night and making suspicion reports, Koros said.He was reacting to reports of an incident on Wednesday last week where a passenger hit operator Francis Marete on the head with an iron bar and two men appeared and stubbed him three times with knife before fleeing.Marete was discovered by AP officers patrolling the area and rushed to Nazareth Hospital.Area MP Mburu Kahangara said boda bodas have created jobs, but robbers are frustrating the business by robbing, injuring and killing operators.
