President Uhuru Kenyatta has issued a stern warning against officers frustrating the enforcement and swift implementation of Access to Government Procurement Opportunities law.The law led to amendment to the procurement rules allowing 30 per cent of contracts to be awarded to the youth, women and persons living with disability without competition from established firms.However, at State House Youth Summit yesterday, participants said corruption in procurement, failure to adhere to government 2013 directive to have 30 per cent of all government tenders awarded to them and delayed payment are the major problems to youth progress.The President put tender committees and procurement officers, who fail to implement the law, on notice. Procurement officers who deny youths contracts will be sacked. We no longer pretend that we don't know what is happening. We can't uplift the young people, if we deny them opportunities, Uhuru said.The president also urged Kenyans to think positively about their nation as a route to true transformation. Sometimes, Kenyans are the most negative about their country when foreigners believe in us. Who gives a damn about who should be what? What we should give a damn about, is where Kenya will be in the next 20 years, Uhuru said. We should focus on issues that are critical to the lives of Kenyans and future of the country. Uhuru urged Kenyans to stop pointing fingers but provide solutions to the problems hurting the country.On the National Youth Service programme, the president said the challenges should be fixed.He also promised that his government will follow up and make sure that royalties for music artists are paid.
