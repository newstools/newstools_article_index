Thika United received major boost as skipper Dennis Odhiambo returns tomorrow to face relegation-bound Nairobi City Stars in SportPesa Premier League match.The milkmen confirmed through their official website that Odhiambo will be available for selection after a two-match suspension. Thika United won the first leg match against City Stars by a solitary goal.Meanwhile, the match has been moved backward to accommodate an earlier kick-off pitting Ushuru against Chemelil Sugar. The double header will not be live and will kick-off at 2pm and 4:15pm respectively at Kasarani Stadium.Elsewhere, Muhoroni Youth forward Lwamba Bebeto has criticised for Mathare United for playing to draw their match against the Awasi-based side. The two teams played out to a barren draw in a Kenyan Premier League match played on Wednesday, with the hosts desperate for a top eight finish. Bebeto said a top eight finish is still on the cards and that the team will be aiming for maximum points in the four remaining matches. We did our part, tried to push for the win, unfortunately it could not happen because the opponents had a different motive. They wanted a draw from the way they were playing, especially in the second half, and at the end of the day they managed to get it, Bebeto said. Muhoroni Youth is now placed in the 9th position with 34 points and will face Gor Mahia in the final of KPL Top 8 on Sunday. Goal.com
