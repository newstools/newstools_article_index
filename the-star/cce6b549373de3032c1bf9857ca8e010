Opposition leader Raila Odinga will visit Kwale county for two days, starting tomorrow, amid raising political temperatures following the defection of Governor Salim Mvurya to Jubilee.Mvurya joined Jubilee citing infighting in ODM after some leaders, including Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori, threatened to deny him the party ticket.Raila is reported to have endorsed Mvurya for reelection.MP hopeful Benjamin Tayari said Odinga will attend a rally at Kinango subcount to popularise the party.Railas visit aims to reinforce ODM's dominion in the region.Speaking to the Star on the phone yesterday, Tayari dismissed claims Jubilee has won over Kwale residents after Mvurya's defection. Kwale cannot join Jubilee just because one person joined. The county is among those that have been marginalised by the past and current government. The only solution to our issues is to help ODM take over leadership, he said.Tayari said the region will remain an opposition stronghold "until Raila makes it to the presidency in 2017 to address historical injustices and marginalisation". The Jubilee government cannot be trusted to solve issues of Kwale residents because they have not done anything so far," he said.
