I must say that I think it is a bad idea for anybody to imply that certain governors should have their party tickets reserved for them.This would be undemocratic.It would be no different from me saying that I should automatically be given nomination by my party without facing competition. My point is simply this: Let competition prevail. This is good for our democracy. And let the best man win.The arguments some governors are using that they have done so much leave a lot to be desired. In fact, many of our governors, if you were to quantify the amounts of money they have received for the last four years, vis-a-vis the projects they have initiated, have not really been that impressive.Therefore it is wrong for them to assert that the reason they are asking for direct nominations is that they have done such a sterling job.In any case, if you do a sterling job, you do not need anybody to favour you: It automatically gives you the possibility of being reelected.My final point is that ODM as a party must make sure that the mistakes they have been made in the past must not be repeated again. First, the nominations were a sham. Very many candidates who were popular on the ground were denied the ticket by their party and they then had to go looking for the peripheral parties to get a ticket to enable them to contest the election.We thus have a number of cases very well known and the details are in the public domain of candidates for various positions who were first denied the ODM ticket and then went on to obtain tickets from parties as diverse as PDP and Ford Kenya, and then managed to win the seat they were vying for.My point then is this: Let us make sure there is real fairness in allowing people to run for political office on a level playing field. The public will then decide who they want to represent them. For the public knows very well who we all are as their leaders. The public fully understands who is stealing money right now.If an elected leader says, We have spent two billion shillings doing Project A or Project B , the public knows whether that money has been properly spent or not.MP, Kitutu Chache South
