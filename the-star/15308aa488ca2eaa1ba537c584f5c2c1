So why is an internal auditor seconded to the Health ministry being fought so hard? Sources at the Treasury whisper to Corridors the man, who recently audited the Kenyatta National Hospital, has unearthed massive graft. We are told salaries for April, May and June meant for KNH staff passed through the ministry and was used to pay suppliers under questionable circumstances. The said auditor also discovered suspicious payments of a staggering Sh500 million to a local bank, without the name of the receiving institution being indicated. The massive graft touches on top Jubilee administration officials, both at the Health ministry and the Treasury. It s said the auditor was almost transferred by the cartel, when Health CS Cleopa Mailu (pictured) was away in New York for the UNGA meeting. More surprising is that a senior official named in the scandal invokes the name of President Uhuru Kenyatta in his dirty dealings. It s only a matter of time before the scandal unfolds in the most gruesome fashion - just like the NYS chronicle. ***********A number of Nandi farmers are a frustrated lot. They have read as a bad omen the ambitions of an individual, aspiring for governor and who recently helped them get free artificial insemination. Some farmers say they are mourning because all their cows aborted their calves, a few months into conception. They now want the EACC to investigate the man, who was removed from his lucrative government job on account of corruption. They believe he acquired the semen irregularly during his time in office. Those in the know say the man has been nicknamed Hot Potato and that, after the semen incident, his fortunes have dwindled and he is now regarded as more of a stale potato.************ A woman who oversees the operations of a private security firm at the Milimani law courts has taken it upon herself to intimidate police officers who visit the courts on a daily basis. The woman has been harassing the men in uniform and demanding they leave their firearms in a steel box at the gate. This is despite concerns that such an arrangement risks the lives of court users, in case of an attack or attempt by criminals to rescue their accomplices. Police officers now wonder who protects the woman.****************One CS is a man living in hell at home. His overbearing wife controls everything he does. The woman talks down all state employees and visitors. Corridors has it she has ensured her man is driven directly to their Karen home after work. She monitors his movements from the time he leaves the house. Recently, she dismissed him in front of clan elders who came to solve their dispute. The disappointed wazee walked out on the CS and swore never to return.
