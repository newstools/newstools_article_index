Muhoroni Youth host Mathare United as the Sportpesa Premier League resumes today after the international break.The dark storm has been hovering above Muhoroni Youth for much of the second leg following the much publicised fallout between the playing unit and the club s top management.Today, Muhoroni will be looking to put the crisis firmly behind them as they confront the slum boys.For most of the first leg, Muhoroni were considered title dark horses but misunderstandings have seen them fall off the top half of the table and now coach Bobby Ogolla will be looking at least to steer them back into the top eight.They will have to do that without top scorer and controversial forward Wycliffe Ochomo, who was suspended from the club for his alleged role in fomenting a rift within the club. For goals, they will have to look up to veteran forward Francis Ocholla who on his day takes some stopping.Mathare too had loftier ambitions when the season began with the appointment of Francis Kimanzi. The 2008 champions had hoped to be challenging for the title but with five matches left to play, they face a 10-point gap to topple the current leaders. Club s CEO Jacktone Obure conceded in Monday television show that they have now modified their target to a top tree finish in spite of the tough fixtures ahead of them. We have been largely consistent this season and have been in the top five for the most part of the season. Our target now is to finish in the top three and I know our players are up to the task despite the difficult games we have away at Chemelil Sugar and Gor Mahia, Obure said. To attain what now looks like a modest objective, victory today against Muhoroni is a must for Kimanzi s men.Three young forwards Eric Johanna, Whyvonne Isuza and Daniel Mwaura will be key to unlock the experienced Muhoroni back-line. Also for Muhoroni nothing short of three points will enable them to return into the top eight in the league standings.With their 33 points, they are two behind Kakamega Homeboyz, who occupy the last slot in the top half of the sixteen-team top flight division. Victory for Mathare will see them leapfrog both Western Stima and Chemelil who occupy third and foruth places respectively with 40 and 39 points.
