Cord leader Raila Odinga has urged county governments to be accountable in their services.He warned the counties against misappropriating public funds in the name of benchmarking trips abroad. Raila spoke at Pwani University in Kilifi, when he officially opened the Kilifi International Investment Conference yesterday.He said as the opposition fights for counties to get a bigger share of the national revenue, they must shun corruption and provide better services to the public. We will support your push to get at least 45 per cent allocation of the national revenue, but we do not want devolved corruption. Service delivery remains your best bet. If your county government delivers better services, people will demand devolution of more powers and resources, he said.
