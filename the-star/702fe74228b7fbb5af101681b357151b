A Ford Kenya member wants the party to conduct elections, saying the current national office led by Moses Wetang ula have overstayed in office.Ken Wafula, the party s interim chairman in Trans Nzoia county, yesterday said the last time the party held an election was in 2011.The party constitution provides that new officials should be elected every four years, he said. The elections are long overdue. The members want elections but the leadership is not committed. The fifth year is ending, yet there are no signs of an election anytime soon, Wafula said yesterday. This could mean Wetang ula holds the party leader position illegally. The fact that the party leader has been constituting the party s National Executive Council unilaterally may also compound the problems that face Ford Kenya.Wetang ula recently picked his key ally Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale as his deputy to replace Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani, who defected to Jubilee. But Wafula termed the move irregular.Turkana Senator John Munyes has also left the party for Jubilee.According to Wafula, only the General Council, with a membership of 450 and the 1,400-member National Delegates Conference, are responsible for the constitution of the party s NEC. The NDC is the highest policy organ of the party. In its lifetime, it s supposed to meet twice, but has never met since 2011, he said.The party s NDC nominates the presidential candidate.Wetang ula has claimed that his party has already endorsed him as its presidential candidate.The General Council on the other hand is mandated to meet every year, but has never met.The NEC, the engine that drives the affairs of the party, is required to meet on a quarterly basis, but has not met for years, Wafula said.
