Elders from Garissa county have urged the national government to rescue residents from drought. The call comes a week after Governor Nathif Jama made a similar appeal and declared the six-month drought a county disaster.The elders said livestock in Fafi, Ijara and Lagdera subcounties have started dying of hunger. Dubat Hamey, national chairman of the Kenya Livestock Marketing Council, said herders from Lagdera have crossed over to neighbouring Isiolo county.Those from Fafi and Ijara have moved to Lamu and Tana River counties, while others have crossed the border to southern Somalia in search of pasture and water, he said. The elders addressed the press in Garissa town on Monday evening. When you see this kind of migration, then it is an indication that the situation is dire. If the herders can risk moving to southern Somalia, despite the threat of al Shabaab, then the situation is not good, Hamey said.The former Garissa county chairman said the county government cannot cope with the drought and urged the national government to provide relief food to save people s lives.He urged the pastoralist communities to co-exist peacefully and share the available pasture and water. The recent conflict in Isiolo was unwarranted, Hamey said.
