A cleric has urged Kenyans to avoid divisive politics, as the country heads to the next general election. Speaking on Sunday, Bishop Wilber Gogo (pictured) of Gospel Revival Center called on Kenyans to boycott campaign rallies because they already know the people they will vote for. Gogo said leaders are good friends, yet their supporters continue hating one another.
