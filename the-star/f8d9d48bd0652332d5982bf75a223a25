We are not tribalist and all we want is due process in the appointment process. If Kosgey led during the interviews then he should be given the job on merit not because he is a Kalenjin," Mandago said.He said his sentiments were recorded and at no time did he make tribal outbursts against Prof Ayiro.Read: Moi University students condemn protests by Mandago against acting VC Ayiro hiring The university will also hold another graduation ceremony on Friday, from which a total of 5,000 students will be according various degrees.Moi University Chancellor Prof Miriam Khamadi, who presided over the Thursday event, said the institution's administration must accommodate all communities.She asked them to strengthen cohesiveness among residents of the region, adding that the university was a national institution.Prof Khamadi welcomed the appointment of Prof Ayiro."Moi University is home to all Kenyans and we must nurture cohesion.
