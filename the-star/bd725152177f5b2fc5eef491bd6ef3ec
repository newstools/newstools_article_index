Ben Gethi, a businessman implicated in Sh791 million NYS scandal, has said he is being victimised by prominent suspects mentioned in the saga.Gethi told the Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday that he had worked with the National Youth Service for five years before the scandal broke.He refuted claims that his Horizon company only secured NYS contracts during former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru and NYS director general Nelson Githinji's tenure."I am just but a victim of office politics because I had been doing business with the service years before the scandal," he said."Most of the accusations amount to nothing more than hearsay and passing of information from one person to another, and finally to the whole of Kenya, There is no link to corrupt intentions adduced against me."Gethi further said his business was confined to Horizon's supply of fuel, and that this was clear in logs for payments for delivered goods and services.The businessman also said he was not questioned by the CID over his alleged involvement in the scam. He further noted that his businesses were not closed over the alleged theft of public money.Gethi said he had never met his co-accused, Nairobi businesswoman Josephine Kabura, before the saga, adding the two of them had never done business together."I had not met Kabura and documents tabled in court show she is the sole owner of companies which were the alleged beneficiaries of the Sh791 million," he said."I only knew her after being served with the charge sheets. I first met her first on July 21, 2015 at Marshals building 2015."Gethi blamed Waiguru, saying she interferred with the NYS programme and left no room for independent investigations into the scandal."I can deduce that Waiguru was interfering with investigations and her stating the same shows a biased opinion meant to sway decisions on the purposed fraud and theft," he said.Read: How Ben Gethi, 31, Spent Sh585 million NYS cashAlso read: Ben Gethi worth Sh3 billion, claims his biggest NYS tender was for Sh50 millionGethi was charged with money laundering in August, alongside Kabura and nine others.The eight were accused of colluding to wire the amount from NYS coffers and using part of it to purchase property through phony companies.They allegedly committed the offences between December 1, 2014 and March 2015.They denied 15 counts of money laundering and were released on Sh300,000 cash bail of Sh1 million bond each.More on this: 11 NYS scandal suspects charged with money laundering
