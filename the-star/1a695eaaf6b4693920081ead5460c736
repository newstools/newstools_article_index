Kenyan Afro funky house artiste Kagwe Mungai is definitely a favorite when it comes to the ladies.While most ladies still have hope in their heart that the 26-year old is still out there and ready to mingle, a certain picture that we have in our possession seems to state otherwise.The Creeper hit maker was photographed in his bathrobe with a mystery girl who doesn&rsquo;t seem to be wearing much either, and they seem pretty cozy and familiar with each other.&nbsp;It could be nothing but you know what they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.What do you think? Is Kagwe officially off the market much to the displeasure of many hopefuls or is this just a ploy?If he really is involved with someone, who is she?Kagwe has remained silent about the speculations and was unreachable at the time of publishing this piece.&nbsp;
