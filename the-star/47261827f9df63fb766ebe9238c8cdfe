Former Devolution CS Anne Waiguru will not be gagged over her continued public statements regarding the NYS scandal.Yesterday, a court declined to restrain Waiguru from commenting on the case. There is no proof to support the claim that the former CS has been making prejudicial statements. No extracts of media clips or anything have been tabled before me. The court is therefore not able to establish the allegations, Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku said.Suspects in a money laundering case arising from the Sh791 million NYS theft said Waiguru is using the case to seek political mileage.
