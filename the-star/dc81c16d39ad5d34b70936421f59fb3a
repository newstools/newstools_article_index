A defiant Donald Trump on Sunday said Hillary Clinton would go to jail if he were president and attacked her husband for his treatment of women in a vicious presidential debate less than a month before the US election.Their debate, the second of three before the November 8 vote, was remarkable for the brutal nature of the exchanges between Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and Clinton, his Democratic rival.He called her a "devil" who repeatedly lies, someone with tremendous hate in her heart. She called him an abuser of women.There was a palpable sense of mutual contempt as they stood on stage, refusing to shake hands at the start. Moderators Anderson Cooper of CNN and Martha Raddatz of ABC both seemed at points to be grimly watching two trains collide.Through it all, Trump, 70, and Clinton, 68, both landed punches as they clashed over taxes, healthcare, US policy in the Syria civil war and Clinton's comments that half of Trump's supporters belonged in a "basket of deplorables."Trump took the stage in St. Louis, Missouri, at the most perilous time of his 16-month-old candidacy.Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during the presidential town hall debate with Democratic US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (not pictured) at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, US, October 9, 2016. /REUTERSA newly uncovered 2005 video of him making vulgar remarks about women prompted a stampede of Republican politicians to abandon him, deepened fissures with establishment party figures, and seemed to many in the party to put his already uphill battle to win the White House even farther out of reach.Clinton 57 pct, Trump 34 pctA CNN/ORC snap poll of debate watchers found that 57 per cent thought Clinton won the encounter, versus 34 per cent for Trump. Asian shares crept higher and the Mexican peso climbed on Monday as markets saw less chance of a Trump victory.Even after the debate, party leaders remained concerned that Trump had not shown enough contrition over the sexually aggressive remarks to win over independents and women voters who could decide the election.He again described the comments as "locker-room talk" and said he had never kissed or groped women without their permission, despite having bragged about doing so on the video which emerged on Friday.President Bill Clinton had done worse to women, Trump said in one of several forceful attacks that may reinforce his popularity with his core supporters who detest the Democratic nominee.Hillary Clinton responded that Trump's comments showed he was unfit for the White House."He has said the video doesn't represent who he is but I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is," Clinton said.She accused Trump of dodging a discussion of policy issues to avoid talking about his campaign because of "the way yours is exploding and Republicans are leaving you."Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathy Shelton (L-R) are seated at the second US presidential debate between Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, US, October 9, 2016. /REUTERSTrump vows prosecutionEarly in the 90-minute debate, Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton's operation of a private email server during her tenure as President Barack Obama's secretary of state from 2009-2013.Clinton said, "You know it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of DonaldTrump is not in charge of the law in this country."

Proud to stand with you..." Indiana Governor Pence said.Responding to an October 1 New York Times story, Trump acknowledged using investment losses to avoid paying taxes, saying "of course I do." The Times reported he took so substantial a tax deduction on a declared $916 million loss in 1995 that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years.Moving freely around the stageThe debate's town hall-style format, with undecided voters posing about half the questions and the debate's moderators posing the others, allowed the candidates to move freely around the stage and address the questioners directly.Clinton and Trump both stood up to answer questions, and Clinton frequently stood directly in front of the questioners to try to connect with voters. At times Trump stood almost over her shoulder, or wandered the stage, while she spoke.Republican US presidential nominee Donald Trump listens as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton answers a question from the audience during their presidential town hall debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, US, October 9, 2016. /REUTERSClinton defended her statement in which she said half of Trump's supporters were part of a "basket of deplorables.""Within hours I said I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my problem is not with his supporters, it's with him," Clinton said.Trump, in a badgering tone, offered a blistering critique of Clinton's handling of foreign policy as secretary of state, repeatedly calling it a failure.Taking a breath through his nose with a loud sniff, he said, "The fact is almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and a disaster."Asked at the end to name one thing each admired about the other, Clinton said she respected his children for their ability and devotion to Trump. In response, Trump called her a fighter and said he admired her for her refusal to give up.As the moderators announced the end of the debate, the two candidates turned toward each other and shook hands.Their next and last debate is on October 19.
