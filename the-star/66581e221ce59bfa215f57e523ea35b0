Political storm is looming in Nyandarua as the Jubilee Party takes shape as the sole political giant.Officials of the now-defunct TNA party, led by chairman Michael Mbugua, secretary Wahome Ndegwa and coordinator Chuaga Ndung u have moved to stamp their authority as bona fide leaders.On Monday the officials met at Jubilee offices in Tumaini Plaza, Ol Kalou. There is no vacuum in leadership.TNA simply rebranded, Mbugua said. Ndegwa said the new Jubilee constitution does not allow party elections at the moment. The transitional clause, he said, stipulates that former party officials and party strength will be considered. Since TNA held 99.9 per cent stake in Nyandarua, those who have purportedly elected themselves are wallowing in self-deception, he said.A group allegedly led by former Nyandarua Kanu chairman Kimani Gakenia and Naphtali Mureithi, a Kinangop parliamentary seat aspirant, has been holding meetings around the county, claiming they are the new JP leaders.This has caused fear that Kanu wants to hijack Jubilee affairs in Nyandarua. Political aspirants are also keen to have their point men take prime positions to safeguard their interests. Mbugua said it is wrong for people to appoint themselves as leaders as this contravenes the Jubilee Party constitution. We were issued with the new constitution after the merger at Kasarani.That is the document leaders religiously subscribe to, he said.Ndegwa added, As Jubilee officials, working in collaboration with the party headquarters, we are showing Nyandarua the right path to follow. He said all those interested in Jubilee activities in Nyandarua should work with coordinator Chuaga Ndung u at the branch headquarters at Tumaini Plaza.Ndegwa said Jubilee has 62 seats, which will be shared. TNA, he said, only had 16 officials in Nyandarua, leaving 48 vacant positions to be filled. He urged political brokers salivating for Jubilee leadership to wait for directions from the national headquarters.
