Hassan Joho&nbsp;will lead a two-day rally in Kisumu this weekend &quot;to educate our supporters and Kenyans in general on why Jubilee must not get another term in office&quot;. The Mombasa Governor said the journey to make Uhuru Kenyatta a one-term President began in Mombasa and&nbsp; Nairobi, and will flow through the country. Joho, who is ODM deputy leader, said Uhuru must not go back to office for &quot;dividing the country down the middle, between supporters and non-supporters&quot;. &quot;Jubilee does not deserve a second term because of its deliberate policy of economic sabotage. It has impoverished communities and regions that it perceives to be non-supportive,&quot; he said. Joho further accused the Jubilee government of &quot;stealing from the people and making new promises on top of old ones&nbsp; amid escalated cases of corruption&quot;.&quot;The President is unaware of what Kenyans are going through. If he is aware he does not care. That is why he does not understand why other people are not eating meat while he does,&quot; the Governor told the media.
