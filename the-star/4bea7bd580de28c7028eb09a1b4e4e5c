The magistrate also found that it would be prejudicial to issue a gag order against the former CS since she was not served with the application.Mutuku was of the view that issuing such an order against Waiguru would be tantamount to condemning her without giving her an opportunity to be heard.The magistrate also declined to bar the Parliamentary Accounts Committee from issuing summonses against them."No letters of the alleged summons have been tabled before this court. Such an order can only be issued after the said letters are seen," she said.Through lawyer Maina Wachira, the suspects had accused the former CS of making prejudicial statements in public which end up being published in the media.Wachira had accused Waiguru of using the NYS case to gain favour as she campaigns for the Kirinyaga governor s seat.They had also told court that since they were investigated by police, PAC had no business probing them again.
