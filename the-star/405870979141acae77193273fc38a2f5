SO what did the Kisumu ODM branch officials headed by former MP Ayiecho Olweny do with Sh1.1 million? This is the question ODM supporters are asking after the podium at the Kisumu rally on Saturday nearly caved in with key opposition leaders, including Raila Odinga, on it. The money was a personal donation of Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma for organising the rally. It's said the budget presented by the branch officials indicated that a shamefully weak, small and ugly dais at Kirembe Stadium alone was prepared at a whopping Sh150,000. It's whispered the delivered dais, which collapsed before the rally ended, could hardly cost Sh20,000. There are also complaints they procured a poor-quality sound system and the tents were visibly weak. There was also no water for VIPs, despite the cost being prominently captured in the budget. So what transpired, Prof Olweny? ODM supporters (and non-supporters) should be told.===================== THE National Police Service Commission wrangles between civilian commissioners and their police counterparts seem to be taking their toll on innocent junior officers. Word has it that the police NPSC commissioners have declined to implement any recommendations approved by their civilian counterparts "to teach them a lesson" - and also to show who is the boss! The police nominees to the NPSC, we are told, have on the other hand refused to confirm the promotion of Kenya Police Spokesman Charles Owino in a tit-for-tat game! Talk of adults behaving badly!======================ON Saturday, a high-profile contingent of professionals, religious leaders and businessmen from Kirinyaga county held a meeting at an upmarket location in Nairobi where they completed their strategic plans of how to show a first-term legislator from the county the wide open door. Our multiple moles who attended the heavily guarded meeting whispered to Corridors that as 2017 beckons, political strategising in the county has taken centre-stage, with opinion leaders, professionals and middle class folk now actively plotting to defeat 'non-performers' and the 'clueless' among sitting MCAs and MPs.=======================TWO Kanu leaders from the Rift Valley who recently defected to the Jubilee Party are an unhappy lot. Reason? The two were overheard lamenting how they were duped by JP operatives that they would each receive a Sh5 million "defection fee" and to facilitate transportation of their delegates. To their surprise, they only received Sh100,000 in one white envelope.
