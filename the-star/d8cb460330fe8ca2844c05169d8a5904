President Uhuru Kenyatta has challenged Kenyans, including the media, to focus on projecting the country in a positive light. We have to change our mindset about our own country. Kenyans sometimes are the most negative about their country even when foreigners are positive about Kenya, he said. The President was speaking at State House, Nairobi, when he addressed a Youth Summit organised by the Presidential Communication team and the Public Service ministry. Public Service CS Sicily Kariuki said her ministry is reviewing the National Youth Policy to effectively address problems facing the youth. Investing in the young people is not only right, but is also the smart thing to do, she said. Kariuki said her ministry, through the Affirmative Action Empowerment Programmes, has enabled the youth to engage in viable economic activities.
