Maragua MP Peter Kamande has demanded for an explanation from Athi Water Board and Murang'a Governor Mwangi wa Iria over a scheme to provide piped water to residents as part of the Norther Water Collector Tunnel project.Kamande said that during a meeting at Golden Palm hotel in Kenol in 2014 and attended by several leaders from the county, it was agreed that Athi Water services Board would finance major piping from source and the county government would take over to distribute to the homesteads."I have a feeling that these funds were pocketed by top County officials since the trenches for major pipes along the road have already been done by a Chinese company and financed by Athi Water as minuted in the Golden Palm Meeting," Kamande said.He was speaking at Flyover ACK Church in Maragua yesterday.Cord leader Raila Odinga last week opposed the tunnel project, saying it would dry rivers that flow into lower eastern and parts of coast. Athi Water Board however says the tunnel would collect only 40 percent of excess flow when there is heavy rainfall. Local MPs have said they support the project on condition that Muranga residents get piped water to their homes.Kamander however says more transparency is needed."Let the Governor and Athi water tell us how much was allocated and how was it spent," he addedKamande also said it was wrong for leaders to advance their personal interest when Murang'a people are in dire need of water.
