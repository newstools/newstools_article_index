The focus on election preparedness will highlight the critical role of the National Assembly in securing peaceful elections and safeguarding Kenya s economic momentum, Kepsa said in a statement.The move is part of Kepsa s efforts to abate losses incurred by the business community during electioneering periods as a result of violence, as witnessed in 2007-08. Our focus has been on proposing recommendations on amendments that enhance reforms in Kenya s business environment, Kepsa chairman Dennis Awori said.He said the forum provides a structured framework for engagement with parliamentary departmental committees, through which the private sector has proposed amendments to bills coming before the National Assembly that impact on the business environment. The roundtable is supported by Parliament. "We hope this forum will offer a chance to have a structured engagement through meaningful and constructive deliberations with the private sector for the benefit of the Kenyan people especially on legislation that is to come before the floor of the house," speaker Justin Muturi said.Kepsa CEO Carole Kariuki said Kepsa recognises the role of the national assembly in enacting laws that secure Kenya s economic and development interests.To date, the roundtable has achieved a number of results including enactment of the limited liability partnership Act, the partnership Act, the insolvency Act; the Capital Markets Act, and the Special Economic Zones Act.Others are the public private partnership Act, business services regulation Act and companies Act.
