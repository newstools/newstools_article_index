Most projects launched by the Kakamega government in education and health are 75 per cent complete, Deputy Governor Philip Kutima has said.Kutima said a report by an ad hoc committee appointed by Governor Wycliffe Oparanya to establish the status of the programmes shows most buildings are at the roofing stage.He said the county teaching and referral hospital whose construction began in June this year is 35 per cent done. The main challenge is delayed disbursement of funds by the National Treasury which slows down the implementation of the projects, Kutima said. The deputy governor chairs the County Monitoring and Evaluation Committee. He said the ad hoc committee chaired by county Chief of Staff Nabii Nabwera visited 651 project sites at different stages of implementation. Oparanya hopes to get reelected on account of his first term s development record. On Thursday he said pioneer governors spent the better part of the first term setting up structures to implement devolution, and deserve a second term to enable them to complete what they started.Major projects by the Kakamega government in health include the construction of the Shamakhubu Subcounty Hospital in Shinyalu, Mumias Subcounty Hospital in Mumias West and the county teaching and referral hospital in Lurambi subcounty.
