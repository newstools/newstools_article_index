Women have been urged to form groups, take loans from the government and start development projects. Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organisation national chairperson Rahab Mwikali (pictured) said women at the grassroots have not been playing their part in nation building. Speaking in Lamu, she said for Kenya to win the war on hunger and poverty, all citizens, including women, should play their part. This is not the time for women to laze around, waiting for men to bring the bacon home. Women must rise and play their part for this nation to move forward. The government provides a kitty, where women can borrow money and improve their lives. Let us all make use of such funds, Mwikali said. She urged the women not to shy away from contesting for political seats. She said women leadership is powerful.
