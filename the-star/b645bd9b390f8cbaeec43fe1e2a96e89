The ODM central management committee has approved the proposal for Cord to conduct joint nominations for the 2017 elections.The committee led by party leader Raila Odinga acts as a think- tank and advises the National Executive Committee on policy issues. Yesterday, it approved the proposal, fronted by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, that Cord parties ODM, Wiper and Ford Kenya conduct a joint nominations for all elective seats.The committee s resolution will have to be approved by the ODM National Executive Council. Then it will be tabled before the Cord management committee, meeting in Naivasha, for approval or rejection. We agreed that as a coalition we hold a retreat in Naivasha to agree on how the nominations should be handled, a source said.Among the issues to be discussed during the retreat is a proposal by Ford Kenya that zoning be done to restrict parties like ODM from fielding its candidates in Western Kenya.Ford Kenya is perceived to enjoy support in Western Kenya because its party leader and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang ula and his deputy, Senator Boni Khalwale (Kakamega), come from the region. However, Ford Kenya has fewer parliamentary seats in the region, compared to ODM. This may complicate its desire to field its own candidates.Khalwale s campaign to unseat ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya as Kakamega governor may also complicate matters.At the Coast, Mombasa Senator and Wiper secretary general Hassan Omar is challenging ODM deputy party leader Hassan Joho as governor. These are some of the things we will be discussing to ensure we don t split our votes in favour of Jubilee. It happened in 2013 and once bitten twice shy. It s something we cannot allow, the source said.
