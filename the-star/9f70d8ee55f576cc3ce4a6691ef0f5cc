Budalangi MP Ababu Namwamba will table a special motion in Parliament for Western's Dini ya Msambwa to be compensated for their fight for independence.Ababu asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to ensure Jubilee Party's 'Tuko Pamoja' slogan is applied in compensating all freedom fighters."I am going to table the motion when Parliament resumes next month for Dini ya Msambwa to be compensated too," he said on Sunday."The compensation must be applied for all Kenyans who were tortured by the British colonial forces, not only those from Mt Kenya."Elijah Masinde, Dini ya Musambwa founder, is said to have made several prophesies during his lifetime.But the one that stood out was delivered to Kenya s founding President Jomo Kenyatta when both were in detention at Kapenguria.Masinde, who often found himself at odds with the government of the day due to his abrasive approach to issues, was locked up together with Kenyatta following a spat with the colonial authorities.At Kapenguria, it is said that he managed to forewarn Kenyatta of an impending assassination plot.Although there are accounts of attempts on Kenyatta s life, not much is known about Masinde s warning since he did not put timelines to the prophecy. He also claimed to have had a vision.Britain pledged to spend Sh2.6 billion on compensation for abuses experienced at that time.This was after 5,228 Mau Mau veterans seeking compensation from the British government won their case in 2013.They decided to settle out of court, an arrangement that will see each litigant receive about Sh3,400.Thousands of people were killed in the 1950s during the Mau Mau revolt against British rule in Kenya.
