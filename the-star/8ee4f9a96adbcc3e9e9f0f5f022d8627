Few teams have inflicted more misery on AFC Leopards than Ulinzi Stars in recent years and today, the soldiers will hope to dish out more pain on a reeling Ingwe side that has little to show for another lacklustre campaign.Leopards might be hoping to appoint a new coach before the year ends with as many as 20 coaches from all over the world having reportedly sent in their CVs but for their fans, the reality is that it will not make any difference this year as Ingwe are out of the running in all competitions and might still miss out on a top eight finish.That is unless they end their run of five matches without victory that has seen them lose to Western Stima, Kakamega, Homeboyz and Bandari to stand just 12 points above the bottom two with five matches left to play.Ulinzi on the other hand, still have an outward chance of winning the SportPesa Premier League title with 11 points separating them from top spot. The soldiers might also complete an unlikely double should they also win the GOtv Shield when they face league leaders Tusker in the final next week, having eliminated Leopards in the quarter-finals stage.Former Ulinzi captain Stephen Ochollah has urged the team to fight on in the remaining games of the season and ensure a respectable finish.Ochollah, who has been away for the whole season attending to duties of his first call as a soldier, has tipped the boys to win the GOtv Shield and has told them to do it for ailing coach Robert Matano. If not for anything else, they should do it for the coach. He has done so much for us and we deserve to award him with something. The team is in the running for a title this season in the GOtv Shield and the players should give their best for him, Ochollah said on the club official website. In the remaining games of the season as well, they should win to see the team finish well on the standings and finish the good job Matano started. He deserves it. I have been keenly following up on the progress of the team and I am impressed with how much the team has grown. From all this distance, I still hold the team at heart, the midfielder noted.Victory for Ulinzi today will push them to within eight points off the brewers while three points for Leopards will improve their hopes of finishing at least in the top eight and end any mathematical possibility of them fending of relegation.
