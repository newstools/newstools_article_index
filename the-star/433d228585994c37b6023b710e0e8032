SPOT: KIZINGONI BEACHWHERE TO STAY: Kizingoni Beach KabanasMUST DO: Watersports like snorkelling, swimming with dolphins, turtle tracking and deep sea fishing. Equipment including water skis, kayaks, wake boards and SUP boards are available. Private, romantic, luxurious and remote, we were the only guests on this secluded 24-acre stretch of magnificent golden sandy beach on the South West tip of the Lamu Archipelago. It has six single and one double cabana, and I stayed in one called High Tide which is beachfront and nestled within indigenous trees and shrubs. It has a living area with swinging daybeds below and upstairs is a double netted bed extravagantly accessorized with unique Swahili items and rustic intricately curved fittings. The striking blue door leading in is one to behold and would blend in just as well on a street in Marrakech, Morocco. The terrace offers a panoramic view of the beach along which you will spot a few fishermen bringing in their catch from Kipunguni, speed boats and a luxury dhow begging to have you aboard as well as a donkey that can take you into the dunes. Each cabana has a private chef and rest assured that they will meticulously whip you up a fantastic array of the freshest seafood, salads, juices, local cuisine, sorbets- whatever you desire, really.
