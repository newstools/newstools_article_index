Reigning Kenya Cup champions Kabras Sugar have released former Ugandan international trio of James Odong, Gerald Ssewankambo and Charles Uhuru after the expiry of their two-year contracts.Kabras Sugar team manager, Anthony Ogot, said the players had requested for the release as they are keen to rejoin their former club Buffaloes back in Uganda after having had a success stint with the sugarmen. As team manager, I always tell my players to follow their hearts. The three wanted to go back to Uganda and as a result, we couldn t extend their contracts. We can t do much as a club but we wish them well, he said. They will definitely leave a gap in the team, but with the large player-base in camp there, will always be people who can fit in their shoes. Ogot also hinted that they are negotiating contracts of the new players ahead of the coming Kenya Cup season. The three Ugandan players played a key role in the club back in 2015 when the club stunned the then defending champions Nakuru RFC to reach the final of the Kenya Cup season but succumbed to eventual winners KCB.
