Jubilee Party has told off the opposition on vote rigging saying this can only happen if they are careless.National Steering committee co-chairman Noah Wekesa said elections management has improved in the 21st century. He said sophisticated technology ensures polls are free and fair."Candidates must train their agents, ensure they understand the election process and position them in all polling stations," he told the Star in a phone interview on Wednesday.Wekesa added that the country has enough competent institutions with laws strong enough for elections.Noting rigging amounts to corruption, he said: "We want Jubilee to be in place for the next 100 years. We cannot steal elections but ask our competitors to prepare well in 2017.""Former presidents Mwai Kibaki and Daniel Moi might have stolen elections but it can never happen again."Wekesa said any party that was involved in rigging both internal and general elections "died" since the electorate did not trust it."Jubilee is prepared and I believe the opposition should be prepared so that when we hammer them they accept and move on," he said.Wekesa added Jubilee will capitalise on its immense resources to stage a colourful winning campaign."Being a mass party we have many members who will contribute. We also have friendly businessmen and women who will ensure we have enough resources to campaign," he said.Deputy President William Ruto dismissed in January claims that the Jubilee government is planning to rig the August 8, 2017 election."All these claims you hear about rigging and violence is nothing but propaganda by people who are losing support. Kenyans must ignore them, Ruto said.More on this: Jubilee will comfortably win in 2017 without rigging - William RutoThe DP said this in response to clams by opposition chiefs that the Jubilee Coalition was laying the groundwork to steal the polls.Cord announced they will conduct a lifestyle audit of Deputy President William Ruto and accused him of splashing around public cash to buy opposition MPs to join government.Read: Jubilee plans to rig 2017 polls - RailaAlso read: Jubilee Party harvests 39 opposition governors, MPsOpposition chief Raila Odinga assured his support base in February that it will not be possible to rig him out of next year's presidential contest.Apart from running a parallel electronic vote tallying system, Raila and the Cord team plan to train and deploy party agents in every polling station across the country.The agents will be equipped with mobile phones and will take and transmit to the national tallying centre images of every result announced in streams.
