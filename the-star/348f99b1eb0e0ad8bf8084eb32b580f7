Julius Sunkuli, former Minister / He is said to have enjoyed immense power during the last years of President Daniel arap Moi s tenure, with some critics saying he behaved like a Prime MinisterJulius Sunkuli served as an altar boy and had his sights trained on becoming a Catholic priest, but his life took a rather different turn.He hails from a humble background: His parents Francis and Hellen Sunkuli took him and his younger siblings to the Kilgoris Catholic Church, where he admired the priests and believed that one day he would grow up to serve his people as a priest due to their dedication to serving the local residents.This was never to be. After completing secondary school he joined the University of Nairobi to study Law instead. On completion he was employed as a magistrate and posted to the Kericho Law Courts, where his interests changed. He had the ambition of growing to the highest level possible in the Judiciary. I was certain that I would one day rise up to be a judge in the Court of Appeal and most likely Chief Justice; politics was the last thing on my mind until elders from my Maasai community approached me and said that they wanted me as their next Member of Parliament - it was 1992, says Sunkuli.It took a lot of convincing by elders from his Moitanik Clan for him to resign from the Judiciary and join the race for the Kilgoris parliamentary seat then held by Francis Sompisha, who had been legislator for the area for 24 years.He was elected the MP for the then Narok West Constituency at the age of 31 years and held the seat for 10 years, rising from an Assistant Minister in the Office of the President in charge of Internal Security and Provincial Administration in 1993 to Cabinet Minister in the same ministry in1999.Sunkuli is said to have enjoyed immense power during the last years of President Daniel wrap Moi s tenure, with some critics saying he behaved like a Prime Minister, something that made him attract friends and enemies in equal measure across the country, which eventually worked for his downfall at the 2002 general election.The former Cabinet minister regrets having to compete against his flamboyant younger brother Andrew Sunkuli for the Narok Senate seat in 2013.He now feels that was the worst mistake they made since if one of them had vied for the seat, he could have won since their combined votes were more than 120,000.The former Cabinet minister is currently preparing himself to run for the Kilgoris parliamentary seat that he lost to retired KDF Colonel Gideon Konchellah, who has been the area MP for three straight terms.He says that this time round he is assured of capturing this seat at the 2017 general election.In five minutesThe altar boy who became a powerful Cabinet minister1961: Born in the Poroko area of Trans Mara West subcounty, Narok county.1981: Completed his A-Level studies at Cardinal Otunga High School, Kisii county.1985: Completed his Bachelor of Law Degree studies at the University of Nairobi.1987: Joined the Judiciary as a District Magistrate in Kericho.1992: Elected Narok West Member of Parliament.1993: Appointed Assistant Minister Office of the President in the docket of Internal Security and Provincial Administration.1997: Re-elected Kilgoris Member of Parliament and re-appointed Assistant Minister in the Office of the President.1999: Appointed Cabinet minister Office of the President in charge of Internal Security.2009: Appointed Kenya Ambassador to China.Quotes2012: My conscience is clear.
