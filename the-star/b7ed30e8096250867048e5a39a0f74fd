Primary school head teachers have been told to ensure KCPE exam candidates avoid errors when shading multiple choice answer sheets during examinations.Kenya National Examination Council acting CEO Mercy Karogo has asked the more than 30,000 primary school heads in public and private schools to teach candidates how to write their index numbers, names, school name, shade their school code and responses.Karogo said 182,413 KCPE candidates, out of 927,789, had missing marks in 2015.She said poorly shaded answer sheets are rejected by the computer during marking.This forces Knec officers to revaluate the answer sheets manually to determine the candidate s answers. KCPE answer sheets without errors are marked and completed within 30 days and results ready within the same period, Karogo said.Answer sheets with errors require an extra 15 days to remark, she said.Knec will tomorrow launch preparations for the 2016 KCPE and KCSE examinations. It hopes KCPE candidates and their teachers eradicate errors on answer sheets.This year s KCPE exams start on November 1-3, while KCSE will run from November 7-30. Head teachers should inform all candidates that Knec shall not take responsibility for any errors arising from incorrect use of answer sheets, Karogo said.The examination council has posted the sample answer sheets on its website www.knec.ac.ke.Knec expects head teachers to ensure candidates use a pencil with a dark shade, not biro or ink pens.The rules also demand that candidates stop writing any other mark on answer sheets other than what is required. Candidates should also not soil, tear or fold the answer sheets.
