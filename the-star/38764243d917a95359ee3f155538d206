Nyamira governor hopefuls from Kitutu Masaba constituency have failed to agree on who to front against incumbent John Nyagarama.Former MPs Mwancha Okioma and Walter Nyambati, Charles Mochama, Evans Misati and Ndubi Kinaro have been holding meetings to agree on one candidate to wrest the seat from Nyagrama. I don t think it is possible to agree. We have different interests so we shall meet at the ballot, Nyambati said. He is Nyamira Jubilee Party chairman.Nyambati will run against Mochama, lawyer Dennkis Abincha and Erneo Nyakiba for the JP ticket, while Okioma will have to join another party after Ford People dissolved to join JP.Misati, the Progressive Party of Kenya chairman, ruled out stepping down from the race. My party will field candidates for the positions of MCA to governor and I will be on the ballot. It s true we held meetings to explore the possibility of having one candidate, but I don t see it happening, he said. Misati finished third at the March 4, 2013, general election.The battle for the seat has intensified with the entry of John Kumenda, who is also from Kitutu Masaba.Kumenda said he will run on the ODM ticket. He will face Nyagarama, Deputy Governor Amos Nyaribo, West Mugirango MP James Gesami and retired judge David Onyancha for the ticket.Last week, some elders endorsed Kumenda, who said his focus, if elected, will be the tea industry, health, education and infrastructure.Kumenda urged his competitors to adopt issue-based campaigns, free of mudslinging. We should sell our policies peacefully and soberly. Let voters decide the best candidate, he said.Kumenda urged voters to consider hopefuls track record and party manifesto.
