I have only in one&nbsp;occasion&nbsp;left the Office of the President,&quot; said the President. &quot;...Only once when some people took me to some funny court out there and I signed a piece of paper leaving my deputy to act as president,&quot; he said. Uhuru noted on Tuesday that he remains Kenya&#39;s leader no matter where he is, and that this should not be disputed. He said journalists can report whatever they want but that members of the public should not be bothered.

Sonko, who was asked to wind up his speech after talking for more than 10 minutes, began shouting to the master of ceremony telling him to leave him alone. Kenyans on Twitter and leaders accused him of committing treason and asked the government to take action. &quot;When Sonko says he is acting president of the Republic of Kenya and that is legally false...he commits treason..,&quot; said lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi.
