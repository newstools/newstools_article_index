The National Assembly is proposing formation of a select committee to investigate Genetically Modified Organisms. In a motion prepared by Emuhaya MP Wilber Ottichilo, the 17-member committee will investigate and inquire into all matters relating to GMOs.It will review all related research findings and make recommendations.The team will table its report within three months. The motion says while the government banned the importation of GMOs in 2012, no tangible evidence on the dangers has been provided.It adds that there is concern that the National Bio-Safety Authority established under Bio-Safety Act was not involved in the decision to ban the use of GMO foods. The country continues to lose millions of shillings monthly in lost business opportunities related to GMO products. Research on bio-technology and bio-safety has stalled, the motion reads.
