Kiambu county has adopted a low-cost technology to expand its roads.Governor William Kabogo yesterday said nanotechnology and soil enhancing solutions from India and Israel will be used to construct 3,500km of road.Soil Enhancing Solutions capitalises on enzymes to modify roads, irrespective of the soil and is considered environment friendly. Nanotechnology uses chemicals in place of bitumen to construct roads. The county chief said the two technologies have been tested on selected roads in Ruiru and Thika and they were satisfactory.The governor said use of the cheap technology comes at a time when the county is facing financial constraints to expand roads. Israel and India have introduced technologies in constructing durable roads with cheap materials. I m optimistic our county will develop once we construct the network in two years, Kabogo said.Speaking after touring one of the projects in Ruiru, Kabogo said the county will compare the results for the technologies to settle on the best. He said the technologies will reduce the county s road construction and maintenance.Both technologies, Kabogo said, the county has been spending a lot of money in tarmacking roads, especially in Githunguri and Thika towns.Roads executive Njeri Gatabaki said the technologies will improve durability. Infrastructural improvement will also spur economic growth, she said.
