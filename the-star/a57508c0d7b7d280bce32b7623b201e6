The forensic auditor probing the October 13, 2015 collapse of mid-tier Imperial Bank has started piecing together evidence collected over nearly a year to help prosecute those responsible, Central Bank said. CBK governor Patrick Njoroge said investigations into alleged fraud of an estimated Sh39 billion, which have been ongoing since the bank was closed in October 13 last year, have reached a delicate point . US forensic auditor FTI Consulting and Banking Fraud Investigations Department of the Kenya Police have been leading investigations to unearth those behind the alleged 13-year loot from around 2003 arguably the country's largest financial scam ever. The investigation is largely complete and now we are working with prosecution entities and other agencies to cross this bridge safely, Njoroge said on Wednesday. The evidence will help in the recovery of assets and bring those responsible to task. The probe, the CBK has said in the past, has been prolonged from the initial deadline of March after the investigators unearthed evidence equivalent of 1.2 terabytes of data to be interrogated. If this was to be printed on paper, it would accumulate 7,200 kilometres of space an equivalent of distance from Kenya to Tunisia the CBK said in March. Over 700 accounts-of-interest have now been isolated for scrutiny, with some of them connected to a few dozen related accounts, the regulator had said. While initial expectations were that there would be a few dozen accounts-of-interest, some 22,520 high-priority transactions need to be investigated. The prolonged investigations have also meant a spike in the costs, with FTI Consulting reportedly paid about Sh1.5 billion from initial Sh350 million, according to the Business Daily report.
