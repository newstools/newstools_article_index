Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary general Wilson Sossion has urged teachers to keep off schools during national examinations.He said schools should only be left to those working under the Kenya National Examinations Council to oversee the exams.Sossion said there has always been a contradiction on where teachers not directly involved in supervision should be during the exam period.He said teachers assigned various duties by school heads should remain in school during the exams. Our members who will not be contracted by Knec should remain at home during the exams if they are not assigned other duties, Sossion said.heads can t provide securitySossion said head teachers cannot provide security when exam papers are being ferried to their respective examination stations.He said the Education ministry violates teachers rights by requiring them to provide security and it will not be tolerated . It is in law that Knec has the mandate of ensuring exam papers get to the stations. Why is the government then telling teachers to do this job, yet they are not employed by Knec? Sossion said.He said by crafting such a policy, Knec is looking for someone to blame when cheating takes place.Sossion spoke in Nyeri on Saturday when he attended a fundraiser to settle a Sh2 million hospital bill for the mother of Nyeri Knut branch chairman Patrick Karinga.Sossion urged the government to set aside Sh18 billion to hire 90,000 new teachers and end the current shortage.
