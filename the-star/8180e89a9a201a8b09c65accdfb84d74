Diamond Platnumz manager Sallam Sharaff has demanded an apology from bongo star Ali Kiba.This comes days after Kiba allegedly insinuated that Sallam was involved in 'cutting' short his performance at the Mombasa Rocks Festival last weekend.It was reported that Kiba's microphone was shut down in the middle of his performance and that the Mwana hit singer blamed it on Mendez.He is alleged to have suggested that Sallam had a hand in his misery owing to his "unwarranted" presence at the backstage.However, Sallam defended his presence at the event's backstage, even though his artiste, Diamond, was not present or among the performers.Read: Did Diamond refuse to perform in Malindi because of Ali Kiba?"Me being at the backstage had nothing to do with switching off Ali Kiba's mic."I was there primarily to meet up with Wizkid's management. Wizkid's manager doubles up as Diamond's manager in West Africa and usually when he is in East Africa, we always meet for business and vice versa," he told Mseto's Willy Tuva.He added that it was a matter of common sense that the sound control system was at the frontstage and by so, he couldn't have been able to switch off the singer's mic.Read Also: Ali Kiba's brother accused of shirking responsibilities by his teen baby mama"What I would tell Ali Kiba is to drop the hatred and let us come together in representing East Africa."All he was trying to do is to drag Diamond's name through the mud so as he (Diamond) can be hated by Kenyans."He should personally apologise to me and to Kenyans as well. But even if he doesn't, I have forgiven him already," said Sallam.The music extravaganza was headlined by American R&amp;B star Chris Brown.Read: [VIDEO] This is how Chris Brown rocked Mombasa!A number of other artistes such as Nazizi, Vanessa Mdee, Wizkid and Navio also performed.Rumours are already doing rounds that either Nicki Minaj or Rihanna (both American singers) will headline the event's next edition.
