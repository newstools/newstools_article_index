The High Court on Friday temporarily stopped the Capital Markets Authority from investigating audit firm Ernst and Young in relation to their audit of troubled Uchumi Supermarkets. Justice Joseph Onguto restrained CMA from acting on a notice to show cause letter against the audit firm pending hearing and determination of an application filed at the High Court.CMA s notice to show cause letter is dated August 31 and signed by chief executive Paul Muthaura. It required Ernst and Young to respond to allegations of misconduct by September 24.Through lawyer Ochieng Oduol, the audit firm told Onguto the move is unreasonable and unfair. The lawyer accused CMA of acting on a report by KPMG without facts and without giving it a fair opportunity to respond. The lawyer said the actions by CMA flout the principles of natural justice and fair administrative action.
