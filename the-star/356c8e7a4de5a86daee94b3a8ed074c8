Kenya Film Classification Board chief executive Ezekiel Mutua (pictured) yesterday said he will not surrender his diplomatic passport.The Immigration Department last week announced that Mutua, currently in the US, should surrender his diplomatic passport when he jets back as he does not qualify to hold one.This was followed by a social media outrage after Mutua posted a photo of the passport on his Facebook account. Immigration director general Gordon Kihalangwa said Mutua s passport will be revoked when he returns and issued with an ordinary one.But Mutua said in a statement, The passport is a privilege granted to me by the government in 2012 after I was transferred from the Ministry of Information to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He went on, At no point have I abused or used the Diplomatic passport for personal gain. Mutua said withdrawal of his passport must follow the procedures. I must protest ... the purported revocation of my passport without prior notification, he said.Mutua criticised learning of such a development from the media while abroad, saying it is not embarrassing but unfair. He said the passport was issued legally and procedurally .Last week, the Film Board boss posted a photo of the diplomatic passport saying, ... someone wrote in a local daily that I will never get a visa to the US. Well, I not only got it but it came with a Diplomatic Passport.
