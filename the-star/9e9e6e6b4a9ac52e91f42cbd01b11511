The government has rubbished Raila Odinga's statement on Jubilee's "secret water" project that he said will turn parts of the country into desert.The Cord leader had asked the government to stop the Northern Water Collector Tunnel project terming it a "secret and ridiculous" Jubilee initiative."It was alarmist for the former PM to release the statement in the manner that he did. All feasibility study documents are available," said Water CS Eugene Wamalwa.Wamalwa told a press conference on Monday that the World Bank conducted extensive studies before giving the project the green light."The Sh6.8 billion World Bank project was captured in the Nairobi master plan which the opposition leader launched in September 2012when he was the Prime Minister," he said.The CS further said residents of Muranga, the county government and the National Assembly were consulted.He added that a ruling in a case by some county leaders opposed to the project favoured the government."With the growing population in Nairobi, unless we have proper plans to increase water supply and expand sewerage, we will not be able to cope," he added.Speaking separately, National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale accused Raila of peddling lies concerning the project."Raila thinks he is smart. Since when has he become an environmental expert?" Duale asked at a press conference on Monday.More on this: Jubilee's Sh6.8bn secret water project will turn counties to deserts - RailaThe Garissa town MP said the opposition leader should not be complaining since the project was "his baby"."If there was secrecy then he was the originator of that secrecy. The project was initiated by the Grand Coalition Government and the speaker was Raila," said Duale."He lives in propaganda and lies. The more you do that the more Kenyans become disappointed with the kind of leadership you have."The majority leader claimed Raila was only diverting the public's attention from what is happening in his Cord coalition."Raila is under siege. His house is burning because he has cheated Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for too long and he wants to cheat him some more," said Duale."He is crying for 10 per cent of his share of the project and he is not telling Kenyans."Read: Cord faces split over 2017 ticket: Raila, Kalonzo, Wetang'ula fighting for coalition ticketAt his presser on Monday, Raila said the secrecy surrounding the tunnel project funded by the World Bank was by design.He said Jubilee conceptualised, commissioned and commenced construction of the project without establishing the impact of the same on the environment.Raila added that it will be one of the most disastrous initiatives as it will turn Muranga, Garissa, Ukambani and Tana River Delta regions into deserts, within five years of completion.The project, which kicked off in March and is expected to conclude in December 2017, is supposed to improve water services in Nairobi, Kiambu and Murang'a counties.Read: Which way for Kenya's biggest water project?Also read: Kigumo residents want tunnel moved
