Unilever East Africa says the recent relaunch of its 30-year old food additive, Royco, was necessary after it incorporated natural sun-dried ingredients to retain health-conscious consumers. Our insights show that consumers are more conscious of healthy eating than past generations, Unilever marketing director Agnes Kitololo said in a statement. They are also more interested in finding food adventures; food that delivers a new flavour or new take on healthy indulgences. The 2016 Food Trends Report by international research firm Global Food Forum shows that food that deliver on both health and convenience is gaining wider distribution as consumers are keen on good-for-you products.
