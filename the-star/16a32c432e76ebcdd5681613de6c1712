Former LSK chairman and Mwingi Central MP aspirant Eric Mutua has told residents to elect leaders who are keen on selling their manifesto.He said its shameful for hopefuls to stand in front of residents and start "undressing" members from other parties."Such leaders have no place in Mwingi Central and should not be elected. If they can insult each other when not elected, what about the time they will be elected," Mutua said.He spoke during a meet-the-people-tour in Sosoma, Ngooni, Myuuni, Musovo and Ukasi."We need peaceful elections and whoever loses should be contented and wait. It's not a matter of life and death, since elections will always be there," Mutua said.
