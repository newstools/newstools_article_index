Last week a group of Kenyan MPs threatened to bring a motion to Parliament banning the leaders of South Sudan from Kenya, deporting their families and freezing their assets.They argue the leaders are destabilising the country from the comfort of peaceful cities, including Nairobi.The solution is more comprehensive than that. The peace process has stalled because some parties say it cannot be implemented.South Sudan s conflict requires a political solution, yet the talks for this in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, seem to be going nowhere.Kenya played a key role in nurturing South Sudan into a new nation, and it is time it offered a leadership role again to end the current conflict.The talks should be moved from Ethiopia to Kenya. Former Botswana President Festus Mogae has not achieved much as the chairperson of the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission. Another JMEC mediator may be needed to push the parties to talk without rest until an agreement is reached.
