A group of Taita Taveta traditional dancers has expressed concern that they might miss out on the third edition of Kenya Week at the Unesco headquarters in Paris, France.The celebrations, which will be held between October 10 and 14, are expected to be officially opened by Deputy President William Ruto.The Gonda ya Bara Isanga Cultural Dance Troupe, which performed during the Kenya National Commission for Unesco celebration in Machakos earlier this month, was recognised for its exemplary performance and was invited to the Paris event.However, it says the Taita government has not shown any interest in facilitating the team s travel since they received the invitation letter on September 6.Joseph Mwasi, the chairperson of the dancers, yesterday said in Mombasa Governor John Mruttu s administration is not willing to help them. In a letter sent to Mruttu (pictured), Knatcom said Gonda ya Bara Isanga s performance in Machakos was exemplary and it qualified to represent Taita Taveta in Paris. The purpose of this letter is to invite you and your team to the third edition of Kenya Week at Unesco Headquarters in Paris, reads part of the letter. We further request your county to kindly cater for travel, accommodation and subsistence cost for your participants. But Mwasi said the county has refused to help the 16-member team. They say they do not have the money to facilitate our travel. We feel they don t want us to go for the event, he said. Former Voi MP Basil Mwakiringo has urged the county to support culture and talent. It s shameful for a county to say that they cannot cater for the Sh8 million travel cost, he said.
