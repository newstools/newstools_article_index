Residents of Uthiru/Rithimitu ward, Dagoretti South constituency are raising money and engaging private contractors to gravel bad roads in the area.The most affected is Kiuru road, which branches from Muhuri road, off Nairobi-Nakuru Highway towards Kiuru ACK church.Sam British, the residents' mobiliser, said that they chose to raise cash after area leaders declined to respond to their hue and cry on the bad road."We have mobilised for stones, gravel and local youths to work on the road which is impassable whether it rains or not," Sam said.The area is represented by MP Dennis Waweru, who plans to run for Nairobi governor, and MCA John Kinuthia."Last week, we raised Sh10,000 which paid transporters and the local youths. We are filling up the potholes on the road so that it can be passable. We are unable to drive on this road," he said.Residents have also complained of dust that is a source of respiratory diseases.In 2014, MCA Kinuthia said that the Sh20 million ward development fund set aside by Nairobi county government will be prioritised towards repairing damaged roads in the area.At that time, he said that he will use the money to repair Kiuru road, which has been rendered impassable at the moment. Fears are rife that the road might cause more trouble when the rains come in full force in the coming days.This was after many motorists got stuck after the heavy rains that hit most parts of Nairobi last Sunday.The 10km stretch of Muhuri road was recently tarmacked but leaving feeder roads dilapidated.It stretches from 87 Junction in Uthiru, off Nairobi-Nakuru Highway to Dagoretti Market. The road separates Kiambu and Nairobi Counties.A spot check by the Star showed that most of the feeder roads in Kiambu county have been repaired.However, the Nairobi MCAs have blamed delay in the promised Sh20 million ward development funds for the mess. The Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo advised that it was unconstitutional.When contacted, area MP Waweru dismissed the residents and said that the stretch is a small road which will be repaired soon."If the Kenya Rural Roads Authority did a shoddy job, we will revisit the road but residents have to be patient," the MP said.Waweru blamed his political opponents, led by John Kiarie, claiming they were inciting residents over small issues. The residents refute this claim."We have tarmacked so many roads in Dagoretti South. Muhuri road was done to perfection. We are working on others and it's unfair to blame us when we are working," he said.
