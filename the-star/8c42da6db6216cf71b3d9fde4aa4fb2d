The Kisumu assembly yesterday diverted Sh175 million meant for construction of ward offices to other development projects within the 35 wards.The tenders that had already been advertised will be cancelled.This is after a motion to reallocate the funds, sponsored by East Seme MCA Aggrey Ogosi, was adopted.Ogosi said the Ward Development Fund Management Committee has in the past made attempts to meet procurement procedures for the project, but failed due to competing interests. Given the prevailing circumstances, the construction of the offices cannot be implemented, he said.Ogosi said the money could be used on other projects that do not require elaborate procurement procedures.Meanwhile, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has been asked to investigate the Funds committee over abuse of office.The five-member committee is also expected to step aside or be suspended to allow investigations into the alleged mismanagement of Sh105 million.Some MCAs want the funds diverted to other projects, while others want the ward offices built.Speaker of the Day Pamela Omino ruled that MCAs discuss with residents and within seven days say whether they need the ward offices.In the 2015-16 Budget Estimates, the Ward Development Fund was allocated Sh280 million of which Sh5 million was to be used to build offices in each ward.
