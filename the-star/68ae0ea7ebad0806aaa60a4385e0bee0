Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett has directed the National Cereals and Produce Board to open depots in readiness for maize from the new harvest. This will help mitigate exploitation of farmers by middlemen who take advantage of inadequate markets for farmers. Middlemen have been buying maize in huge quantities and selling it to buyers in Trans Nzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi, which are major maize-growing areas. The board has set aside Sh2 billion to buy cereals from farmers, at Sh2,300 per 90kg bag. We do not want a situation where farmers will be exploited like has been the case in the past. That s why we have asked the NCPB to immediately start buying maize from farmers, Bett said in Eldoret on Friday. Maize imports from Uganda have flooded the market in parts of Rift Valley causing an outcry from farmers over price drop ahead of the harvesting season.
