Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has said he cannot be forced to join Jubilee Party as he is not DP William Ruto's wife.Gideon, who is Kanu chairman, addressed thousands of residents during the Chemususu dam half-marathon in Eldama-Ravine town on Saturday.He said in Kalenjin: Kwani achi korketab arap Ruto sikolazimishana achut chama nebo Jubilee."This loosely translates to: "Am I Ruto s wife to be forced to join Jubilee Party?" Gideon apologised to women before issuing the remark. Korko is a Kalenjin term for married women or wives but can turn vulgar given the context.It can be used to term men cowardly, lazy, or to refer to those who are beaten by their wives.Gideon and Ruto have openly attacked each other verbally over political rivalries.Read: I did not say Gideon Moi is uncircumcised - DP RutoGideon said he was bitter and tired of Jubilee's approach of forcing affiliate parties merge. He said the parties were used as "fillers" in the race for the presidency.The Senator said it was time for Kalenjins, especially members of the Tugen community, to chart their own paths and not be swayed by euphoria.He said the number of Kanu members in Rift Valley needed to rise from 200,000 to 500,000 "before the end of this year so we can dictate our terms properly".Gideon reiterated that the Jubilee government has failed to fulfill promises including creating jobs for youths and road construction.. Jubilee should forget getting support from the Tugen if it fails to tarmack Eldama- Ravine-Poror-Saos, Mochongoi -Marigat, Kipsaraman-Kinyach roads, he said.He urged the people of Rift Valley to stop following the huge Jubilee Party population that is "heading nowhere".They should think about their future after President Uhuru Kenyatta leaves office, he said.
