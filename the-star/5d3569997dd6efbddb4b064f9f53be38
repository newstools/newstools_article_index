Wanga elders in Mumias yesterday endorsed Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi for President.Led by former Mumias MP Francis Obongita, the elders blessed Mudavadi at the former legislator s home in Malaha, Mumias East, on Saturday.They said the ANC leader is the senior-most leader of the Luhya.Obongita was the Mumias MP up to 1982, when he lost the election to Elon Wameyo, who served for three terms up to 1997. Mudavadi is the most qualified candidate to spearhead the Luhya nation to the presidency. We want other leaders from Luhyaland with presidential aspirations to shelve their ambitions and support Mudavadi so we can move as a bloc and bring home the country s leadership, Obongita said.He told Mudavadi, Your political position has been ascending gradually and places you on the radar of national leadership. Your history in the public service gives you a clean bill of health as a capable leader. Elders Peter Munyendo, John Sembe, Charles Munyendo, Rozina Namatsi and Philip Munyendo said Mulembe people should support Mudavadi. As elders, led by our senior statesman Francis Obongita, we endorse and wish you well. Count on us to rally our people for the noble timely cause you are pursuing, Charles said.Obongita asked Mudavadi to address the problems in the ailing sugar sub-sector and stabilise the industry. Listen to the cries of the cane farmers of Mumias Sugar Company and turn around the only source of income for this region. Mumias should never be allowed to collapse because this will kill the hopes and economic future of our people, he said.Mudavadi said he was asked by the elders to visit them but he did not know their intention. But I am very much impressed by the move from the elders to endorse me and their promise to stand with me, he said.Mudavadi urged Agriculture CS Willy Bett to make public the sugar industry crisis report, which he said is meant to streamline the industry.
