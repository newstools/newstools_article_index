City Hall has bought 20 bin skippers, 17 new garbage trucks and will add 51 more to its fleet in three months to manage the garbage problem in the capital.Environment executive Peter Kimori yesterday said the county has also set aside Sh50 million to repair broken down trucks and is spending Sh60 million a month in paying garbage contractors. Our aim is to have 210 trucks in three years. We want each ward to have at least two trucks so that we depend on our own, he said.Kimori said the county has acquired a compactor, bulldozer and excavators to manage waste at the Dandora dumpsite. This will increase the waste yard s lifespan by five years, he said.The 30-year-old dumpsite is full and Kimori said the county government has hired a consultant, through the European Union and the World Bank, to carry out a feasibility study on how the waste can be recycled.
