Former PricewaterhouseCoopers senior country partner Charles Muchene has been elected the chairperson of Barclays Bank. He will replace Francis Okomo-Okello who has served his full tenure since April 2005. Barclays becomes the second publicly traded firm audited by PwC that Muchene will chair after East African Breweries. Muchene was appointed to the board of EABL in February 2011 as a non-executive director and replaced long-serving Jeremiah Kiereini a year later. With his vast experience in the financial sector, strong corporate governance credentials and business leadership skills, I believe he is exactly what the bank needs as it navigates a rapidly changing business landscape, and an increasingly dynamic and complex regulatory environment, Okomo-Okello, who will continue serving on the Barclays Africa Group's board, said in a statement on Friday. Muchene also sits on the board of insurer AIG Kenya. I am honoured and thrilled that the board has entrusted me with the role of chairman of Barclays Bank in Kenya, an institution with a rich pedigree spanning 100 years, and a culture of building and nurturing enduring relationships with its customers and communities, he said.
