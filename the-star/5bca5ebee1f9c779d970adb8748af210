State House yesterday criticised Cord leader Raila odinga for saying the opposition will resume street protests if IEBC commissioners will still be in office by October 10.Deputy President William Ruto also told the opposition to stop issuing threats of demonstrations on the IEBC officers matter. He said they should instead support efforts to have new commissioners in office within the shortest time possible. Ruto said Raila should stop complicating the matter. State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu said the government is still within the timeline set by the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission reforms. There has been concerns about the IEBC matters. All that needs to be said is that we are within the timelines and that the arrangements will be completed within the time stipulated by the relevant laws. There is no need for the strong words that have been heard in some quarters, Esipisu said at a press conference in State House, Nairobi.On Friday, while addressing a rally in Ilmashariani, Narok county, Cord leader Raila Odinga claimed the Jubilee administration is using the IEBC commissioners to do early rigging before leaving the office. The Jubilee has been trying to apply delaying tactics with the matter. This is a clear tactic to use the team to rig the elections. We will use all means to ensure they move out of the office, because Kenyans can no longer trust them to conduct the next elections, Raila said. I urge all the communities to get prepared to flush out the IEBC commissioners out of their offices. We had agreed with Jubilee they vacate their positions to pave the way for a new team, which can handle the next polls without being biased.
