Mumias Sugar managing director Errol Johnson has been urged to explain exactly what he has done to revive the still ailing company.Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe yesterday told the Star on the phone, Leaders from the sugar belt have given him the political goodwill and the government has given Sh3 billion to revive the once-vibrant sugar miller. He has no excuse not to perform. He urged Johnson to tell Western residents his plans to increase production. He is aware the scarcity of raw materials presents a challenge to the revival programme, Wangwe said.Speaking during a TV interview last week, Johnson said the company is operating at 30 per cent of its capacity for lack of cane. He said cane was being poached from contracted farmers by rival millers.Wangwe said, We don t want to politicise Mumias Sugar matters, but we need to talk business and find out how the facility can benefit farmers. He urged Johnson to fire the expatriate agricultural manager if he is unable to secure enough raw material to sustain operations.Wangwe said the management should stop firefighting and confront problems head on. There is political will and financial support is available, he said.Wangwe said many farmers uprooted the crop when Mumias was struggling. They need to be assured it is safe to return to cane farming, he said.Early this month, a sugarcane producer threatened to sue Mumias for harvesting cane from its land without consent.Channan Agricultural Contractors said cane cutters stormed their 11-acre farm at Shibale and harvested the cane without involving them.Farm manager Kennedy Njuguna accused Mumias of forcibly acquiring private sugarcane.
