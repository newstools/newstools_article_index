A Nairobi court has summoned the officer in charge of Kamiti Prison to appear before it and explain why a suspect in the Garissa University College terror attack was injected, despite not being sick.Milimani chief magistrate Daniel Ogembo issued the orders, following complaints by defence lawyer Chacha Mwita, representing Tanzanian Rashid Charles Mberesero, that the accused was subjected to an injection on July 12, without any explanation. Since my client was injected with the unknown substance, he has been having headaches, Mwita said. He complained after the prosecution, led by senior state counsel Eddie Kaddebe, tabled a medical letter from the Kamiti clinic, indicating Rashid is mentally ill and instead, should be referred to the Mathare Mental Hospital for assessment. Ogembo directed a detailed health report be tabled on October 3.
