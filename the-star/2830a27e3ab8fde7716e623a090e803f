Budalang i MP Ababu Namwamba has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to condemn leaders calling for ethnic leadership at the Moi University in Eldoret.Last Monday, some Rift Valley leaders led by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago stormed the institution of higher learning to stop the appointment of acting vice chancellor Prof Laban Ayiro, saying he does not come from the Kalenjin community. Ayiro is a Kisii.Namwamba was speaking on Saturday at Sitikho ward, Webuye West constituency, where he attended a friend s graduation party. That conduct goes against Chapter Six of the constitution which provides guidelines for integrity and ethical leadership for public officers. Anybody who spreads ethnic hate and celebrates division along tribal lines is not allowed to hold a public office, he said.Namwamba said the backward behaviour has no place in Kenya today, and not befitting of a governor and leaders of that calibre. You cannot storm a university that embraces high standards of learning, serves Kenyans from all walks of life, and bring in cheap tribal politics and when condemned you still go live on national television to talk s* again, he said.Namwamba told Mandago that Uasin Gishu is home to Kenyans from diverse backgrounds, and he cannot afford to sideline them on account of their tribes. We are now calling upon the Kalenjin elders and the Jubilee government to publicly condemn this act knowing that Prof Ayiro is a qualified citizen who can lead any university.
