Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar s political adviser Mohamed Ruwange has accused the governor s office of not consulting the people. He said the county government should not be run like a household. The people of Mombasa have the right to know how their money is being used. They should be allowed to ask questions, Ruwange said.He said it was unrealistic for the county to allocate Sh32 million for a pitch, which is not useful to all the people. The county should have priorities and deal with them accordingly. A Sh32 million pitch is not a priority to people whose children are abusing drugs, Ruwange said.
