Members of the Kamba community in Mombasa on Saturday reaffirmed their support for politician Philip Ndolo as their leader.The move came a few hours after de facto Kamba community and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka jetted into the county for a major rally.Ndolo is leading members of the Kamba community to the Jubilee Party, where they say they want their numbers to count. This should not be seen in any other way apart from an advisory council and Kamba community identifying a leader, said Sammy Kisilu, the Kamba Community Advisory Council chairperson.The Kamba community in Mombasa want Ndolo to be the running mate of a Jubilee candidate. We want to be in government, said council women adviser Ruth Mulei.Ndolo worked closely with businessman Suleiman Shahbal but their relationship has become strained.However, Shahbal, who will run for governor, has said he is open to work with anybody.
