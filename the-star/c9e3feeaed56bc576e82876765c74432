The Turkana Council of Elders in Laikipia county have asked the national government to expedite the process of issuing ID cards to the community.In a petition filed in the National Assembly, the residents, through Turkana North MP Christopher Nakuleu, want the government to stop bias in the issuance of the ID cards. The Constitution prohibits all forms of direct or indirect discrimination, the petition says.The petitioners want Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery to revoke any order directing the tedious vetting by the offices responsible for registration of persons in the county. The lengthy vetting process has deprived the members of the Turkana community of their rights to choose their leaders, the petition says.The petition is before the Administration and National Security Committee.
