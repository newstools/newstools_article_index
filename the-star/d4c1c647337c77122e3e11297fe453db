Lamu East MP Athman Shariff has accused ODM MPs for splitting the Coast Parliamentary Group.He said immediately after the Malindi by-election, the group broke up and a new outfit led by Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga took its place."There is no unity because some have personal interests," the Jubilee-allied MP said.Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Shariff said animosity between Coast parliamentarians led to CPG's collapse.Read: Joho s meteoric rise could be his downfallHe said CPG was at one point a major political unit that brought together elected leaders from the region to focus on development and politics of the region from Taita Taveta County to Lamu.Recently, Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro, who was the group chair, dismissed the new CPG, saying he had more MPs than Mwinga.[PHOTOS] Jubilee supporters endorse Mung'aro as Coast kingpin, Kilifi governorShariff said he supports the decision by a section of ODM MPs to move to Jubilee, saying those remaining in opposition are only fulfilling a selfish agenda.He said the Jubilee administration has addressed key issues in the region, which were never addressed in previous government.The MP gave the example of the tarmacking of the Garsen-Lamu road as a major step in developing Lamu and Tana counties, which had been neglected by successive governments."Lamu East constituency which comprises of over six islands has now been connected to electricity which started a few weeks ago and the President is expected to launch the project soon," he said.He said the Jubilee government was working to resolve major challenges facing Coast residents. Top among the plans was to address the land issue. The President already revoked illegal land allocations in Lamu county and he has been going round to issue title deeds. Giving Jubilee a second term will be key to enable them finish their projects, he said.He also revealed that appointment of NLC chairman Mohammed Swazuiri, who comes from Coast, was intended to help resolve land injustices.He said the appointment was an indication that Jubilee had trust in the people from the region.Shariff who was elected in a UDF ticket said he will defend his seat on a Jubilee Party ticket in the 2017 polls.
