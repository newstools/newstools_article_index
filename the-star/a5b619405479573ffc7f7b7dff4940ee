Three police officers were yesterday arraigned in court for the killing of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and a taxi driver.As the law starts to take its course against the three, there is need to revisit police reforms and ensure that the police service is actually changing, for the better.The Star has closely followed the story of the murdered trio, and broke the story of the disappearance and their possible murder.The International Justice Mission, which had employed Kimani, at the time dismissed our story. It responded to the stories on the Star website by saying our facts were wrong, fabricated and that our reporter was a liar. IJM s officials attempted to extract commitments from the newspaper that we would not publish any other story, as we had our facts wrong.Sadly for the rule of law and justice, everything we published ended up being right.Justice must be followed by measures to prevent such incidents recurring.
