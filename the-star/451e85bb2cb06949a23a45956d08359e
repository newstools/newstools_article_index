Eric Omondi has worked his way up the comedy industry to become one of the best comedians in Kenya.Over the years, his fame and popularity has expanded not only in East Africa but across the continent, and now he boasts a successful solo career.Other than having a colourful comedy career, the funny guy also has one of the most beautiful and ravishing lasses in the country.Eric s fianc e is a Kenyan-Italian model, Chantal Juliet Grazioli, who is not only a sight to behold but also very down to earth and supportive of her bae s career.The couple recently did a photoshoot, and from a picture that he shared on social media, the alluring lady seems to have a protruding belly (perhaps a growing baby bump?).Even his followers could not help but notice that little detail.We can only speculate for now about whether Miss Chanty is pregnant or not.Time will tell, after all, it s time Eric had a little tot running around the house.Meanwhile, check out the photo that got people talking.Eric Omondi and fiancee Chantal Grazioli.
