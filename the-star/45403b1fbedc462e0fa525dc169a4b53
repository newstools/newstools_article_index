The majority of Nyeri MCAs have welcomed the decision of a Nyeri court which sentenced three county government officials to three years in jail for corruption. John Maina (Lands and Infrastructure), Martin Wamwea (Finance), and chief of staff Simon Wachira were sentenced on Monday by chief magistrate John Oyiengo of the Anti-Corruption court. Majority leader Duncan Gituanja yesterday said the court did a commendable job. He said Governor Nderitu Gachagua should also be charged. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the court went for the small fish. They should now go for the big fish, Gituanja said. He said it is now clear that the procurement in Nyeri county is being done irregularly.Gituanja spoke during a press conference at the county assembly. The Nyeri county officials were ordered to pay Sh23.7 million for violating procurement laws.
