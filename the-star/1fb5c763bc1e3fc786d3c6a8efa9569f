Tension flared during Kenya Airways' annual general meeting held earlier Thursday with shareholders warning the government to stop interfering with the airline's management.The tension was triggered by a story published by the Star on Wednesday indicating several directors would be replaced with fresh blood to drive the recovery of the national carrier following a series of losses in the last two years.KQ, as it is popularly known, has undertaken several management shakeups in the past year, in response to demands that it has to conduct a total management overhaul before receiving a state bailout.Shareholders said it was wrong for the state to order KQ to fire directors since the move does not guarantee a turn around in the performance of the struggling airline."We want the government to stop threatening KQ bosses and directors," a visibly angry shareholder shouted at the AGM held at KQ's Pride Centre in Embakasi.But a Senate report, issued last December after a probe on KQ, recommended the board be overhauled and previous directors questioned over poor business strategies at the airline, that have been blamed for the losses.Chief finance officer Alex Mbugua was ousted in January for alleged under-performance while former commercial director Gerard Clarke resigned last October after KQ announced a record loss of Sh25.7 billion for the financial year 2015.Read: KQ now suspends undisclosed number of staff in fraud probeAlso read: State to overhaul KQ s board during meetingQuoting a story published by the Star on Wednesday, self proclaimed minority shareholders' activist Alloys Chami asked: "Is it right that since you have 30 per cent shares, you can come and say you will change the board?"The jibe was for the state, which has a 30 per cent stake and is the major shareholder of the airline.The airline's board has 12 members excluding the alternate director representing Treasury.The government wanted to use the AGM to demand more seats on the board. It currently has two representatives Treasury Principal Secretary Kamau Thugge and his Transport counterpart Irungu Nyakera.Only two women Wanjiku Mugane and Caroline Armstrong-Ogwapit (both non executive directors) sit on the board which is chaired by Dennis Awori who joined last October.Last year, Treasury CS Henry Rotich, while appearing before the Senate committee probing the airline, hinted at management and board changes as a pre-requisite to a government financial support plan.Kenya Airline Pilots Association has also attributed KQ's woes to mismanagement and recommended the sacking of top managers to make turnaround plans effective.On Monday, the airline's CEO Mbuvi Ngunze told Reuters news agency that KQ was in talks with three or four institutional investors and airlines to buy a stake in KQ. Sources have told the Star that one of the strongest bidders is Qatar Airways.More on this: Kenya Airways in talks for stake sale to raise cash - Ngunze
