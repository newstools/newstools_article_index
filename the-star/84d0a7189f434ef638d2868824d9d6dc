Kenyan swimmer Rebecca Kamau has withdrawn from the Africa Senior swimming Championship set for next month in South Africa.According to her Father Kiruri Kamau, Kenya Swimming Federation has taken long to release the final team that will represent Kenya in the championship, leaving them with less time to prepare since parents were taking care of all costs.A court ruling issued a fortnight ago said Kenya Swimming Federation can t select swimmers for international events as it is not compliant with the Sports Act and it cannot purport to represent swimming interests in the country.It further directed that in future, KSF sits down with the Nairobi Amateur Swimming association (NSAA) to come up with a joint selection committee in partnership with other stakeholders, who have been agitating for reforms in the selection of swimmers for various competitions.Sources privy to the meeting which sat last Friday, said Kenya may not send a team to the Africa Championships in Bloemfontein next month as the deadline to send a team elapses next week and with the joint selection committee yet to harmonise the times posted by swimmers coupled with the visa issues to the event, the team selected my be time-barred for the continental show piece.
