Gor Mahia coach Ze Maria is back in the country and will be in charge when they take on Nzoia United in a GOtv Shield contest on Sunday.Coach Ze Maria travelled to his native home on Tuesday sparking fears he may not return following the team s poor run of results in the SportPesa Premier League. However, the coach returned on Thursday and was at Camp Toyoyo to train the side ahead of their GOtv clash against the Western province based side. We know how difficult Nzoia can be but we are getting ready to handle them. Our objective is to win trophies that we are competing in and the GOtv is not an exception. Goalkeeper trainer Mathews Ottamax is hopeful that K Ogalo will bounce back to scoring ways against the National Super League side. Gor Mahia have struggled to score in their last three matches as compared to their opponents, who are currently riding high in National Super League.However, Ottamax believes K Ogalo will show their worth against the Western-based side. We are aiming to go past the round of sixteen meaning we have to win this match at all costs. It is a fact we have been shooting blanks in our past matches, but that has to change this weekend against Nzoia. We are Kenyan champions and we have to show that against them."
