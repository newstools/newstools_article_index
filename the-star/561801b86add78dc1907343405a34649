There may be further job cuts in the banking industry if lower interest rates do not translate to massive uptake of loans, a top official has said, as interest controls took effect on Wednesday. Smaller banks are further likely to be starved of cash due to increased competition for deposits from larger ones at almost similar rates, analysts have argued. NIC Group managing director John Gachora said lenders, which are largely dependent on interest income for profit, will be looking to trim operating costs to cover for reduced earnings. The banking industry fired 2,036 staff, largely in clerical and secretarial units, in 2015 as banks put in place automated systems to enhance operations, the Central Bank said in Banking Supervision Annual Report. The capping of interest at 14.5 per cent and putting a floor of 7.35 per cent interest on deposits has raised fears of further job losses in the near term due to expected decline in earnings. There is no question that efficiency has to come into play...when you have such reduced margins. Hopefully this (interest controls) will bring more customers to the banks more customers who will be willing not just to borrow but also to save, Gachora said in an interview on Citizen TV Wednesday night.
