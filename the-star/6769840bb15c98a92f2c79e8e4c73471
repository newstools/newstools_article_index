Angry farmers from Ihindu village, Naivasha, have blocked the installation of power lines.They said they will not allow the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company to carry out the project until they are compensated. The 550KV line will see the country import 400mw from Ethiopia. The project is expected to be complete by 2018.However, farmers from the village blocked the power company staff from erecting masts until their compensation grievances are resolved.Farmer Joel Konyo said the company had not fully engaged them in the project.He said the compensation cash that Ketraco is offering is little compared to the value of land. The project will leave many people as squatters. We are asking Ketraco to engage all the affected farmers before proceeding with this project, Konyo said. Area MCA Samuel Waithuki said there is need for consultations from all the parties. He said that scores of families had been affected by the power line.
