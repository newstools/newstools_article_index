They claim that there are hurdles in Nairobi, but the same is inexistent," Gichengo told the Star on the phone.She said the officials in question have been trying to block the stateless people from reaching Uhuru because they have failed and have no explanation to the President over the same."When stateless people notified the government that the walk is on this week, chairman Thomas Nguli received calls from people who expressed fear of losing their jobs," she added.For his part, Nguli said they will not be cowed by any attempts by state officials to intimidate them.Read: Stateless people give up kids so they can get IDs, schooling
