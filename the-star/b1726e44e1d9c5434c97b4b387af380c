The humble petitioners pray that the National Assembly does not approve his nomination to become Chief Justice and compels Justice Maraga to make an apology to the family of the deceased, the people of Ainamoi constituency and the people of Kenya at large, for his indiscretion and failure to uphold the constitution, the petition reads in part.The state's appeal case against Maraga's ruling is pending at the Court of Appeal.Onyancha wants the nomination rejected on the basis that Maraga was responsible for the gross backlog of cases in Eldoret.For the vetting at Continental House in Nairobi, Maraga was asked to bring along his original identity card, academic and professional certificates, and testimonials.He is also to take letters or certificates of clearance from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Kenya Revenue Authority, Higher Education Loans Board, Directorate of Criminal Investigations and any credit reference bureau.
