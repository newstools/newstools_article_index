Chama Cha Uzalendo chairman Maur Bwanamaka has denied media reports that the party dissolved to join Jubilee.Bwanamaka, however, said the party will support President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election bid in 2017.Read: CCU denies dissolutionHe noted that the party is still independent and had not joined Uhuru's Jubilee Party during the recent merger at Kasarani stadium. The fact that we are affiliated to Jubilee does not mean that we have folded as some people would want Kenyans to believe. We are an independent party but supporting Uhuru's bid because we are not fielding a presidential candidate, Bwanamaka said.The party signed a post-coalition agreement with Jubilee in 2013. Bwanamaka noted that they will soon call for a National Delegates Convention to officially declare their support for Uhuru.On September 10, at least 11 political parties under Jubilee Alliance merged to form Jubilee Party in a ceremony that was attended by Uhuru and his deputy William Ruto.Read: 11 parties fold and merge into Jubilee todayBwanamaka however revealed that the party's failure to join Jubilee emanated from the fear that nominations would not be free and fair. We can not be agreeing to anything that Jubilee says or does. Other than the position of president, we will be sponsoring our own candidates for other elective seats in 2017, he said. The CCU party leader also noted that the recently enacted legislation against party hopping is not meant to promote sanity in the electoral system but to protect the interests of a clique of individuals who wield power. Rather than waste time and spend fortunes trying to secure nominations in Jubilee where decisions have already been made, we urge aspirants to come to us, he said.Also read: Tribunal rules Ndeti is the CCU leader
