Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti has said he will go around with a list of the projects he has initiated during campaigns to silence his critics. He said his opponents do not appreciate the work done by his administration. He urged his opponents for governor to follow suit. Some of my opponents have been in political leadership and others in the national government, hence we expect them to tell us what they have done, not empty rhetoric, Awiti said. He addressed journalists on Tuesday after meeting anti-corruption commission officials at the county headquarters in Homa Bay town. We spend Sh220 million monthly on employees salaries. The county absorbed a good number of employees from the national government and the defunct local authorities, Awiti said. The remaining meagre amount is spent prudently on development, hence one cannot purport we misuse public resources. List of achievementsThe governor said Homa Bay was rundown when he was elected but he has changed its face by initiating a number of projects. Awiti said his administration has installed solar street lights in all trading centres, opened roads in the wards and improved healthcare services. He said Homa Bay is one of the counties with improved Early Childhood Development Education facilities and has employed 1,240 ECDE teachers.Awiti said he was exonerated by the EACC over the loss of money in an agri-city project. I have letters to prove the case, he said. Awiti said he will beat his opponents hands down next year.Awiti was accompanied by Agriculture executive Eliud Otieno and Roads chief officer Chris Agong . More than 1,200 cows have been artificially inseminated and we expect more than 4,000 animals to give birth to high value calves, he said.
