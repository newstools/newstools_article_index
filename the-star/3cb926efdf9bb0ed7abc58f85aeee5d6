Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang ula has said he was not isolated at a meeting to discuss Luhya unity hosted last weekend by Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli.The Cord co-principal says he was invited to attend the meeting, but could not make it. How do I get isolated by not going to a harambee? I was invited and I declined to go, Wetang ula said.The harambee had been organised to raise money for a school in Khwisero, with the leaders present later invited to discuss unity talks at Atwoli s rural home. [Former Lugari MP Cyrus] Jirongo was not there; [Senator Boni] Khalwale was not there; I was not there; and we believe that Francis Atwoli is trying to take our community to an auction ring and we will not allow him, Wetang ula said.He said he had arranged to attend other meetings in Western, and did not snub Atwoli. In fact on that Saturday I had structured meetings in Teso, in Bungoma and in Trans Nzoia, which I couldn t cancel, Wetang ula said.The Luhya unity talks are meant to rally the community to vote as a bloc and to support one leader from the region to run for President.Three politicians from the region have declared their interest in the presidency. They are Wetang ula, Jirongo and Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi.
