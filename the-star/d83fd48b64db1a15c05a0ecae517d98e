Striking Nairobi doctors have been urged to go back to work as their grievances will be addressed before the end of the week.Governor Evans Kidero yesterday said the doctors will receive their six month's salary arrears, allowances and promotion letters by tomorrow. If by the end of Friday you will not have received your allowances, salaries and promotion letters, then on Monday next week don t go to work, he said.The doctors, led by Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union secretary general Ouma Oluga, marched to City Hall from Kenyatta Hospital to seek audience with the governor.Oluga accused the county government, particularly county secretary Robert Ayisi, of playing cat-and-mouse games with them over salaries. We agreed with what the court said and stopped the strike. But what we are demanding now is that we be treated with dignity, our salaries paid and be given our promotion letters, he said.The about 250 doctors went on strike on September 9, but the strike was suspended on September 16 by the Employment and Labour Relations Court until September 29.Oluga said it is disappointing that doctors had to go to the streets for their salaries to be paid. A country is not a country if a doctor who has studied for seven years and went back for an additional four years for specialised training comes and an MCA tells him there is no money to pay him, he said.Other grievances raised by the doctors include alleged failure by the county government to remit their NHIF and NSSF contribution for eight months.They also complained that the county did not give them car and mortgage allowances.The doctors had dared Kidero to sack them for refusing to go back to work without pay.They, however, confirmed they had received appointment letters.
