Not even his mother-in-law s funeral could keep Nyando MP Fred Outa from an ODM rally in Kisumu on Saturday. The MP,a crusader for party loyalty, abruptly left the ceremony in Aila village, Siaya, with his colleagues who had landed in a chopper on their way to the rally. Outa had early hinted to the press that he would make a big announcement when his political friends arrived, but he left without even notifying family members.His statement forced the presiding priest to give the family an ultimatum either he presides over the service or hands over to the politicians, take his leave and let the reverend wind up.The family chose to go on with the service. But when politicians arrived, they only stayed for less than 10 minutes.
