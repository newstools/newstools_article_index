Attempts to impeach Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero were thwarted yesterday after Cord MCAs ganged up and beat a member who was to table the motion.Viwandani MCA Sam Nyang wara (ODM) was attacked and roughed up by Dan Oria (Dandora Phase IV) immediately he took to the floor. Other Cord members joined and beat him up. Nyang wara sought protection from the serjeant-at-arms.Shortly after, Cord MCAs engaged in a war of words with their Jubilee counterparts and started chanting, yote yawezekana bila Nyang wara (All is possible without Nyang wara) and Msaliti (Traitor).The Cord MCAs said they will meet tomorrow to discuss the conduct of rebel members who want to rock the party from within.Nyang wara said he lost his two phones and Sh5,000 in the fracas. He told the press the motion will go on as planned. Nyang wara had earlier said more than 56 MCAs signed the petition to remove the city boss from the office.He said Kidero has violated the Constitution since we joined the assembly and failed to implement the Ward Development Fund. We have been passing budgets, but have not seen anything happening in our wards, he said.Nyang wara also accused the governor of financial misappropriation. He said enough is enough , they cannot wait for another report on misappropriation.This is not the first attempt to impeach Kidero. In September 2013, Karura ward representative Kamau Thuo introduced a motion to impeach him for allegedly slapping Nairobi woman representative Rachael Shebesh.Thuo last year accused Kidero of giving a Sh200 million bribe to a Supreme Court judge to rule in his favour in a case in which Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu challenged his election. Kidero denies the allegation.It requires two thirds of the 127 MCAs to remove the governor. Cord has 64 members. Jubilee has 63.
