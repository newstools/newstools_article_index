A critical four-day make or break period for champions Gor Mahia begin today when they host Western stima in a midweek SportPesa Premier League clash at Nyayo Stadium.K Ogalo will then duel with serial nemesis AFC Leopards this Sunday. Last Sunday, Gor relinquished the second of the three trophies they won last year when they were beaten by unfancied Muhoroni Youth in the final of the KPL Top 8, forcing their fans to invade the stadium in frustration. It s easy for the K Ogallo players to feel sorry for themselves, having dominated the final against plucky Muhoroni. However whether they have put behind them that disappointment and the heart in mouth moment when fans charges after them, remains to be seen todayAlready the champions albeit having played a game less are seven points adrift of title favourites Tusker and have little window to negotiate if they are to claim an unprecedented fourth successive top flight title.What has been K Ogalo s undoing this season is the lack of goals by their strikers. It has undermined their bid to become the first team to win back-to-back Top 8 crowns and it has seen them drop crucial points in otherwise winnable games. Much of the blames will be put to Rwandese record signing Jacques Tuyisenge, who has failed to add onto his eight league goals since compatriot Medie Kagere was brought to ease the goal scoring burden on him.That responsibility is one which Kagere has failed to leave up to as he is yet to score in the league despite being a regular starter. Coach Ze Maria, whose future also hangs in the balance this week having failed to convince the powers that be at Kenya s most successful club that he can take them to the next level, must take his share of blame for the position Gor find themselves in.His tinkering habits have not endeared him to the club s rank and file hence the inconsistent performances. There is no better team to take advantage of that than Stima who also harbour ambitions of finishing higher than their current fourth place. Under the tutelage of two-time KPL/SJAK/Fidelity Insurance coach of the month, Henry Omino, Stima have been a force to reckon with in the second half and had they had a similar start to the campaign as their current form, they would have been unlikely challengers for the top flight title.
