Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwamba has said the party will soon announce if it will field a presidential candidate.He said if the party does not field a candidate, it will back one of those in the race. The party has, however, made it clear that it is not allied to either Jubilee or Cord. Kenya is a democracy and we must reject any attempts to force Kenyans into an arrangement of if you are not in Cord, then you must be in Jubilee. There are other options. The Labour Party is a top notch option, Namwamba said in Busia.He also offered to mediate between ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya s Moses Wetang ula and Cyrus Jirongo to agree on a single presidential candidate. Competing interests in the presidency is one of the factors that cause political divisions in Western. We are best placed to play the Kofi Annan role between my big brothers Musalia, Wetang ula and Jirongo, because the Labour Party does not have a presidential candidate yet, he said.Namwamba said if the three do not agree on a formula to make the region a formidable player in 2017, he will be in the race for President in 2022.He spoke when he launched phase one of LPK s countrywide popularisation campaigns. The Budalang i MP started the tour in his native Busia county on Friday, then to Bungoma on Saturday and in Kisii yesterday.Namwamba attracted huge enthusiastic crowds comparable. Since the relaunch in Nairobi last month, LPK has captured political territory from Jubilee and Cord.Namwamba asked Jubilee and Cord to end the politics of blame games, which he said have polarised Kenya What Kenya needs is a new shepherd who will neither devour nor salivate at the meat of the flock, but will instead care for the flock for the benefit of all, he said. The hungry ones will eat at double pace to make up for all the hunger pangs.
