Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has dissolved the NGO Coordination Board, a day after the governing council linked him to a Sh20 million bribe.Kiunjuri also suspended executive director Fazul Mohamed pending investigations on allegations that he is not qualified for the post.Read: NGO board chairman Fazul degree a fake, explains Egerton donEgerton University in November last year disowned Fazul degree.The Registrar of Academic Affairs, Prof SFO Owido, said Mahamed Yusuf, as he was known in college, was discontinued on academic grounds in his third year by the senate on August 26, 2010.However, his CV shows he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry in 2009.In a letter to the National Council of NGOs dated September 10, Owido says Fazul was admitted as a regular student in 2007 to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture.He changed the course through an inter-faculty transfer on September 27, 2007.Fazul was discontinued for failing 50 per cent or more of all the credit factors taken in the ordinary exams of one academic year.Kiujuru further dismissed the bribery dossier linking him with a Sh20 million bribe saying the petitioner was non-existent.A petition was presented to the EACC claiming Kiunjuri had accepted the bribe from NGOs to pass PBO Act 2016.The affidavit on the alleged bribery allegations and abuse of office was lodged by a Ms Delphine Bram Christopher.But Kiunjuri said on Thursday: "The Immigration department has confirmed to me there is no expatriate by the name Bram Christopher."This is a clear indicator that whoever presented the petition to EACC was an imaginary petitioner."The CS said he decided to suspend Fazul to give him a chance to clear his name."Fazul has court cases on his academic qualifications. We are investigating... If he is innocent he will be back," he said.A raft of allegations were raised against Fazul in July. In documents seen by the Star, the executive was accused of opening branches countrywide and posting interns on full pay.More on this: NGOs board boss Fazul transfers HR staff amid claims of nepotism, funds misuseThree NGO bosses on Tuesday disowned the affidavit sent to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.They are Irungu Houghton, Associate Director of the Society for International Development; George Kegoro, Executive Director of the Kenya Human Rights Commission and Paul Healey, Country Director of Trocaire International.Through their lawyers, the three denied meeting at a hotel in Nairobi to raise "facilitation" money for Kiunjuri to gazette a bill without amendment.They dismissed as fabrication the reports that they met Kiunjuri and agreed to pay him a Sh20,000,000 bribe to facilitate the passage of the Public Benefits Organizations Act 2013 without amendments.The affidavit sent to the EACC with Christopher as the sole signatory further claimed that Kiunjuri s Senior Advisor Wambui Kimathi received an initial amount of Sh10,000,000 on his behalf on September 5, 2016. We take great exception to these unfounded, baseless and slanderous allegations. They are meant to discredit on-going efforts to transform the NGO sector and the leadership at the NGO Bureau, said the three directors.Kiunjuri also told the Star on Monday that the affidavit was "rubbish and propaganda".It is believed the misinformation could be part of a power struggle designed to discredit Kiunjuri.Read:Three NGO directors disown affidavit alleging Sh20 million bribe to Kiunjuri
