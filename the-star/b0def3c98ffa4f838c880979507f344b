A man has been shot dead in Charlotte on a second night of violence as protests over the fatal police shooting of a black man spun out of control.The person who died on Wednesday night was shot in a "civilian on civilian" incident, the city said.Riot police have lined the streets to face off against hundreds of protesters and tear gas has been fired.Protesters are angry that a 43-year-old man, Keith Lamont Scott, was killed by police on Tuesday.Police said Mr Scott had been repeatedly told to drop his handgun before he was shot.But his family dispute that narrative and say he was reading a book.His death sparked violent protests on Tuesday night, leaving 16 officers injured.Police say Mr Scott first got out of the car with a gun, then got back in when officers directed him to drop his weapon.As he got out again, they say, officers shot him.The use of lethal police force against African Americans has been the subject of nationwide protests across the US for two years.Another African American was killed by police in Tulsa on Friday, and officers said on Sunday he had been unarmed.
