It s unbelievable that in their two-decade existence, Ulinzi Stars have never won Kenya s foremost cup competition now known as the GOtv Shield.The soldiers will have no better chance to end that long-standing drought than this year after they were pitted against National Super League side Kariobangi Sharks in the semi-finals of the tournament, whose winners earn the ticket to represent Kenya in the soon to be expanded CAF Confederations Cup.Both Ulinzi and Sharks came through the lottery of penalties as winners on a weekend when all the knockout matches were determined on shoot outs after stalemates in regulation time.Sharks will feel they can go all the way after they ended the reign of Bandari 5-4 on post-match penalties after their tie had ended 1-1 in normal time. Substitute Danny Serenkuma missed his spot kick while Sharks converted all their five penalties through Pascal Ogweno, Ibrahim Kitawi, Elly Asieche, Boniface Akenga and StephenOdhiambo.Edwin Lavatsa, Anthony Kimani, David Kingatua and Musa Mudde had all defeated Sharks penalty specialist John Oyemba from the spot. A place in the semi-finals was no less than Sharks deserved after dominating the tie in regulation time. Rogers Omondi put the victors in front just after the break, rifling a left-footed effort past JosephOkoth after Asieche had teed him up.Mudde equalised for Bandari, who would eventually relinquish the trophy at the same Nyayo Stadium, venue where they had triumphed 10 months earlier. Ulinzi too drew 1-1 with second tier high-flyers Nzoia United before prevailing in the shoot out with Geoffrey Kokoyo, netting the winning spot-kick in the 4-2 win after goalkeeper Bernard Mang ala had missed the crucial one for Nzoia,.The other semi-final spot will be fought out between KCB and the winners of the delayed quarter-final clash between Posta Rangers and Agro Chemicals who will duel tomorrow. KCB upstaged Western Stima 4-3 in the shoot-outs that followed a goal-less draw in regulation time. The bankers custodian Juma Mpongo was the hero as he scored once and saved from his opposite number Gabriel Andika, Shimonyo and Estone Esiye.KCB had converted their penalties through Dennis Ng ang a, Frank Balabala and Erick Okoth and Mpongo. Posta on the other hand, took full advantage of being reinstated in the tourney by defeating Ushuru 5-4 with strikes from Timothy Otieno, Titus Achesa, Charles Odette, Duncan Otieno and Patrick Matasi with Ushuru s Nelson Marasowe, Maurice Odipo, Evans Kiwanuka and Roy Okal also hitting the back of the net but were eliminated due to misses from Ebrima Sanneh, Rodgers Ochieng and Kennedy Odour.
