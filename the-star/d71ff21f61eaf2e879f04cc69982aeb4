Murang'a residents are not opposed to the Northern Collector Tunnel project, Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau has said.He said at a meeting in Kigumo on Friday that the locals will be happy to see the project implemented under the right channels.Jamleck asked the government, Athi water services board and other stakeholders involved in the construction to find a solution to issues raised about the project.He wants the issues addressed to avoid a stalemate that is likely to rock the multi-billion project."We are not opposed to the project. This is a venture by President Uhuru Kenyatta. All we want is that issues that our people raised are addressed," he said.Jamleck said that leaders and residents have raised three issues which they feel need to be reaffirmed to them."One is provision of water to all Murang'a residents, second is assurance that the tunnel will not cause any short and long-term environment degradation," he said."We also want to be assured that everyone will be compensated as agreed," Jamleck said.A panel of experts was appointed on Friday to answer questions raised over the project that is set to bolster supplies of water to Nairobi.Read: [AUDIO] Panel of experts appointed to answer questions raised over troubled Water projectThe issues emerged on Monday when Cord leader Raila Odinga demanded that the Sh6.8 billion project be stopped.Raila, who termed the project as "secret, ridiculous" Jubilee initiative, said that the same poses danger since the area is prone to mudslides and seismic activity.
