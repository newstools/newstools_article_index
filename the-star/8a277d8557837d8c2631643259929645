Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto has announced that he will run for senator in the 2022 general election.Rutto said he will seek re-election in 2017 on his Chama Cha Mashinani's ticket and go for the senate seat thereafter.He said this will enable him to continue championing the success of devolution in the country."I still have five years to complete my two terms. If you want my support you should endorse my bid to defend the seat, after all you are still young politically," he said."But I see you have matured and in 2022 you will be fully ripe to go."He spoke during the launch of a classroom block constructed by Unilver Tea Company at Koiwa Central SecondarySchool in Konoin.He was with National Water Conservation and Pipeline Corporation chairman Julius Kones, who is eying the governor's seat on a Jubilee Party ticket.Rutto said he wants to ensure his pledges to the people are met before handing over to another leader.He told Kones to rally behind him in 2017 so that he does the same in 2022.

Just as we agreed in the 2013 polls, that whoever sneaks through will go for one term and afterward support the other in 2017, it is now time for you bwana Governor to support me.
