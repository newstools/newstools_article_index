For a while there, it actually seemed as though the threat of the terrorist group, al Shabaab, could be tossed into the dustbin of history. It had after all been many months since Kenyans learned with horror of yet another terrorist attack against one target or another. But with the attack in Mandera on Thursday, specifically targeting a building whose tenants were mostly non-locals, and in which six people were killed, we now know that we are not so lucky. The terrorist attacks are yet with us.Although the Northeastern regional coordinator, Mohamud Saleh, has assured the residents of that region that this was just an isolated incident and that they should not worry about the security situation, there can be no consolation at this time.The trend in the past has been that the al Shabaab militia initially start with relatively isolated targets, and then move on to ever bolder attacks - always choosing civilian targets, and seeking to cause the maximum number of casualties.Until the terrorist group is rooted out, in Somalia as in Kenya, eternal vigilance is the price we must pay for our liberty.
