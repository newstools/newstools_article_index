More than 230 workers employed by the Embu government on casual terms for six years have threatened to go on strike.They work as secretaries, clerks, revenue collection officers, firefighters, garbage collectors and cleaners and enforcement officers. They want to be absorbed. One worker yesterday said, Some of us have been at work since 2010, but the government has been employing other people from the county with the same academic and professional qualifications, and even less experience. The officers said the county has employed 1,000 people on a permanent basis since 2013, ignoring them. Public Service executive Pamela Kiarie last week said the government will absorb workers gradually. She was summoned by the assembly to explain measures put in place to improve standards.
