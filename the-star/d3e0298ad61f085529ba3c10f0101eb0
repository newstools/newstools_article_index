British consumers were their most confident in five years in September, a survey showed yesterday, but the upbeat mood was not shared in London where most voters opposed leaving the European Union in June's Brexit referendum.The buoyant overall tone of the survey commissioned by business advisory firm Deloitte echoed other measures of confidence by consumers who appear to have shrugged off the shock vote to leave the EU.Deloitte said confidence among consumers rose by three percentage points from its previous quarterly survey.
