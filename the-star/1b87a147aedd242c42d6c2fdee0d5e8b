Jamal Gaddafi is a celebrated news presenter who rose to fame after winning KTN's reality show 'The Presenter' and now hosts a music show dubbed 'Mzuqa'. He has constantly made a name for himself in the showbiz industry and has never disappointed.He has mastered the art of entertainment and knows exactly what today's generation would like to watch.This ninja is a hunk and I tend to believe the ladies will agree with me. His sense of style has always been on top and guys try as hard as they can to try his style. Some pull it off but some fail miserably. Fashion is not for everyone. Try to keep up fellas.Apart from living the ultimate showbiz kinda life, Jamal is a family man. He is a husband to an extremely beautiful lady who is not much into the public shenanigans. Such kinda ladies are hard to spot this days. He tends to keep his life more private and not much is known about his life behind closed doors.The two were blessed with a bouncy baby boy last month (August). Jamal was out of the country when his son was born but he couldn't hide the joy of being a father.Jamal is a celebrity and many people know him. He recently celebrated his son's Aqiqa (celebration of the birth of one's child). the ceremony was attended by top notch government officials such Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Hon Junet Mohamed, Hon Farah Maalim and senatorial aspirant Steve Mbogo.Check out the photos below.
