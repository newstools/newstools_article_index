A night guard was killed while his colleague was seriously injured during an hour-long robbery at a club in Webuye town on Tuesday.The attackers stole with close to Sh50,000 from Mana Club, said to belong to Bungoma county roads chief officer Herbert Kibunguchi.Elizabeth Wamalwa, a receptionist, said the three attackers were not masked but armed with crude weapons including iron bars and wooden rods."They were just young boys ... they stormed here and claimed they had killed our guards and asked us to comply with everything they said," she told journalists on Wednesday."They ordered my colleague and I to give them all the cash we had."Wamalwa said the gang forced them to go to the clents' rooms where their mobile phones and cash were stolen.Area residents led by Robinson Kisunia asked police to beef up security in the town."We know most of these cops have stayed here for too long. We want them to be taken elsewhere," said Kisunia.He noted that more than five security guards have been killed in a span of one month, in robbery incidents in Webuye town.A source at Webuye police station told the Star that most of the officers are demoralised for lack of vehicles for carrying out patrols.The source said this was despite requests for the vehicles.Bungoma East OCPD Isaac Odumbe said police were pursuing the suspects."It is just a matter of time before we arrest them," he said.The incident comes barely a week after three other guards were killed in Sango area during a robbery at a petrol station.The OCPD said police have arrested two people in connection with the incident.More on this: Three security guards killed during robbery at petrol stationAlso read: Webuye politicians demand tight security at burial of murdered watchman
