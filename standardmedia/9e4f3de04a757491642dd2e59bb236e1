Central Organisation of Trade Union Secretary General Francis Atwoli has said Western region will unveil its preferred presidential candidate for 2017 in December. Speaking in Eshibinga village, Kakamega County on Saturday during the burial of Julius Shikhule, he said the community will chart its political agenda through this candidate. &ldquo;In December, we must have the region&rsquo;s presidential candidate who will automatically be the community&rsquo;s spokesman,&rsquo;&rsquo; he stated. Atwoli said that even though the region is the second most populous, voting patterns have been non-impressive because people lack voters&rsquo; cards. He asked the locals to register as voters and exercise their democratic right in order to support the region&#39;s presidential candidate in the forthcoming general election. &quot;The declaration we are going to make is for the community vote. It is not against any leader in this country but for the benefit of unity. It will also be a message that western will never be a walk in walk outs,&#39;&#39;Atwoli opined.
