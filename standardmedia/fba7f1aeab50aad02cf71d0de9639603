Jacob Otieno popularly known as Jaro Soja is a wanted man. The police want Gor Mahia Football Club&rsquo;s most ardent fan to record a statement for allegedly assaulting another fan. For a man whose love for football has earned him accolades, an appointment with the Head of State and ultimately a job with the Stadia Management Board, nothing short of being an ambassador of peace is expected of Mr Otieno. He could be innocent of the charges. Sadly though, football hooliganism in Kenya remains a major problem and in a way, Gor Mahia fans top the charts. Not for the first time, Gor Mahia fans have behaved in a very unsports-like manner, invading the pitch, stoning their opponents and harassing innocent motorists. On Sunday, Muhoroni Youth Football Club beat Gor Mahia to clinch the title for the Kenyan Premier League Top 8 final, but Gor Mahia fans would have none of this. Characteristic of them, they turned unruly, prompting the police to use teargas to control the ensuing chaos. Such behaviour is unacceptable. Every competition has a winner and a loser. Losers ought to be magnanimous in defeat while winners remain gracious in their win. For Kenyans bewildered by politics and politicians, sports offers a catharsis of sorts. And therefore hooligans out to spoil the party for them, should be dealt with ruthlessly.
