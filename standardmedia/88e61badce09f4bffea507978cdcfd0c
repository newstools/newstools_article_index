President Jacob Zuma of South Africa arrived in Nairobi yesterday on a State visit. Coming after the April Trade and Investment Summit held in South Africa, this visit is important. Among issues to be discussed are the modalities of improving trade and bilateral relations between the two countries. The significance of the visit is highlighted by recent events following South Africa&rsquo;s introduction of tough visa rules for Kenyans that nearly strained relations between the two countries. That impasse was however solved. While Nigeria is ranked Africa&rsquo;s largest economy followed by Egypt with South Africa in tow, the latter is Africa&rsquo;s most advanced economy. More importantly, South Africa is ranked Kenya&rsquo;s fifth and fourth largest source of imports and foreign direct investment respectively, after China, India and South Korea. Some protocols need to be put in place to reduce the cost of doing business as an attraction for more South African companies to invest in Kenya. That would also take care of complaints similar to those that claim cheap milk from South Africa has negatively affected dairy farmers locally. Trade arrangements should not appear to favour one country over the others, as things stand today. Kenya therefore needs to step its exports to South Africa especially of tea, vegetables, hides and skins, among other things.
