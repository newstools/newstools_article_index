Calls by four Ukambani MPs who defected to Jubilee Party to have Wiper party dissolved have been downplayed. The MPs demanded that party leader Kalonzo Musyoka dissolves the outfit and convenes a leaders&#39; meeting to chart the way forward for region&#39;s political destiny. Over the weekend, MPs Francis Mwangangi (Yatta), Joe Mutambu (Mwingi Central), Richard Makenga (Kaiti) and Kisoi Munyao (Mbooni) at a church function also threatened to announce &#39;a major declaration&#39; should Mr Kalonzo fail to heed to a 30-day ultimatum they issued for him to meet their demands. The MPs further argued that there was no reason for Kalonzo to continue being in the Opposition while it was clear that he or his community stood to gain nothing, politically. But in response, Senators Johnstone Muthama (Machakos), Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni) and Kathiani MP Robert Mbui downplayed the MPs&#39; demands saying they have no moral authority to discuss Wiper Party issues. &quot;Those MPs do not belong to Wiper because they defected to JP, and have no mandate to issue statements regarding the party. I dare them to convene the meeting they are talking about and they will realiwe they are not men enough,&quot; said Senator Muthama.
