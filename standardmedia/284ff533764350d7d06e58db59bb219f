The Senate&#39;s decision to revoke Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua&#39;s impeachment has drawn mixed reactions from local leaders in the county. Nyeri MP Priscillah Nyokabi said the Senate ignored proven charges against the governor. &quot;The governor and the county government have heard loud and clear the issues that brought them to the impeachment motion,&quot; she said. Mukurweini MP Kabando wa Kabando voiced support for the MCAs&#39; decision to impeach Mr Gachagua, saying they submitted legitimate and grave concerns. &quot;Senators raised serious questions on the financial improprieties but their decision was inconsistent with the evidence because they sympathised with the accused,&quot; he noted. Mathira MP Peter Weru said the Senate&#39;s decision was disappointing and set a bad precedence.
