Four people have been shot dead at a mall in northwest Washington state and the gunman has fled the scene, police said on social media on Friday. The shooting occurred at about 7:30 p.m. local time Friday at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington, about 65 miles (105 km) north of Seattle, Washington State Patrol spokesman Mark Francis said in a Twitter post. A local hospital told a CBS affiliate that it has received one casualty from the shooting. The station reported that a nearby high school football game was evacuated as a precaution. Francis said police were actively searching for the shooter, who was described as a &quot;Hispanic male wearing gray&quot; and last seen walking toward a nearby highway away from the mall. Rescue workers were entering the mall to attend to the injured, Francis said in a Twitter post. The shooting comes less than a week after a man stabbed nine people at a mall in central Minnesota before being shot dead. The FBI is investigating that attack as a potential act of terrorism.
