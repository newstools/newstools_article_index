Forget the huge fuel guzzlers cars that have long been associated with the big politicians in the country, with they dynamism of time, need for speed and razzmatazz that comes with politics, the next elections will be a battle right from the air. Be it speed or&nbsp;the ultimate political statement, the political &#39;big boys&#39; are increasingly using helicopters as their preferred means of transport. And to ensure their preparedness for the 2017 political duel, most of the top&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;have&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;top of the range helicopters that include the eurocopters as 350 to the powerful Bell 407 that ensure reliability of both speed and stamina in what could arguably be the most grueling polls ever in Kenya. In the last two years alone President Kenyatta, his deputy William Ruto, opposition&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;and CORD co principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Amani National Congress (ANC) leader&nbsp;Musalia Mudavadi and Peter Kenneths have&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;the helicopters popularly known as &#39;choppers&#39; and have already put to test. This is on top of the list that includes Kanu supremo Gideon Moi, retired President Mwai Kibaki, Embu senator Lenny Kivuti, former ministers Simeon Nyachae and&nbsp;Nicholas Biwott. Whereas President Kenyatta had earlier&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;one in the run up to the 2012 elections, according to a source at Wilson, another&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;was added to his list last year.

Last year both Raila and Kalonzo bought a bell 407 and AS&nbsp;350B3 eurocopter respectively. However, Wiper&nbsp;leader&#39;s&nbsp;chopper&nbsp;5Y- DKK which had been chartered by Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) ruling party in Tanzania during the election campaigns tragically crashed in October 2015 killing the pilot and three passengers including outspoken parliamentary aspirant Deo Filikunjombe. The former vice President has been compensated by the insurer for the crashing of the chopper at Selous Game Reserve enroute the town of Ludewa in southwest Tanzania.&nbsp;It is however not clear if he is in the process of&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;another ahead of the elections. According to Rotorspot, a website that monitors the civil helicopters registered worldwide and their histories including &nbsp;those which are still active and those that have crashed, there are more than 153, 480 helicopters in their latest update as at 31-Aug-2016. Rotorspot indicates that there are 131&nbsp;choppers&nbsp;both active and those written off in Kenya and about 61 of those planes are privately owned including those&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;by the &#39;big boys&#39; of politics. The latest in the fleet of&nbsp;choppers&nbsp;is the entrance of two AS 350 eurocopters under a company associated with the Deputy President that arrived last month and&nbsp; 5Y-PPS owned by Kibwezi West MP Patrick Musimba whose assembly was completed early this month.
