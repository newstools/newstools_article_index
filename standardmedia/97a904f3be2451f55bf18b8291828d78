The burden of providing for his family and siblings is what motivated Benson Nyamboga to look for a job in the military. Mr Nyamboga, from Nyamaiya village, said life had been tough for them since their parents died in 1996 and 1998. The second of five children had to take over the responsibility of feeding and educating his siblings after their older sister got married. The burden, he said, became even heavier when he too got married as he was faced with the Herculean task of providing for his family as well as his siblings. &ldquo;It has been tough because I did not have a regular job. I have been doing odd jobs to make ends meet. It has been a major challenge but there is hope for us now,&rdquo; said Nyamboga. He said he prayed that God would give him a chance to join the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) during the recent recruitment so he could provide for his family.
