Turkana Senator John Munyes has vowed to unseat Governor Josephat Nanok in next year&#39;s elections. Munyes, who has since defected to the new Jubilee Party, accuses the governor of failing to deliver on his election promises. He said Nanok has also failed to account for billions of shillings meant for development. &quot;I am the one to send Nanok home for failing in his mandate even as we look forward to forming the next government,&quot; he said. Munyes, who was Ford Kenya chairman, is among the three CORD legislators from the region who joined Jubilee last Thursday. Others were Turkana East MP Nicholas Ng&#39;ikor (Ford-K) and his Loima counterpart Protus Akuja (ODM). The decision leaves the Opposition without an MP in the region. However, Nanok exuded confidence that he will retain his seat, based on his development record.
