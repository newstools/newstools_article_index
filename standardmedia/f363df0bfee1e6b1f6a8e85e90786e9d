&nbsp; A trader was killed by unknown assailants on Tuesday night in Migori County. Police and family said Joseph Chacha, commonly known as &#39;Jamasai&#39;, who was a member the Migori County Contractors Association, was gunned down at about 8pm in his compound in Kehanche town. Nothing was stolen from him. According to his wife Robi Mobare, who is the Vice Chairperson of the Migori County public service board, Mr Chacha was at home when two workers who had gone to pick a generator knocked on the gate. &quot;He opened and the assailants entered with the workers. They shot my husband in the head and the two workers were also shot,&quot; she said. Chacha was rushed to Ombo Hospital where he was pronounced dead. His elder brother, Roman Makabwa, described his brother as sociable and jovial.

Masaba MCA Abeid Maroa, who spoke on behalf of Kuria leaders, condemned the killing and called for speedy investigations. Sam Otieno, the chairman of the Migori Contractors Association, said they were saddened by the brutal murder of one of their members. &quot;We were with Jamasai yesterday. This might be political but we&#39;ll leave investigations to the police,&quot; he said. By the time police responded to the shooting, the attackers had already fled. Witnesses said the attack occurred very fast and the gunmen&#39;s exact number could not be established. &quot;We will be relying on the police to unmask the killers. They appear to have known their way well and must have camped outside the house for some time, waiting for the best time to strike,&quot; a witness said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
