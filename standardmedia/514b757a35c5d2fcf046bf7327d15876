Two police&nbsp;officers&nbsp;arrested&nbsp;over&nbsp;the&nbsp;killing&nbsp;of a&nbsp;man&nbsp;in a&nbsp;hospital&nbsp;in Mwingi were arraigned in a Machakos court. The&nbsp;officers&nbsp;of the rank of inspector and corporal attached to the Kitui DCI&nbsp;office&nbsp;were&nbsp;arrested&nbsp;following the&nbsp;killing&nbsp;of Fredrick Musyimi, 27, at Mwingi Level Four&nbsp;Hospital. The prosecution requested the court to deny the media permission to take photographs. &ldquo;Since we are going to have an identification parade in 10 days&rsquo; time we request the media not to take pictures because once they are published they will interfere with completion of the investigations,&rdquo; the prosecutor requested the magistrate&rsquo;s court. Before the two suspects appeared in the dock, Machakos Deputy Registrar Lucy Kaitany asked journalists to leave and the court&rsquo;s doors were locked. &ldquo;I hereby accept conditions of the application which has been made today and will only be recorded in court in camera. I also request that no photographs be taken for publication of the media,&rdquo; Ms Kaitany said.

The two will take plea for the murder of the young&nbsp;man&nbsp;in Mwingi as the probe goes on,&rdquo; Mr Boinnet said. Lackluster response Investigators handling the saga say they intend to&nbsp;arrest&nbsp;more&nbsp;officers. &ldquo;There seem to be more players in this thing and we expect to&nbsp;arrest&nbsp;even the driver who was with them,&rdquo; said an&nbsp;officer. The police had earlier come under fire after details of the&nbsp;killing&nbsp;pointed to the possibility of involvement of uniformed&nbsp;officers&nbsp;in the macabre assassination of the hawker and a lacklustre response when a surviving witness sought protection from police after it emerged that her life was in danger.
