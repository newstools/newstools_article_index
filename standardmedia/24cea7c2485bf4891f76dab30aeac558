The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) is expected to name a new Chief Justice on Thursday. The commissioners are currently on a retreat to deliberate over the best candidate to replace Willy Mutunga after concluding interviews for 12 candidates who applied for the position. Sources at JSC said the commissioners would be guided by the Judicial Service Commission Act, which mandates them to name the successful applicant within seven days after the conclusion of interviews. Ann Amadi, the JSC secretary who doubles up as the Judiciary&#39;s chief registrar will be responsible for administering the voting and will declare the voting complete after all the applicants have been considered and all members have voted. &quot;The JSC Act is very clear on what follows at the end of the interviews. That is what is guiding us as we go through the selection process,&quot; said the source. Those interviewed were Supreme Court judges Jackton Ojwang and Smokin Wanjala, Court of Appeal judges Alnasir Visram, David Maraga and Roselyn Nambuye, and High Court judge Mbogholi Msagha, retired judge Aaron Ringera, senior counsel Nzamba Kitonga, US-based law lecturer Makau Mutua, Daniel Wambura and Lucy Wanja. Paul Udoto opted out.
