A former employee of an investment corporation in Meru clashed with her former employer at a court in Nyeri on Thursday over claims that he had attempted to slap her. Miriam Nkatha, the former Director of Corporate Services at the Meru County Investment and Development Corporation, has sued the firm for alleged unfair dismissal after she was fired on June 9. Nkatha convinced the court to declare that the actions of the corporation&rsquo;s Managing Director, Joel Imitira, were inhuman and damaged her reputation. When she was fired, Nkatha said, the MD sent security officers to her office and they frisked and kicked her out. Imitira testified,&nbsp;however, that Nkatha mismanaged public finances, and constantly and blatantly contravened procurement laws in a manner likely to expose the corporation to sanctions.
