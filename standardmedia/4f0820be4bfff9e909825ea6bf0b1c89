As campaigns for the 2017 elections begin in earnest, a host of&nbsp;senior&nbsp;state officials in Central and South Rift regions are expected to resign to contest various seats. A survey by The Standard on Sunday indicates most of those keen to resign are&nbsp;county&nbsp;executive committee (CEC) members, chief&nbsp;officers, departmental directors and commissioners ofcounty&nbsp;public service Boards in Nakuru, Narok, Bomet, Baringo, Samburu and neighbouring Nyahururu and Laikipia&nbsp;counties. Most of them are already engaged in early campaigns as they undertake their&nbsp;county&nbsp;governments functions. Their expected resignations are likely to put the&nbsp;county&nbsp;governments in a dilemma as crucial departments will be left without key&nbsp;officers. Civil rights activist Paul Masese says mass resignations will jeopardise the functioning of the devolved governments as the officials are likely to relinquish their positions almost at the same time. &ldquo;The&nbsp;County&nbsp;Government Act is silent on what happens when&nbsp;senior&nbsp;officials resign to join politics. It is the first time this will happen in&nbsp;counties,&rdquo; says Mr Masese.

The&nbsp;county&nbsp;government is an institution with structures and we have planned well for those kind of situations,&rdquo; he said. The elections law requires public servants interested in seeking elective seats to resign six months to the elections, which are scheduled for August 8, 2017. This means a host of public servants, among them cabinet secretaries, principal secretaries, heads of government agencies and parastatal chiefs and even teachers, have to tender in their resignations at least six months to the General Election. Elected leaders &mdash; the president, his deputy, governors, deputy governors, MPs, senators and MCAs &mdash; are however exempted from this requirement. In Nakuru, at least seven&nbsp;senior&nbsp;officials have already declared their intentions to contest various seats in and outside the&nbsp;county. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
