Police shot three people after the public tried to stop them from towing a car involved in an accident. Another person sustained injuries following a stampede that followed the shooting at Usenge in Bondo sub-county. The shot victims were last evening fighting for their lives at the Bondo sub-county hospital where they were rushed by the same officers. The incident was the second in the sub-county in less than a month. Three weeks ago, police shot dead three people as they foiled an attempt to lynch two women suspected of stealing a baby from Siaya County Referral Hospital. Two died at the scene while the third succumbed at the Jaramogi&nbsp; Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital while undergoing treatment.
