A court has ordered investigations into an incident where two strangers made their way into Shimo La Tewa Prison. The strangers are said to have taken fingerprints from three female inmates facing terrorism charges. Mombasa Principal Magistrate Diana Mochache demanded a review of the prison&#39;s CCTV footage to identify the alleged strangers. The incident was disclosed by defence lawyer, Jared Magolo, who claimed that his clients had told him they were roughed up by strangers who forcibly took their fingerprints in his absence. The lawyer did not specify when the breach occurred. Ms Mochache, who is leading the trial at Shanzu Law Courts, directed that a report on the incident be made at Mtwapa Police Station and investigations launched immediately. The suspects; Nasteho Ali Thalil, Luul Ali Tahlil and Zam Zam Abdi through their lawyer told the court that they no longer felt safe after the incident. The three were charged and detained with conspiracy to commit terrorism and withholding information that could have prevented a terror attack at a station.
