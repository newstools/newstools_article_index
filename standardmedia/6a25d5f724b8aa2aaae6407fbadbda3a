Lusaka: Zambia&#39;s government will proceed with plans to inaugurate President Edgar Lungu as the Constitutional Court&#39;s extension beyond a 14-day deadline of the opposition&#39;s legal challenge to the vote is illegal, a government source said on Sunday. Lungu&#39;s inauguration after an Aug. 11 election was postponed because his rival Hakainde Hichilema challenged the result in court, saying the vote was rigged. A law introduced in January says the winner of a presidential vote cannot be sworn in if their victory is contested in a court. When his lawyers quit, Zambia&#39;s Constitutional Court granted Hichilema an extension to hear and rule on the case beyond last Friday&#39;s cut-off date to give him more time to present his case. But the government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the extension was in breach of Zambia&#39;s laws. &quot;The constitutional provision ... says that they cannot go beyond 14 days and hearing the case beyond last Friday means they will be hearing the case outside the constitutional provision,&quot; he said. Lungu was consulting his lawyers over the court extension, his spokesman said, and the government would issue a statement on Monday.
