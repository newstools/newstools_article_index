Former Vice President Moody Awori says he oversaw the purchase of the controversial Sh8 billion Karen land 33 years ago. In documents filed in court, Mr Awori said he was a director of Muchanga Limited when the land was transferred from Barclays Bank. He said he attended a board of directors meeting on April 29, 1983, that resolved to charge the land with Barclays for Sh10.5 million. Awori was both a director of Muchanga Limited and Da Gama Rose Investments, which used the land title to borrow from Barclays. The former VP filed his affidavit last Friday to support claims by businessman Horatius Da Gama Rose, now deceased, that he purchased the land from Barclays in 1983. Dimitri Da Gama Rose, a general manager with Muchanga Limited, has since taken his father&#39;s place in the case.

Yesterday, parties to the suit appeared before Justice Lucy Gacheru who directed them to return to court on October 31 when she will give a hearing date. Original owner Awori&#39;s affidavit now corroborates the statement by Barclays Bank that denied any involvement in the alleged illegal transfer of the 134 acres in Karen. The bank said it never had any contract with John Mugo but instead oversaw the transfer of the land from the original owner, Arnold Bradley, to Horatius Da Gama Rose. Barclays Director of Legal Services Waweru Mathenge said the lender held the land title as a charge for a loan taken by Mr Rose between 1983 and 1989, when it released a certificate of discharge after he completed servicing the loan.
