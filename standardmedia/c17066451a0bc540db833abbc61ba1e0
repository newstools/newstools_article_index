Ford Kenya leaders and delegates have endorsed Senator Boni Khalwale to contest for Kakamega gubernatorial seat on the party ticket. Party leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula and MPs Chris Wamalwa (Kiminini), James Lusweti (Kabuchai), Ferdinand Wanyonyi (Kwanza), Wafula Wamunyinyi (Kanduyi) and Suleiman Murunga (Kimilili) vowed to ensure Khalwale wins the seat. Speaking in Kakamega, the group said Khalwale is the right person to lead the county and accused the incumbent, Wycliffe Oparanya, of abetting corruption. Wetang&#39;ula said he is confident Khalwale will guard against misuse of public resources. &quot;Khalwale might have a weakness but he is not a thief. He cannot misuse public funds. Some governors are using funds to campaign and ferrying people to attend their political rallies,&quot; Wetang&#39;ula said. Wamalwa who has also declared interest for Trans Nzoia governorship said if Khalwale wins the seat he will be voted to chair the Council of Governors (CoG).
