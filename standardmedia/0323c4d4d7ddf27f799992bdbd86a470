A section of leaders want courts to keep off the impeachment case of Governor Nderitu Gachagua. The leaders accused the Judiciary of usurping the roles of other constitutional institutions such as the Senate. Led by Kieni MP Kanini Kega, the leaders blamed courts for making decisions reserved for other independent arms of government, which later affects the people at the grassroots. They also took a swipe at leaders fond of rushing to court for injunctions against graft charges. &quot;Our courts are failing the country and its people and it is high time they play the role that has been stipulated for them in the Constitution,&quot; stated Kega. Kega added that governors have formed the habit of rushing to court after mismanaging public funds. He alleged that Mr Gachagua was planning to move to court to block his impeachment.

David Kinaniri, an aspiring Mukurwe-ini MP, also accused the courts of lacking respect for churches by making decisions that do not conform to church constitutions. &quot;Courts have lost respect for alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, this is overstepping their mandate,&quot; Kinaniri said.
