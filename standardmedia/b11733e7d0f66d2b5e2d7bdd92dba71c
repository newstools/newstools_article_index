Chaos in the Nairobi county assembly derailed a motion to impeach Governor Evans Kidero. An MCA, who was set to table the motion before the House yesterday, was roughed up by his colleague, throwing the Chamber into chaos. The commotion forced Deputy Speaker Ken Ngondi to adjourn the session to next week, adding that he was not aware if the motion had followed the right steps before it was taken to the House. &quot;I am not sure who started the fight because it became chaotic all of a sudden. All I could do was to adjourn the assembly because the House business could not go on,&quot; Mr Ngondi said. Dandora Phase Four MCA Dan Oria, walked towards Viwandani ward MCA Samuel Nyangw&#39;ara and grabbed the document and pushed him before other MCAs joined in the fight. The Sergeants-at-Arms tried to protect him in vain. The other CORD members swiftly joined in, throwing kicks and blows at the MCA who quickly sought protection from the Sergeants-at-arm.

Shortly after, CORD MCAs got into a war of words with their Jubilee counterparts and started chanting, &quot;Yote yawezekana bila Nyangw&#39;ara&quot; and &quot;Msalitii&quot; in unison. Nyangw&#39;ara was whisked out of the assembly as members threw water bottles and other objects at him. &quot;My attack today was as a result of fear from CORD MCAs who knew the motion would go through, and they are aware that the contents of the motion are factual. I am even more determined to move the motion again,&quot; he said.
