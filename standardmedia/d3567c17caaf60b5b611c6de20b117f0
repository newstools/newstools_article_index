Mr Cholmondeley, who was born on June 19, 1968 was rushed to the hospital with pain in his hip, which needed a replacement. His friends and relatives thronged the hospital following news of the death. He lived in Naivasha and Nairobi. The first Delamere came to Kenya in November 1897 and earned himself a name for amassing land and promoting the superiority of the British settlers. As the president of the colonists in the 1920s, Delamere wanted Kenya to be transformed into a white man&rsquo;s country and was violently opposed to the settling of Asians in the country. The only other Delamere who propelled the family into international spotlight was Lady Delamere, who featured prominently in the murder of a Casanova aristocrat, Lord Errol, whose death in 1941 has forever remained a mystery.&nbsp; Tom, who has been out of limelight for some years now, leaves behind two teenage sons and a fianc&eacute;e, Ms Sarah Dudnesh.
