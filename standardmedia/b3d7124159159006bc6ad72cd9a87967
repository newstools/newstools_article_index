Former Lands Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu says Kitui County Government has failed in its responsibility to provide water and other essential amenities to people living in Endau/Malalani Ward. Mrs Ngilu accused Governor Julius Malombe&#39;s administration of sidelining and balkanising residents in the ward located in Kitui East Constituency. &quot;This is pathetic in an era of devolution. You cannot imagine people in a certain area in Kitui cannot access a water point in a radius of 30 kilometres,&quot; she said. - Paul Mutua
