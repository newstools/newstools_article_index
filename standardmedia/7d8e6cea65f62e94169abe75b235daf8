A Parliamentary committee wants non-performing parastatals disbanded. State corporations targeted by the Public Investments Committee (PIC) in its report include those performing non-strategic functions but which rely heavily on the government for funding. In the report, PIC said any relevant functions performed by the agencies to be disbanded should be transferred to other government departments. The committee chaired by Wajir West MP Aden Keynan also called for restructuring and privatisation of other corporations to reduce the financial burden on Treasury. In their 2013-2014 audit, the team listed the Horticulture Crops and Development Authority, National Museums of Kenya, Pyrethrum Board of Kenya, Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) and South Nyanza Sugar Limited among those facing financial challenges. In the 2013-2014 financial year, 181 state corporations gobbled up Sh419.55 billion, an increase from Sh376.5 billion allocated in 2011-2012. About 40 per cent of the money went to recurrent expenditures.
