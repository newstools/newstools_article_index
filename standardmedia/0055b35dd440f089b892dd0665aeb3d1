The Ministry of Interior has criticised Bungoma County government for legalising busaa. In March, Governor Ken Lusaka gazetted the Bungoma County Alcoholic Drinks Control Act 2015 to regulate the production, sale, distribution and consumption of traditional brews including busaa. The governor further instructed security officers in the county to allow local residents to consume traditional brews without fear of arrest. But Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho said it was wrong for the county to contradict the national laws that criminalise busaa. Mr Kibicho maintained that busaa remains banned and any laws formulated by counties to allow its consumption were null and void. &quot;We understand that Bungoma has created a law allowing the sale and drinking of busaa. That is null and void because no county can create a law that contradicts the laws of the country,&quot; he said.

Repeal act He said the Act passed by the county government should be repealed as it was an illegality. The PS maintained that the government would not relent in the fight against illicit brews, including busaa. He said busaa must pass standard specifications for human consumption before it can be legalised. &quot;It must meet health, preservation and manufacturing standards, and be certified by the Kenya Bureau of Standards without which it will remain illegal,&quot; he said.
