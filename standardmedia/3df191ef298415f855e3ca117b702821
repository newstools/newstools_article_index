Parliament has rejected a proposal to pay Sh20 million to families of Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) soldiers disabled or killed in action. Also rejected was a proposal to waive all fees or tuition charges in all public institutions of learning up to college level for children of KDF staff. The proposed amendments to the Kenya Defence (Amendment) Bill sponsored by Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma were disallowed by Speaker Justin Muturi, who ruled that it had financial implications. Mr Muturi said the extent of the financial implications of the proposed changes had not been determined, and that the House had not made any legislative provisions to meet the consequent budgetary requirements. This means families and relatives of KDF will have to wait longer to receive any compensation from the government for loved ones who suffer death or any form of disability while on duty. Muturi argued that the Budget and Appropriations Committee chaired by Mbeere South MP Mutava Musyimi should have consulted with National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich before the House considered&nbsp; the amendments.
