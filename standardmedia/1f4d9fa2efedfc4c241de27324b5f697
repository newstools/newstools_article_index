&nbsp; The National Police Service has issued a vehicle to officers posted to Kibish sub-county along the Kenya-Ethiopia border. Area Sub-county Commissioner Eric Wanyoyi said the vehicle replaces donkey transport, which police officers in the region had relied on for decades. He said the vehicle will serve Kemothia and Lokamarinyang colonial police posts to boost ground mobility. &ldquo;Finally their cries have been heard. The officers have been issued with a new vehicle that will serve two border police posts. There has been transport hitch in the region which had been affecting security operations,&rdquo; Mr Wanyonyi said. He said the officers are forced to travel more than 400km to Lodwar in search of network to communicate with their families.
