Seven&nbsp;suspects, including a woman, have been&nbsp;arrested&nbsp;for&nbsp;kidnapping&nbsp;and robbing former MP Maoka Maore&#39;s personal assistant. They also demanded a Sh500,000 ransom from him. The&nbsp;seven&nbsp;were&nbsp;arrested&nbsp;in Pipeline Estate from three different houses that they used interchangeably as they tortured Lewis Eng&#39;ang&#39;a for hours. Police say they held Mr Eng&#39;ang&#39;a and withdrew money from his bank and M-Pesa accounts while crowd-sourcing for funds from relatives and friends by sending them messages asking them to channel money to his mobile phone. Maore said Eng&#39;gang&#39;a had been sent to a garage in Industrial Area on Wednesday at around 2pm. As he was walking from Landi Mawe towards Bunyala Road, he was accosted by four people near a petrol station and forced into a van. They then ordered him to give them his mobile phone, driving license, Sh16,000 in cash and ATM cards. Nairobi County Police Commander Japhet Koome said the police recovered 15 mobile phones, several SIM cards and Sh49,500 in cash from the suspects. Koome added that the police are looking for another suspect whom he said is armed. He requested the public to help the police locate him.
