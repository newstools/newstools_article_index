All is set today as Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka starts a tour of the Coast. Kalonzo&rsquo;s Mombasa tour is seen as an onslaught on Raila Odinga&rsquo;s and President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s earlier tours of the populous Coastal region in search of votes. Raila completed his tour on Wednesday last week just a week after Kenyatta&rsquo;s foray in the region in search of 2017 votes. Yesterday, Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar said Kalonzo will focus his campaign in Mombasa as his party steps up efforts to wrestle the gubernatorial seat from ODM&rsquo;s Hassan Joho in next year&rsquo;s elections. Hassan, who accompanied and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti spoke during a tour of Tononoka Grounds, where Kalonzo will address a rally on Sunday. While on his campaign trail, Kalonzo is expected to endorse Senator Hassan for the Mombasa gubernatorial seat and assure aspirants of free and fair nominations. The leaders said they will work on a joint strategy on how to unseat the now popular Joho in the August 2017 General Elections. Grand rally Hassan also said Kalonzo will launch his bid to take over the country&rsquo;s top most job. &ldquo;Change will start from the seaside. We will move across the country selling our policies which include giving equal opportunities to women and youth for the overall development of the country,&rdquo; said Omar. Kalonzo&rsquo;s itinerary shows he will tour six constituencies before crowing it with a major rally at the historic Tononoka grounds tomorrow. Hassan said the over 30 elected Wipers leaders will make what he termed as &lsquo;three Tononoka declarations&rsquo; on national and county government politics. Today, the party&rsquo;s convoy will start at Akamba Handcraft in Changamwe constituency and pass through Jomvu constituency&rsquo;s Mikindani area, Kongowe (Nyali) and Bamburi (Kisauni).
