Turkana: Two partners in the Coalition for Reforms and democracy (CORD) are fielding separate candidates in an upcoming by-election. Ford-Kenya and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) will battle it out in the Kalokol ward by-election scheduled for October 26. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) confirmed it had cleared Simon Ekai Nang&#39;iro (Jubilee Party), Michael Epem Ebenyo (Ford-Kenya), Joseph Ekeno Emuria (ODM) and Peter Lotengan Emana (independent candidate) to vie for the MCA seat. The seat fell vacant following the death of John Lolimo (Ford-Kenya). Both Jubilee Party and ODM have intensified their campaigns in the ward in a bid to showcase their political supremacy in the county. The ODM campaign is being led by the Governor Josphat Nanok while Senator John Munyes is leading the Jubilee campaign team. The senator is eyeing the governor&#39;s seat on a Jubilee Party ticket in 2017.

The ODM team on the other hand accused the ruling party of planning to rig the by-election. The IEBC has denied allegations of planned rigging. &quot;We are governed by the Constitution and electoral laws. Our mandate as part of the electoral body is to ensure a free and fair election process is conducted.
