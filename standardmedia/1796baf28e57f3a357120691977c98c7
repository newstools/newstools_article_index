KAKAMEGA: A traffic police officer yesterday told a vetting panel in Kakamega that he once helped National Police Service Commission (NPSC) Chairman Johnston Kavuludi out of a traffic jam. &ldquo;I helped you overcome a traffic jam in Kakamega during Prophet David Owuor&rsquo;s meeting,&rdquo; Corporal Daniel Ekwam reminded Kavuludi. He had been asked if he had rendered any exemplary service in his career. Ekwam left the NPSC panel in fits of laughter as Kavuludi thanked him for the gesture. &ldquo;I remember you bwana officer and I remain thankful,&rdquo; said Kavuludi of the 2013 incident when Prophet Owuor of Repentance and Holiness ministry visited Kakamega for a religious revival. . Ekwam also reminded Kavuludi on the numerous times he had &ldquo;greeted him at the Kakamega Nakumatt Supermarket&rdquo;.

He visits the&nbsp;police station and after some discussions we are ordered by our seniors to free his people,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Ekwam. The commission, however, reminded him that he was under obligation to comply with the law. &ldquo;The law empowers you to stand firm against such people. You must block stubborn politicians and with time they will develop respect for you. You can even make them sleep in cells, just like you should arrest me when I break the law,&rdquo; Kavuludi responded. The commission learnt that Ekwam lost his national identity card in addition to his KCPE and KCSE certificates&nbsp;during his transfer from Garissa to Nyari &nbsp; in 2008. Ekwam&rsquo;s must have been the shortest session during the vetting of the 150 Western Kenya-based officers. He had told the panel that his father had died and the burial was slated for Wednesday. &ldquo;I have come before you and, in honour of my departed father, will give an honest account of my professional conduct,&rdquo; he told the panel.
