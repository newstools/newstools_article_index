Asha Ahmed Mwilu and Rashid Iddi shared the overall &lsquo;CNN MultiChoice African Journalist of the Year&rsquo; Award for their report titled &lsquo;Terror Crossing&rsquo; aired on &ldquo;The Lead&rdquo;, an investigative broadcast by the country&rsquo;s premier television station, Kenya Television Network (KTN). The winning entry was chosen from a record number of 1,637 stories. The Standard Group journalists were ranked the best among 38 finalists at a colourful gala in South Africa on Saturday night. Asha and Rashid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Terror Crossing&rsquo; is an in-depth investigative documentary about security on the Kenya-Somalia border in Mandera County. Kenyans within the audience responded with applause and cheers as the winners were announced at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Johannesburg. PRESTIGIOUS AWARD &ldquo;I am happy at winning this prestigious award and I thank my mother who always stood by me as I worked on the stories. I also thank my colleagues at KTN and SG newsroom, Wellington Nyongesa and the video editors who made it possible for the entry to win,&rdquo; said Asha. Asha challenged female journalists to go for hard news even as their male counterparts shone at the event. Iddi dedicated the win to his family. Dominic Omondi, a business writer with The Standard, also received a commendation for his piece, &ldquo;How thriving &lsquo;reject economy&rsquo; is allowing the poor to live high life of the rich&rdquo;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a high-impact story told in the wake of Kenya&rsquo;s plans to build a wall at her border with Somalia,&rdquo; judges said. Asha is currently pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree at the University for the Creative Arts, Farnham, having received the 2015-2016 Chevening Scholarship. Iddi has worked in various media houses, with experience spanning 13 years, and is currently a senior cameraman for KTN. Standard Group CEO Sam Shollei, who was present at the event, was elated at the feat by Standard Group staff.
