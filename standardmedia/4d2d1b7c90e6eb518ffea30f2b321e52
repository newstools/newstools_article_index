Kisumu Town Central MP Ken Obura, who has been at loggerheads with his ODM party over his alleged dalliance with the Government, has told off his critics, saying he will retain his seat with a landslide. Obura boasted that he has the best development record and it will only take him seven days to campaign and retain his seat. &quot;I know some of my colleagues are only bothered by my development projects. I will continue to serve my people,&quot; he said. He further claims he had no bad blood with ODM, but some people were unhappy with his close partnership with the national government to bring development.&nbsp;
