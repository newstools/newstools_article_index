The government has set aside Sh200 million to promote innovations that will make agriculture attractive to the youth. Willy Bett, the Agriculture Cabinet Secretary said the Agri-Revolution Forum will go a long way in making agriculture alluring to people between 18 and 40 years. &lsquo;&rsquo;We want to encourage the youth to use technology to invest in agriculture to boost food security. It&rsquo;s unfortunate the average age for farmers in this country is 60 years,&rdquo; he said. Bett added: &ldquo;We want to incorporate the youth who are energetic and creative to employ technology in agriculture&rdquo;. The Cabinet Secretary said the State is working on a programme to involve the youth in agribusiness to help grow the economy.
