President&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;Kenyatta has&nbsp;asked&nbsp;those with land through which infrastructural&nbsp;projects&nbsp;are passing through to surrender it. Otherwise, the President said the government will forcibly seize it. The President said a few individuals will not be allowed to stand in the way of&nbsp;projects&nbsp;that could save billions of shillings wasted in traffic jams. He blamed&nbsp;landowners&nbsp;for delaying theprojects. &nbsp;&quot;Nairobi loses Sh147 billion per year due to traffic jams,&quot; the President said. &quot;But there are people who don&#39;t want to move and give way to&nbsp;projects&nbsp;that could save us this money. A big chunk of our expenditure is taken by infrastructural&nbsp;projects,&quot; he added. Uhuru&nbsp;expressed his sentiments yesterday when he commissioned the dualling of Ngong Road. The 2.7-kilometre road is expected to be complete by July next year. It will cost Sh1.5 billion and runs from the Kenya National Library Services headquarters to Ring Road Kilimani. It will expanded from two to four lanes while junctions will have six lanes. The President spoke at a time when the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and Outering Road in Nairobi have been delayed due to compensation issues.

That is why we are opening up roads and building roads. When SGR is complete, cargo will be transported by it so that we free our roads,&quot; he added. Uhuru&nbsp;at the same time cautioned contractors to stick to set timelines to complete&nbsp;projects&nbsp;on time. He also called on agencies responsible for road safety to do more to avert traffic accidents. &quot;Our safety records need to improve and the number of casualties on our roads is unacceptable. We are building new roads to improve safety and not increase deaths,&quot;&nbsp;Uhuru&nbsp;said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
