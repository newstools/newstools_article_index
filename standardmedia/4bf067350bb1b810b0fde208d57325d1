Nairobi: Two policemen are missing after Somali Islamists attacked a police base in northeastern Kenya early on Thursday, a police spokesman said, the latest in a string of cross-border raids by the al Shabaab militia. Fighters in two Landcruisers attacked the patrol base &quot;but the officers in the camp managed to repulse them amid (a) fierce exchange of fire,&quot; said a statement from police spokesman George Kinoti. One policeman was wounded and two were missing, he said, adding that one attacker was killed. Al Shabaab claimed the attack in Kenya&#39;s Garissa County. &quot;We attacked a police station in a small town near Garissa last night,&quot; al Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab told Reuters by phone. Al Shabaab have repeatedly attacked Kenya, saying it is in retaliation for Kenyan troops entering Somalia in 2011 in a bid to secure the porous border between the two nations.
