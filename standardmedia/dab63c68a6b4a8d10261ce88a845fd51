Witnesses said the gunmen were heavily armed and took almost three hours to accomplish their mission before driving off. More officers were deployed to the area to carry out air and ground surveillance as the hunt on the gunmen went on in vain. They had crossed into Somalia. National police spokesman George Kinoti said the attack happened at about midnight. &quot;Over 50 terrorists attacked the Police patrol Base in two Land Cruisers but the officers in the camp managed to repulse them amid fierce exchange of fire,&quot; he said. Kinoti said the attackers retreated and later returned in a bigger number in a lorry and fired three bombs into the camp destroying some tents thus forcing the officers to withdraw for cover. &quot;All officers have been accounted for except two. One has been airlifted to Nairobi for specialized treatment after suffering gunshots.&quot; Three others were taken to the nearby Dadaab hospital with minor injuries. Kinoti praised the officers for the fight they put to contain the gang. More officers were sent to the area to pursue the gunmen but no recovery was made. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
