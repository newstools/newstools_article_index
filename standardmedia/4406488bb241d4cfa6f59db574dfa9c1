Nderitu Gachagua will remain the governor for Nyeri County after the Senate unanimously voted against the motion to impeach him. The County Assembly had accused Gachagua of gross violation of the Constitution, County Government Act, Public Finance Management Act and Public Procurement and Disposal Act, abuse of office and gross misconduct and failure to comply with the law. &nbsp;They argued that the governorship of Gachagua is no longer tenable Gachagua had defended himself saying the MCAs&#39; bid to remove him was driven by external political forces, particularly singling out former Mathira MP Ephraim Maina, whom he claimed had hosted the county legislators in planning the impeachment. Under the abuse of office charges, the county assembly faulted Gachagua for appointing several officers under the executive in an acting capacity, with some holding the portfolios for as long as one year and four months. The Senate that sat until late evening on Wednesday voted to save the governor. Other governors who have survived efforts to oust them from office are Martin Wambora (Embu), Paul Chepkwony (Kericho), Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni) and Mwangi wa Iria of Murang&rsquo;a.
