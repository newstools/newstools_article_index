A magistrate has been accused of being lenient to suspects in a Sh20 million tax fraud case. The Mombasa-based magistrate freed nine Kenya Ports Authority and Kenya Revenue Authority employees on a Sh50,000 bond or cash bail of Sh10,000 each. However, Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko said that was too lenient and applied to have the bonds enhanced. Justice Dorcas Chepkwony is expected to rule on the DPP&#39;s application on November 1. Prosecutor Daniel Wamotsa told Justice Chepkwony the trial magistrate misdirected himself on bail terms by giving the accused persons, who were facing tax evasion charges, a bail of such a huge amount. &quot;She gave very lenient bond terms when the case involves tax evasion of Sh20 million, which is an economic crime,&quot; said Wamotsa. However, defence lawyer Jared Magolo said the High Court can only reduce, and not increase, bond terms.
