Ambassador Daniel Waisiko Wambura, however, remained defiant, saying he has no apologies over the disputed presidential election results. He said his only regret was the chaos that followed announcement of the results. &quot;There is nothing I did that could make someone win or lose the election. I don&#39;t regret being a commissioner with ECK, only the events that followed announcement of presidential results. We conducted the election, got results and announced what we believed was right,&quot; said Wambura. His appointment to ECK just two months to the General Election, also came into question. The Judicial Service Commission officials said he was hurriedly appointed to the position without an interview. Wambura said he was notified of a vacancy at ECK and told to apply after which he was appointed.

This was after he admitted he has never practised as a lawyer since he was admitted as an advocate in 1996. In response to commissioner Aggrey Muchelule&#39;s question, he said his worst moment was when everyone blamed them after the elections.
