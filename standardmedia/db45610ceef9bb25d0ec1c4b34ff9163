Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has declared that he will not participate in Wiper Party&#39;s nominations if Senator David Musila remains the party chairman. Mr Malombe said it is unacceptable that Mr Musila retains the party chairmanship while he harbours ambitions for the governor&#39;s seat in next year&#39;s general elections. Without specifying his options, the governor said the senator&#39;s resolve to stay put would compromise the party primaries, triggering mass defections. &quot;We will not waver in our demand that party officials interested in running for county positions should first relinquish their positions to have a level playing ground,&quot; he said. Mr Malombe has in the past accused Musila, Kitui East MP Marcus Muluvi, who is also Wiper&#39;s director of elections, and Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze of a conspiracy to deny him the party ticket.
