NAIROBI: No school bus is allowed to operate at night, transport authority has directed. There should also be no music, videos or musical instruments being played in the bus when on the road. In a set of guidelines on school transport by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA), school buses are now required to be inspected twice every year. In the wake of recent fatal accidents involving school children, NTSA has seen it wise to bring the regulations in light as counter measure in the relatively abandoned transport sub sector. In the newly published NTSA guidelines, the responsibility of school driver recruitment should involve both the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) and the institution&#39;s administration. A driver shall be at least 21 years of age with a valid commercial license, and possess a clean criminal record that will be reviewed annually. It adds that no other person other than a pupil, teacher, school official, aide, driver in training or substitute driver shall be permitted to ride on a school bus while transporting pupils.
