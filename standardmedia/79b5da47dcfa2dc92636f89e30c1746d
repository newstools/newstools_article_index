The county government has banned sand harvesting in Voi River to prevent the water system from drying up. The ban comes after the river almost dried up following widespread sand harvesting and many complaints from locals who depend on it. The river is also a source of water for livestock and the wildlife in Tsavo National Park. Environment Executive Alexander Mwangeka said the river was the main source of water to Aruba Dam in Tsavo East National Park and its drying up would adversely affect tourism. Brick making along the river has also been banned.
