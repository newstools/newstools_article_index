Nominated Senator Janet Ong&#39;era has told off Kisii Senator Chris Obure on the ongoing unity talks and efforts to rally the community behind Jubilee. On what is appearing to be a counter attack among ODM leaders in Kisii, Ms Ong&#39;era said Mr Obure no longer represents the party interests. The nominated senator took issue with Obure over his spirited effort to rally the community behind Jubilee in the next general elections saying he had betrayed ODM. Speaking on Monday in Kisii during the burial of Esther Nyaboke, wife to former Cabinet Minister Simon Nyachae, Ong&#39;era said the Kisii people have every democratic right to vote for their preferred candidate. &quot;Senator Obure is my political father and mentor but he is alone on his calls to support Jubilee. We must stay in the Opposition to keep this Government on toes. We need a strong Opposition as a country,&quot; said Ong&#39;era.
