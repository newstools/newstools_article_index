Governor Moses Akaranga has ruled out the possibility of dissolving his Progressive Party of Kenya to join Jubilee Party. Mr Akaranga, however, promised to work closely with the Jubilee administration to uplift the lives of locals. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t work with the one who has keys to the food store, your children will go hungry,&rdquo; said Akaranga. He said his good working relationship with the Government had seen various projects in the county including a Sh1.8 billion water project approved. The water project is sponsored by the Belgium government and aims to provide water for the five sub-counties in the county. &ldquo;On top of that, there are over five major roads in the county that have been earmarked for tarmacking. In view of that, I cannot fail to work with the Government,&rdquo; he said.
