A city businessman who recently received a cool Sh670 million payment compensation from the government is said to have gone silent on his key allies. Those complaining include a renowned city politician and senior officials from State infrastructure department who were shafted in the recent payment plan. According to sources he received the cash through his personal account overlooking his longtime lawyer who has been receiving previous huge payments on his behalf.
