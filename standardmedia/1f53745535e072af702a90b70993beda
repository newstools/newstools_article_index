The county assembly is investigating the circumstances under which a retired officer was reappointed to head the County Inspectorate Division. The Speaker of the County Assembly has directed the Labour committee chaired by Tsimba/Golini ward representative Swaleh Simba to investigate the matter. This emerged when Mkongani MCA Ndoro Mweruphe questioned the circumstances that led to a renewal of contract given to Mohammed Mvumbo, who was previously the head of the same department. Mr Mweruphe said Mr Mvumbo&#39;s reappointment has locked out other candidates who were qualified. He raised the matter in the assembly following a public outcry, with a number of county employees from the department threatening to go on strike. Speaking to the media, Mweruphe demanded an explanation from the County Public Service Board on the guidelines used to reappoint the officer. The MCA argued that the county had many experienced people who wished to offer their services to the county if given a chance. He feared that if the trend continued, then youths who are currently sponsored by the county government would not get jobs. &quot;I am not saying that this is bad, but if somebody&#39;s time in office comes to an end, then he should leave and make way for others,&quot; he said. A letter from the Department of Public Service and Administration signed by Chief Officer Nurein Mwatsahu directed Mvumbo to resume duty on October 5. In the letter copied to all enforcement officers, Mr Mwatsahu asked them to accord Mvumbo the necessary co-operation required to transform the image of the division. &quot;This is to inform you that Mr Mohammed Mvumbo has officially been awarded a contract by the County Government of Kwale and therefore resumes duty as from October 5,&quot; the letter read.
