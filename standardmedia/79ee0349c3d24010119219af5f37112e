&nbsp; A 38-year-old man suspected of sexually molesting scores of boys in Igikiro village in Murang&#39;a South has been charged in court. Enock Mwangi was arraigned before Kigumo resident magistrate, Agnes Mwangi, where he denied two counts of sexually molesting a 14 year old boy and infecting him with an STI. But the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges, saying he had been framed by the victim&#39;s mother after a relationship with her went sour. He denied that he suffered from a sexually transmitted disease. He was released on a Sh400,000 bond until December 21 when the matter will be heard. Local residents jammed the court to witness the proceedings. READ MORE Fight against HIV and AIDS Study underscores benefits of starting ARV treatment early
