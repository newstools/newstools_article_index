Religious leaders in Vihiga have asked Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale (above) to apologise for saying residents of the county were doomed for having elected a &lsquo;pastor&rsquo; to be their governor. Yesterday, the clerics said the remarks were in bad taste since pastors play an integral role in the community. &ldquo;Church leaders are not just found in leadership by chance, they merit. Servants of God are anointed and have a higher calling,&rdquo; said Francis Ludeki, secretary of Evangelical Alliance of Kenya, Vihiga chapter. The Kakamega senator made the ramarks last Saturday during a function at Kapsotik in Vihiga. &ldquo;You cannot entrust the county leadership with someone who only knows how to count church offerings,&rdquo; Khalwale was quoted saying. Governor Moses Akaranga is fondly referred to as Reverend due to the many years he served as an administrator at the Pentecostal Assemblies of God headquarters in Nyang&rsquo;ori. While noting Khalwale doesn&rsquo;t represent any interests of the people of Vihiga, Ludeki asked him to apologise to the church, saying no one has ever waged a war against the church and succeeded. &ldquo;We demand an apology or he will not be allowed to address any gathering chaired by religious leaders anywhere,&rdquo; said Ludeki.
