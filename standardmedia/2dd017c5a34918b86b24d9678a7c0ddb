The Government has launched &#39;special investigations&#39; into the financial accounts of some of the public universities. The Kenya National Audit Office is undertaking the investigation but Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i declined to reveal the institutions involved. He said a previous audit by the ministry revealed some universities may not have put public funds to good use. The revelations came days after another study by the Commission for University Education (CUE) disclosed that universities spent nearly a third of the monies they collected on &#39;other expenditures&#39;. The 2016 status of university education revealed that on &#39;other expenditures&#39;, the universities &ndash; public and private &ndash; spent Sh83.05 billion. &quot;On this expenditure item, public universities spent Sh60.74 billion while private universities spend Sh22.30 billion,&quot; reads the report. The report released during an international meeting on the status of higher education in Kenya brought together senior Education ministry officials, senior public and private universities&#39; management staff, international guests and researchers. The institutions of higher learning were faulted for their high affinity for money, a tendency that the report said &quot;is hurting quality education in Kenyan universities&quot;. The report shows that between 2010 and 2014, both public and private universities received a total of Sh345.9 billion. Of these, public institutions got Sh279.6 billion, with private universities collecting Sh66.3 billion. The report compiled sources of university funding based on four aspects &ndash; government capitation, student fees, research grants and other incomes. It revealed the universities spent more than half the monies collected on salaries. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
