Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) boss Ezekiel Mutua has been ordered to surrender his diplomatic passport to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mutua, who is in the US attending Google&#39;s Web Rangers Global Summit at its headquarters in Mountain View, California, kicked up a storm on social media when he posted his visa on Facebook in an imperious jibe at his detractors. &quot;Because of my moral values, including the banning of content promoting LGBT and atheists culture in Kenya, someone wrote in a local daily that I will never get a visa to the USA. I not only got it but it came on a diplomatic passport and I didn&#39;t even have to go to the Embassy for biometrics or pay the visa applications fee. It was delivered to my office free of charge thanks to our efficient Ministry of Foreign Affairs and highly courteous US embassy officials. America here we come. To God be the glory,&quot; said Mutua in the post. It drew instant fury from Kenyans online, who accused Mutua of bragging. &quot;He doesn&#39;t realise taxes from gay and atheist Kenyans alike not only pay his salary, but also paid for this short visa, does he?&quot; wrote TV journalist Ramah Nyang. It forced Immigration Service Director to issue a statement on how Mutua got the diplomatic passport. READ MORE Kenya Film Classification Board asks media to give hate mongers blackout
