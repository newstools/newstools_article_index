There are fears of a clash between ODM and Jubilee supporters in Nairobi after the parties gave notice to hold separate activities culminating in rallies at the same venue tomorrow. Leaders of the parties announced yesterday that they would wind up planned activities with rallies at Masinde Muliro grounds in Mathare, Nairobi, setting the stage for conflict. ODM plans to hold a rally to popularise its 2017 presidential candidate Raila Odinga at the grounds after a series of roadshows. And yesterday, Mathare MP Steven Kariuki, who recently defected from ODM to Jubilee, said he would use the same venue to popularise the new Jubilee Party and the leader President Uhuru Kenyatta, after inspecting development projects in his constituency. Mr Kariuki wrote to the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to provide security during the event. &ldquo;The purpose of this letter is to inform your office of a planned development project inspection tour which will culminate in a mass civic education rally in our beloved Mathare Constituency on Sunday September 18,&rdquo; reads the letter in part.
