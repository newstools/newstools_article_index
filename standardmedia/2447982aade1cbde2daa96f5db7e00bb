Lamu Governor Issa Timamy has defected to Musalia Mudavadi&#39;s Amani National Congress. Timamy had declared about a month ago that he will defend his seat on a Jubilee Party ticket in next year&#39;s polls. He said he decided to join ANC because he does not have faith in CORD and Jubilee. And reports from Kilifi indicate former Cabinet Secretary Kambi Kazungu has defected from Jubilee to Kadu Asili party on whose ticket he intends to vie for the Kilifi governor seat next year. Since losing his Cabinet post, he has been trying to resurrect his political career. Kadu Asili party secretary general Jimmy Ngala confirmed yesterday that Mr Kambi was now firmly in the party, saying he is the &quot;biggest catch&quot; this year as the country heads for elections. And Timamy, who made his announcement at Mwanaarafa Hall in Lamu on Monday, said he does not want unnecessary conflict with other contenders for the Jubilee ticket.
