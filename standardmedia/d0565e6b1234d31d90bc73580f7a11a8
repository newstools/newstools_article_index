Lupita Nyong&#39;o in action in the film Queen of Katwe that premiered in Kampala Saturday night. PHOTO: CURTESY Kenya&#39;s Oscar Award winner Lupita Nyong&#39;o&#39;s much-anticipated film premiered in Kampala at the weekend. The Disney World-produced movie has received positive reviews, with Lupita receiving acclaim for her role as Harriett, the mother of Phiona (Madina Nalwanga). Madina is debuting on the silver screen as a young 11-year-old talented chess player who wins the Uganda National Chess Challenge. The victory opens completely new horizons for girls born and bred in the sprawling slum of Katwe. The girls are often left homeless due to their challenging economic circumstances that do not allow regular income flow. Based on a true story, the film, Queen of Katwe, is directed by Mira Nair, the founder of Maisha Film Lab &ndash; a training programme for East Africans. This is where Lupita honed her acting skills before her big Hollywood breakthrough two years ago.

We can all be inspired by her love, authenticity and fearless pursuit to do the best for her children while she had so much working against her. I&#39;m grateful that Mira Nair chose me for this role and for the precious time that Harriet spent with me,&quot; said Lupita of her role and character, Harriet Nakku, on her Facebook page a day before the Kampala launch. According to Lupita, who won Kenya&#39;s first-ever Oscar for her sterling portrayal of Patsy in Steve McQueen&#39;s 12 Years A Slave, her role in this new film helped her appreciate motherhood better. &quot;My mother has been a major inspiration in my life. I kept calling her to apologise for all the mistakes I made when I was child as I tried to fit into this role,&quot; she said. Queen of Katwe also stars Nigerian rising film star David Oyelowo who acts as Phiona&#39;s chess trainer in a state that depicts an economically-deprived Africa but with dedicated people who are working hard to make a difference. &nbsp; HOLLYWOOD AUDIENCE GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
