Former Judiciary Chief Registrar Gladys&nbsp;Shollei&nbsp;says abuse of office&nbsp;charges&nbsp;against her lack facts and should be dismissed. Through lawyer Paul Ng&#39;arua,&nbsp;Shollei&nbsp;told the court yesterday she will make an application to have the&nbsp;charges&nbsp;struck out. Milimani Principal Magistrate Felix Kombo directed her to make the application during the next hearing next year. &quot;My client is aggrieved because she is prejudiced as the&nbsp;charges&nbsp;fail to address the mischief with any amount of sufficiency and certainty,&quot; said Ng&#39;arua. Ng&#39;arua said matters to do with procurement cannot be articulated well without specific information as prescribed in the law. &quot;The prosecution has failed to capture the essentials of the&nbsp;charge, making them incoherent,&quot; said Ng&#39;arua. Shollei&nbsp;is accused in a second corruption case relating to her tenure at the Judiciary.

The case arises from questionable procurement deals for construction of court buildings in Tawa, Mavoko and Garsen. &quot;The&nbsp;charges&nbsp;are ridiculous and trumped-up. What they are&nbsp;charging&nbsp;me with is not corruption nor loss of money but the decision made during the procurement,&quot;&nbsp;Shollei&nbsp;told journalists outside the courtroom. She is&nbsp;charged&nbsp;alongside seven former members of the tender committee who allegedly increased the advance downpayment for the constructions from 10 per cent to 50 per cent without approval. The seven are former deputy chief registrar Kakai Kissinger, Martin Otieno Okwata (former director of supply chain management), Benedict Abonyo Omollo (former director of finance) and tender committee members Wycliffe Wanga Ombunde, Nicholas Muturi Okemwa, Nicholas Mbeba and Thomas Oloo Atak. They are accused of failing to comply with procurement laws by awarding a direct tender to Timsales Ltd, which received the 50 per cent advance down payment instead of 10 per cent.
