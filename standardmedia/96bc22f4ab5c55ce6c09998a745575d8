Over 250,000 small-scale tea farmers in Mt Kenya region will in the next few days receive their bonuses. The bulk of the money will be paid out to small-scale tea farmers in Nyeri, Murang&#39;a, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Embu, Tharaka Nithi and Meru counties where the crop is widely cultivated. According to calculations being worked on by Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA), the bonuses for the&nbsp;2015-16 year will increase by 50 per cent compared to the previous year. Confidential KTDA data obtained by The Standard&nbsp;shows farmers across the region are expected to pocket between Sh40 and Sh48 per kilogramme, a significant improvement from previous years. What individual farmers are to take home, however, will depend on the different factories. Some factories will enjoy good prices due to quality of their tea and cost of production. In Kirinyaga, farmers affiliated to one factory have gone on the rampage over the impending payments (see separate story). But farmers associated with Mununga Factory in Kirinyaga are a happy lot after receiving Sh48.35, the highest amount in bonus. Those who take their green leaves to Kimunye will be paid Sh47.40 per kilo. Farmers affiliated to Ndima factory have received Sh45.50, Kangaita Sh42.26 and Thumaita Sh41.50.
