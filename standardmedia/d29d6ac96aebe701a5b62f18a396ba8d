&ldquo;I want to be left alone with my family. Enough is enough&rsquo;&rsquo;. These are the words of Nadya Ahmed Mohamed, 48, who has lost two of her sons to police bullets. Her son Ismael Mohamed Shosi was shot by police in Kisauni, Mombasa on Monday. The police radar is also focused on Ikrima, her third son, who has been branded a terror suspect. &ldquo;My son (Ikrima) is confined at home and cannot go out to look for a job since he has been branded a bad person by authorities. And you the media (not The Standard) have even published his pictures, saying he is wanted for terror-related activities,&rsquo;&rsquo; she told The Standard on Saturday. Nadya said she has not known peace since her first born son Idriss was felled by police bullets in 2014 after being linked to terrorism.

This is evident in the way even neighbours and landlords in whose houses I live tend to throw me out,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. Nadya says that because she&nbsp; is ostracised she has been forced to move houses five times since 2014. KILLED IN SHOOTOUT Shosi, who had a Sh2 million bounty on his head, was killed under mysterious circumstances on Monday, cut down by bullets to the head and chest. The official police account is that the man the State has blamed for virtually every violent crime in Mombasa in recent years, was killed in a shootout with anti-terrorism police. &ldquo;After Shosi&rsquo;s burial at Kikowani Muslim Cemetery, only a handful of mourners made their way to the family home for the traditional feast after burial, Nadya said. &ldquo;We had prepared a meal for mourners but a few turned up to share with us. We had to give the leftovers to our neighbours,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
