Eight people escaped death narrowly when an ambulance rushing two patients&nbsp; to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital crashed along Katito-Kisumu road, inflicting more injuries to the two patients. The ambulance which was being driven at high speed&nbsp; as the driver tried to save the lives of the patients, swerved, rolled three times at Ayweyo village in Nyakach. All the Eight people&nbsp; on board were rushed to Ahero County Hospital for medical attention only for the seven of them to be referred to JOOTRH. According to Joshua Maganga, the Administrator at Ahero County Hospital, there were two patients being rushed to JOOTRH from Nyakach, with one of them being a student at a school in Pap Onditi who was being accompanied by three relatives. &quot;We have very scanty information as at now because the patients have sustained injuries requiring urgent medical attention. What I have got so far is that the girl who was among the patients was being accompanied by close relatives,&quot; said Maganga. According to Julius Adika, an eye witness who rushed to the scene soon after the accident as his home is right next to the road, there were eight people on board but it was difficult to tell who was the patient as they all had various injuries and in great pain. Speaking to The Standard, the ambulance driver who identified himself as Silas said that he had just overtaken a truck when he lost control and the ambulance swerved to the edge of the road before rolling.
