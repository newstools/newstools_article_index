More than 800 health workers have threatened to go on strike to protest failure by the county to implement labour agreements. &nbsp;The health workers&#39; union said they had given the county government until September 26 to address the pending deal failing which they would down their tools. peaking yesterday, the union&#39;s national chairman, John Bii, said the union had engaged the county since 2014 to effect promotions and re-designations but nothing had been done.
