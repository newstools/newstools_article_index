&nbsp; The county government will construct 180 more nursery schools this financial year to cope with increased enrollment. Making the announcement, Governor Peter Munya said the education department had shortlisted more professionals to bring the ratio of nursery school teachers to pupils to 1:40. Munya said the county had constructed two nursery schools in each of the 45 wards, but some have three because of the high enrollment. &quot;We are going to provide the money for the construction of the new centres to development committees comprising three parents, the chairman of the school board, an education officer and a nursery school teacher. We want the money to go to the community, not contractors,&quot; he said.
