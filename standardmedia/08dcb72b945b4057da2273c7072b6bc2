About 30 small-scale farmers from Kiambu, Meru, Machakos and Makueni counties have begun a four-day campaign to promote chemical-free farming. The campaign will start in Thika and stop in Machakos, Makueni and Nairobi where they will exhibit chemical-free farm products, share farming techniques and distribute seeds. The campaign comes ahead of World Food Day on October 16. It is supported by Green Peace Africa, Kenya Biodiversity Coalition, Kenya Organic Agriculture Network, Institute for Culture and Ecology and Kenya Small Scale Farmers&#39; Forum. Green Peace Africa Executive Director Njeri Kabeberi (above) said it was time farmers embraced ecological farming.
