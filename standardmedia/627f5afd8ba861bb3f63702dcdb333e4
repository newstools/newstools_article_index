Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery has vowed to sue his predecessor Joseph ole Lenku for allegedly inciting Kajiado residents against him. Lenku, who has declared he will face Governor David Nkedianye in next year&#39;s gubernatorial election on a Jubilee ticket, had accused the CS of supporting his rivals. &quot;I will not allow this man Lenku to continue tarnishing my name anywhere he goes,&quot; Nkaissery told journalists outside ACK Church in Kajiado town yesterday. The CS said he was not fighting for any seat in Kajiado County and wondered why Ole Lenku was dragging his name into politics. Speaking during a fund-raiser for bright students at Ngatateik, Ole Lenku accused Nkaissery of attempting to frustrate his gubernatorial ambitions. &quot;I&#39;m not in the race to please anyone but to serve our people, who have been neglected by the current government. I urge the CS to concentrate on his job and stop engaging in politics,&quot; said Lenku.
