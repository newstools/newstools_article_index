Taxpayers would have to part with Sh1 billion for mini-elections if rebel Opposition MPs are to lose their seats. Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has kick-started the process of expelling more than 10 members of the National Assembly and two governors who have associated themselves with the new Jubilee Party. A protracted legal battle is expected between the rebels and the party but in the event it leads to by-elections prior to the August 8, 2017 General Election, taxpayers would have to shoulder the burden. Thursday, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) assured the Orange party that it was ready to conduct the mini-polls if the seats were declared vacant. The commission said once the seats are declared vacant, they will draw a budget for the exercise and present it to National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich to release the funds.

We will draw a budget and present it to National Treasury to give us funds. We have the capacity at any time to conduct the by-elections,&quot; said Mr Limo. According to the commission, it costs Sh200 million to conduct a by-election in a county, Sh50 million in a constituency and Sh18 million in a county assembly ward. This means that should the seats be declared vacant for the two governors, the ten National Assembly seats and the various wards, the taxpayer will spend at least Sh1 billion.
