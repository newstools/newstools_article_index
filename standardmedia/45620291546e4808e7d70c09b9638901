MURANG&rsquo;A: A section of MCAs in Murang&#39;a have regretted having taken part in the failed impeachment of local governor Mwangi wa Iria an year ago saying they have now realized his potential in fast tracking development programmes. Five MCAs said it was regrettable that they took part in the process which the Senate rejected rejected for not meeting the constitutional threshold. Speaking at Kahuro market in the governor&#39;s home area, the MCAs led by Anderson Muchemi (Kangari) said they have understood that the projects initiated by wa Iria have transformed the region socially and economically. Other MCAs, Peter Kihungi (Kanyenya ini), Charles Karina (Murang&#39;a town), Samson Kago (Mugoiri), David Kabaka (Kambiti) and Peter Mweri (Rwathia) called on residents in Murang&#39;a to support wa Iria in his re-election campaigns owing to development projects under his leadership. In the failed impeachment motion by nominated Ms Mary Waithera, 34 MCAs were against while 15 supported wa Iria. After a cold war, the MCAs returned to the governor&#39;s fold after he was saved by the Senate over fears that he could be grooming their opponents ahead of the 2017 polls.
