Two people were burnt to death after the house they were sleeping in was razed down in a mysterious night inferno in Kavangua village, Embu East. Their bodies, which were burnt beyond recognition, were discovered the following morning after residents woke up to find the mud-walled house reduced to a pile of ash and debris. One of the bodies is believed to be that of the owner of the house Dennis Murimi, 36, a casual worker at a timber yard, while the other is yet to be identified. According to residents, no one was sure of the identity of the person that Murimi was with the previous night.Area police boss Njoroge Mbugua said Murimi&#39;s father David Nyaga who stays in Ngeniari was going to water his crops at around 6am when he noticed that his son&#39;s one-bed room house was not visible from a distance like before. On moving closer he found the house had been razed to the ground while the bodies that were smouldering couldn&#39;t be recognised. Mbugua said the cause of the fire had not been established but investigations had been commenced. Police removed the bodies to a nearby mortuary.
