The High Court has declined to stop the prosecution of four former senior employees of Britam Limited over allegations of stealing over Sh1 billion from the firm. &nbsp;Justice George Odunga ruled that he cannot stop police from investigating and charging the company&#39;s former managing director Edwin Dande, Elizabeth Nkukuu, Siv Arora and Patricia Wanjama since that will amount to interfering with the work of other institutions. He, however, stopped the police from taking them to court until the DPP reviews the files and approves the charges.
