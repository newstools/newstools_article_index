NAIROBI: The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Disciplinary Committee has summoned 13 defecting governors and legislators to appear in person before it on Friday next week. A statement from ODM&rsquo;s Disciplinary Committee chairman Fred Athuok said the affected &lsquo;defectors&rsquo; should appear for hearing of their cases at 8am on October 7, 2016. The summon letters were sent to two lawyers, Kioko Kilukumi and Danson Mungatana who area acting for the 13. On Wednesday, Kilukumi wrote to the party&#39;s secretary general on behalf of the 10 MPs, two governors and one deputy governor, challenging suggestions that they have defected from ODM. In the letter, Kilukumi said the party must first exhaust its internal dispute resolution mechanism before sending the names to the Registrar of Political Parties. The 13 are fighting to ensure that their names are not sent to the Registrar of Political parties for de-registration, a move that will send them back to the ballot box just 10 months before elections.
