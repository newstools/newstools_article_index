Nominated Members of the County Assembly are now angling for elective positions as they fight to remain in politics after next year&#39;s general election. Multiple interviews with the nominated ward reps showed that they were keen on running for their current positions, with others eyeing senatorial and parliamentary seats. Nominations are done through political parties - mostly to represent special interests such as youths or persons with disability. It is, however, an uphill task to be nominated for more than one term, prompting those picked in the current assembly to go for elective positions. Currently, there are 774 nominated MCAs nationally so that political parties can fulfill the requirements of the two-thirds gender rule. Parties nominated members according to their performance in the 2013 elections, with Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) getting the lion&#39;s share.
