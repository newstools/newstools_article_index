Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has been given two months to produce missing separatist leader Omar Mwamnwadzi in court or forfeit a Sh1 million bond he deposited to have the accused released from remand. Mombasa Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti gave the order yesterday after Sonko, who had been summoned to show cause why his bond should not be forfeited, asked for more time to locate Mwamnwadzi, the founder chairman of the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC). &quot;What I know is that Mwamnwadzi has been attending court for the last two years apart from some days when I was told he was sick,&quot; said the Nairobi senator. Sonko, who was represented by lawyer Jared Magolo, told the court that he stood surety for MRC members for their release after they signed an agreement to keep peace in the run up to the 2013 General Election. The senator was responding to an application by Principle Prosecutor Alex Jamii, who wanted him to explain the whereabouts of Mwamnwadzi to the court. &quot;It is true that I stood surety for Mwamnwadzi and others when no one came to their rescue as they were languishing in jail after being charged with many cases,&quot; said Sonko. Mwamnwazi, his former wife, son and 35 others&nbsp; are facing several cases related to violence in Kwale and Mombasa counties.
