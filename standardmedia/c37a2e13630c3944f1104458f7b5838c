A primary school in Subukia is in the spotlight following the death of a Standard Eight pupil after he was allegedly beaten up by a teacher. The teacher from Subukia Primary School is said to have descended on 14-year-old David Ndung&#39;u with kicks and blows on October 3, after the boy performed dismally in Social Studies. In a seeming case of corporal punishment, which the national government banned years ago, the teacher also accused Ndung&#39;u of pulling the entire class backwards. Elizabeth Nyokabi, the victim&#39;s mother, told The Standard her son had complained of a severe headache the day he was beaten. &quot;My son said he was feeling sick when he came back home that day. He later told me a teacher had beaten him severely for failing to score the minimum marks he had set for the class. He said the teacher caned him everywhere, including on the head,&quot; said Ms Nyokabi. &quot;He said he was considering not doing the KCPE exams because the teacher had given up on him and he was also tired of the beatings.&quot; READ MORE TSC directors to be liable for high fees, Matiang&rsquo;i says Knut remains tight-lipped on pay talks with employer Knec raises bar for exam invigilators gave painkillers Nyokabi said she gave her son painkillers but the headache did not go away. &quot;I took him to Subukia Hospital where he was treated and discharged,&quot; she said, but Ndung&#39;u&#39;s condition worsened last Friday. She took him back to the hospital and was referred to one in Nyahururu where he was admitted. &quot;By the time he was being admitted, my son was very weak. He could not walk on his own and I had to support him,&quot; said the distraught mother. Around 9pm on Saturday, she received a call from a doctor telling her that Ndung&#39;u had died.
