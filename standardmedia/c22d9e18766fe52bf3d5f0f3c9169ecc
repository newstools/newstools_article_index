Construction of the Sh8.2 billion Outer Ring Road in Nairobi will not be completed on schedule. The 12-kilometre stretch between Thika Road and Taj Mall in Embakasi expected to be ready in September next year will be delayed by two and a half months. Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) chairman Daniel Njora said yesterday the project had been delayed by the relocation of water pipes, sewers and power lines. &quot;We initially moved slowly because we had to relocate the services. The relocation is at 90 per cent and we are now moving smoothly,&quot; Mr Njora said. &quot;We are progressing at four per cent per month compared to one per cent when we began,&quot; Njora said, adding that they had already used Sh7.3 billion on the project. &quot;Currently, motorists take between two and three hours to drive to the Southern Bypass from Thika Road. This will be reduced to 10 minutes once the road is complete.&quot; Major obstacle Njora said compensating land owners was a major obstacle although it had been sorted out. He however said they may need to pay additional money in compensation to land owners as the design of the road had changed. KURA&nbsp;Director General Silas Kinoti said completion of the road from the General Service Unit to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport would boost the economy besides easing traffic in Nairobi&#39;s central business district. &quot;This is the first major government project aimed at de-congesting Nairobi and we are happy with its progress,&quot; said Mr Kinoti. &quot;The project will significantly cut down on the cost of travelling. Public service vehicles will use specific lanes to ensure free flowing traffic while pedestrians will have footpaths and bridges.&quot; GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
