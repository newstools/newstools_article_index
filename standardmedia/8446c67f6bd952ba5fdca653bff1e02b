KERICHO: A form four student from Koelel Secondary School has moved to court to file an application seeking court orders directing the school to allow him back after he was expelled on June 18, 2016. The 16 year old filed the application through his father in a petition presented before Lady Justice Janet Mulwa. The application indicated that he sought orders from the court to have him readmitted so as to allow him time prepare and sit for his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education set to begin on November 7, 2016. A supporting affidavit accompanying the application indicated that the minor was dismissed from school verbally by Board of Management who accused him of defying a teacher and a school prefect. His father&#39;s attempt to have him in school has failed since then.

Their appearance before the board did not bear any fruits as the school has never communicated to them on the fate of their child and decided to move to court in pursuit of justice. He believed that his son&#39;s rights had been trampled on deliberately as he claimed the process used to determine his expulsion were not justifiable. The court however failed to issue orders and directed that they serve the respondents with the application pending an inter-party hearing on October 11, 2016. The matter was certified urgent.
