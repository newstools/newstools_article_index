Sugarcane farmers in Chemase, Nandi County have decried exploitation by private millers who they accuse of offering low prices for their produce. The cane farmers said the private millers were paying them Sh2,500 per tonne against the market price of Sh3,500. The farmers staged a demonstration at one of the private milling companies on Monday in an attempt to meet the managers, but were turned away by security guards who told them there was no one to address them. Chemase Sugarcane Farmers Union Chairman Thomas Choge expressed disappointment with the national government, saying it was doing nothing to safeguard the farmers from exploitation by the millers. &ldquo;Why should the miller buy our produce at a lower price than other companies? Why does the Government watch as we are exploited?&rdquo; Mr Choge posed.

We were hoping that our predicament would be addressed by the management as we had been promised, only to realise that we were tricked,&rdquo; said Choge. The farmers called on the Government to intervene and shield them from exploitation by regulating the price of the cane. &ldquo;The national and county governments should play their role of protecting farmers from exploitation by millers. The market price should apply in all factories,&rdquo; said Choge. Kenya Union of Sugar Plantation and Allied Workers Union (KUSPAWU) National Vice Chairman Michael Ochieng said his office would follow up the matter with relevant Government authorities.
