An 85-year-old granny is fighting for her life at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu after she was gang raped, battered and left for dead. The granny was yesterday scheduled to undergo an operation. The hospital&#39;s Chief Administrator Juliana Otieno said she is out of danger, adding that they are waiting for an examination report from the theatre to inform their next move. Rose Akoth, her daughter-in-law, reported that a group of three men drilled a hole on the wall of the two-roomed house where she slept alone and raped her on Wednesday night in her Nyahera home.
