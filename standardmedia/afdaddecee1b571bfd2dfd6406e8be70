Kenya Airways and Kenya Rugby Union have confirmed that they have a contractual agreement regarding participation of the national &ldquo;Kenya 7s&rdquo; rugby team in the Safari Sevens tournament. KQ&rsquo;s marketing director Chris Diaz and Kenya Rugby Union&rsquo;s Richard Omwela said contrary to the impression created by a forensic investigation report into&nbsp;KQ&rsquo;s role in the tournament, the airline need not have any other contract other the one they have with KRU. They also clarified that&nbsp;KQ&nbsp;did not pay any monies to the organisers of the tournament as implied by the initial report on the matter carried in The Standard on Saturday last week.&nbsp;KQ&nbsp;spent Sh1.6 million in the last two years in promoting the national team at the Sevens tournament. Deloitte Consulting Limited conducted the forensic investigations into&nbsp;KQ&rsquo;s role in the tourney. &ldquo;As the national team sponsor and airline partner, Kenya Airways does not pay any cash sponsorship to the Union to take part in the tournament. In instances where it decides to activate the sponsorship locally for engagement, the airline takes up a promotional booth where it hosts its guests and caters for them at their expense,&rdquo; Omwela said. In responses to The Standard on Saturday, Diaz pointed out that&nbsp;KQ&rsquo;s spending on the tournament was modest and only limited to its sponsorship of the national team. He said since&nbsp;KQtook up the national team, rugby had grown exponentially.

The forensics report also acknowledged that&nbsp;KQ&nbsp;&ldquo;was obligated to participate in the Safari Sevens event, failure of which would be considered as a breach of contract.&rdquo; It said from the analysis presented to it,&nbsp;KQ&rsquo;s participation in the sevens was beneficial.
