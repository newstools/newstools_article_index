Security agencies in Kibwezi Thursday ordered the closure of a church run by a self-proclaimed ghost-buster over alleged sex orgies. Machinery Assistant County Commissioner Vitalis Ogur, who was accompanied by local police officers, ordered the closure of the ghost-buster premise. Addressing residents at Masongaleni market where the said church operates from, Mr Ogur said he had received complaints that some church orderlies were involved in orgies involving school-going girls. &ldquo;We have agreed that the church will remain closed until we investigate the allegations levelled against the pastor and the church officials. We will get to the bottom of the matter,&rdquo; he said.

They are falsehoods peddled by traders who lead wayward lifestyles at the market and who have been unable to stomach our style of preaching and exorcising demons,&rdquo; he said. According to the pastor, his style of evangelism, which entails busting demons, had earned him enemies among fellow pastors and traders at the market. &ldquo;They have fought me since I first set base at the market one year ago,&rdquo; said the pastor who was accompanied by his sister and two worshippers.
