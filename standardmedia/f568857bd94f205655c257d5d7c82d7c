Director of Public Prosecution has upheld the recommendation of the anti-graft agency to charge an MP for allegedly submitting forged academic certificates during the last general elections. Kapsaret MP Oscar Sudi is cited in the latest Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission (EACC) report for allegedly presenting a forged Diploma in Business Management and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). According to the report that was tabled in Parliament by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, the MP is accused of further making a false declaration under oath through a self-declaration form to the IEBC. &quot;The suspect also uttered the said forged documents to the IEBC and EACC, with the intention to deceive these commissions,&quot; reads the report in part. The second quarterly report covering the period from April 1st to June 30, 2016 states that the commission compiled a report and forwarded it to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) recommending that the MP be charged with three accounts of forgery. &quot;The DPP on July 31, accepted the recommendation for the prosecution of the MP on the three counts of forgery that include uttering of false documents, providing false information and making a false statutory regulation,&rdquo; adds the report.
