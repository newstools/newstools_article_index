Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has told UDF MPs who decamped to Jubilee Party to &#39;return home&#39; before it is too late. Mudavadi has given the MPs nine days to denounce Jubilee. &quot;They still have nine days to declare their stand. They should leave the neighbour&#39;s home immediately and come back before it is late,&quot; said Mudavadi. Mudavadi, who also vied for the presidency on UDF ticket in 2013 said ANC will not associate with Jubilee for whatever reason. Our target is to defeat Jubilee in 2017 and those who crossed over should return,&quot; said Mudavadi who spoke in Mumias East Constituency, Kakamega County. At the same time, Mudavadi urged local MPs, including Mumias East&#39;s Benjamin Washiali to join ANC. Those who defected to Jubilee included Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), David Were (Matungu) and Malulu Injendi (Malava).
