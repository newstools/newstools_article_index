Police officers will soon enjoy better terms of service, including pay, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has revealed. He said, a new scheme of service, that will be launched soon will ensure that the officers&#39; pay is commensurate with that of those serving in the civil service. &quot;It (new scheme of service) is coming soon and the officers will be informed when it is ready. It will ensure better pay and placement of officers,&quot; he said. The scheme of service will have 14 police grades and will be aligned to that of the mainstream civil service. &quot;This means police officers will forthwith enjoy salaries and allowances commensurate with their colleagues&#39;, who are serving in the civil service,&quot; said Boinnet while addressing officers at the General Service Unit headquarters in Nairobi during a sensitisation campaign on police transformation. The scheme has already been validated by key stakeholders in the security sector and police officers of various ranks and now awaits a board decision and printing before its formal launch.
