An electrician who was allegedly lured to a crime scene will serve two years in jail for breaking in. Boniface Mwangi had appealed against a seven-year jail sentence by a magistrate&rsquo;s court for being caught with a pair of pliers, a hammer and three screwdrivers after the break-in. In his appeal before High Court judge Said Chitembwe, Mr Mwangi said that on October 8, 2014, he was called by a friend to fix an electric fault in a store. However, the friend deserted him and he was found at the scene by the owner of the store, which had been broken into earlier. Mwangi said he thought it was genuine job so he did not run away even after the store owner, Omar Said, approached him. Mr Said told the court that he lived in a separate place from the store. He said at 7pm on October 7, 2014, he received a call that two men had attempted to break into his store.

According to Said, he found the two and managed to arrest Mwangi while the other man fled. The judge noted that during trial in the magistrate&rsquo;s court, Mwangi opted to remain silent when he was asked to defend himself against the allegations concerning him. Justice Chitembwe found Mwangi&rsquo;s narrative wanting, noting that his unnamed friend did not have the key to the store. The judge added that the prosecution had proved its case on felony but noted that since nothing was stolen, seven years in jail was excessive. Mwangi was charged under Section 308(2) of the Penal Code, which states that any person caught on someone else&rsquo;s premises with items connected to burglary is liable for a felony.
