Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has ruled out joining the Jubilee Party after his United Republican Party (URP) folds up this week. Instead, Ruto vowed to popularise his new political outfit, Chama cha Mashinani (CCM), across the country. The governor said CCM party has already opened 37 offices countrywide. &quot;We are planning to open offices in the remaining regions because we want to ensure that we field candidates from the County Assemblies to the national seats in 2017,&quot; Ruto said in Eldoret. The search for the party&#39;s name caused delays in registration. The party&#39;s initial name-Mashinani Development Party (MDP)- was dropped after officials found out that there was another party with a similar acronym.
