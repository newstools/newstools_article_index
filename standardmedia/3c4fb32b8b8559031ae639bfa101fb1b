Amani National Coalition&nbsp;leader&nbsp;Musalia&nbsp;Mudavadi&nbsp;has&nbsp;criticised Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and his Elgeyo/Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos for leading demonstrations against the appointment of a new Vice Chancellor at Moi University.&nbsp;Mudavadi&nbsp;described the governors&rsquo; action as discriminatory. &ldquo;All Kenyans have the constitutional right to work anywhere,&rdquo; he said. But&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;from the North Rift dismissed claims that they are fanning tribalism. Led by Mandago, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and his Nandi Hills counterpart Alfred Keter, they told&nbsp;off&nbsp;Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery and National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) chairman Francis ole Kaparo for demanding an apology from them. Nkaissery asked the NCIC to demand an public apology from the&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;who attempted to stop newly-appointed acting Vice Chancellor Prof Laban Ayiro from taking office. Nkaissery said if they fail to do so they will be prosecuted. But Sudi responded:&rdquo;...we will not apologise because we did nothing wrong. We do not fear to be arrested because we are fighting an injustice.&rdquo; However, Elgeyo Marakwet senator Kipchumba Murkomen said Moi University was faced with major problems that touched on leadership and staffing levels.
