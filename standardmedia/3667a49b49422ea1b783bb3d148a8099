Homa Bay: An angry mob lynched a 33-year-old man who allegedly killed his wife over domestic differences. Police said Erick Otieno was killed on Tuesday evening at Adiedo trading centre in Rachuonyo North sub-county for allegedly strangling his wife, Irene Anyango, 23. Otieno is said to have arrived at his Adiedo Kasaka Village home in West Kanyaluo at 1am before ordering his wife to get out of the house. The man is said to have taken his wife to a nearby bush where he strangled her to death. Otieno is said to have then tied the body of the woman to a motorbike and taken it to a hotel compound where he dumped it. Area chief Elias Ombim said preliminary investigations fingered Otieno as the killer of his wife--a mother of two children.
