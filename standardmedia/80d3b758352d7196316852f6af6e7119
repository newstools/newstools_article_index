Kisii town residents are up in arms over reports of dead animals being ferried to the main slaughterhouse. The reaction comes after residents reported three incidents where a known man was found delivering dead cows to the town&#39;s biggest abattoir. The dead animals were said to have been delivered to the slaughterhouse on Sunday evening. The foul smell from the abattoir got the residents alarmed. It was the second incident in a span of one month and questions were being asked as to who could be involved in the scam. On Monday morning, the residents stormed the facility and demanded answers from the officers in charge of the slaughterhouse. County Public Health Officer Mellitus Kabar said the abattoir officers had tampered with crucial evidence after they dumped the carcass in the waste disposal area of the facility. It also emerged that the officers had on Sunday evening tried to bury the carcass. &quot;The animal was brought into the slaughterhouse using a private car (Probox Toyota) by a well-known person. We reported the matter to the police but we are being informed that he was immediately released,&quot; said Peter Omweri, an Mpesa operator. He said the smell from the already decayed animal attracted a number of onlookers who threatened to beat up the owner before he was rescued by the county enforcement officers. The suspect is said to have been released on cash bail from the cells but the acting county police commander, Francis Nguli, said he was not aware of the incident. Sources said the suspect, a brother to a senior county assembly staff, was released from the cells after it emerged that nobody was willing to record statement on the matter for fear of victimization. Visiting the facility, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi promised to order investigation on the matter and report back in a week&#39;s time. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
