A man who killed his younger brother in a fit of rage in Rachuonyo South sub-county was lynched by the public. Police said William Omiti, 40, was lynched by the mob in Oyugis town as he fled after killing his brother, Japheth Ochieng&rsquo;, 37, on Saturday evening. Witnesses said trouble started on Friday night when Mr Omiti returned to his Oyengwe village home while drunk. His wife, having not been home as she had fled months ago after disagreement, said he attacked his first-born daughter with the intention of killing her using a knife and panga. However, Mr Ochieng&rsquo;, who is his second follower in the family intervened to save the life of the four-year-old girl. It is then that Omiti channelled his anger on his brother. Their cousin, Milton Okoth, said Omiti pounced on the brother with a panga and blunt objects, leaving him with serious injuries.
