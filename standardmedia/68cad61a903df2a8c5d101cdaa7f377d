The fake campaign poster doing rounds on Social Media KTN&rsquo;s Managing Editor Joe Ageyo has denied rumours circulating on social media alleging that he is interested in running for a parliamentary seat in Bondo Constituency. He says that those are detractors only interested in maligning his good work. In a statement posted on his social media page he said, &ldquo;Over the last 24 hours, I have received inquiries from far and wide regarding certain malicious posts on social media about myself. If I didn&rsquo;t care so much about the millions of Kenyans who have supported my work as a journalist for the last 18 years, I would not have dignified those posts by a response. &rdquo; He further added that he greatly respects his work and would not want to torture his supporters with endless guesswork about his professional standing. &ldquo;To be clear, I do not come from Bondo Constituency. I have the best job in the world that I do not intend to trade for any other. The only election-related plan I have is to ensure that KTN News, the country&rsquo;s only 24-hour news channel, whose founding editor I am, has the best election coverage in the country come next year,&rdquo; he concluded.&nbsp; READ MORE Voters need civic education before August 2017 elections How Nairobi&rsquo;s &lsquo;YouTube Lady&rsquo; used Internet to build fashion design firm Breaking impasse on IEBC good for country
