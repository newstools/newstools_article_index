Journalists in Uasin Gishu took to the streets yesterday morning to protest against increased harassment by police officers. Over 50 journalists from various media houses, accompanied by rights activists, marched to the Eldoret West Police Station carrying placards to seek audience with County Police Commander Joseph Nyaga. They cited an incident on Tuesday where a police officer harassed a journalist during a protest march by Eldoret residents. They also raised concern over threats to some of them by some politicians in the region, which they said, amounted to intimidation. The police on Tuesday lobbed teargas canisters to disperse hundreds of demonstrators in Eldoret town who accused the State of targeting their leaders over the Moi University leadership row. A K24 cameraman Duncan Wanga was allegedly assaulted and his camera damaged by the area Deputy Officer Commanding Station (OCS) Pius Misikhu as he covered the protest.
