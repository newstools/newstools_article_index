Senate majority leader Kithure Kindiki has insisted he will table a motion of impeachment against Lands Cabinet Secretary&nbsp;Jacob Kaimenyi for failing to resolve Meru-Tharaka Nithi border disputes. Speaking at Ntuntuni Church, the Tharaka Nithi Senator accused Kaimenyi of being arrogant and playing politics with the matter. Kindiki said he had no personal grudge with Kaimenyi since he was part of those who endorsed him to become the successor of former Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu. He said&nbsp;he had high&nbsp;expectations that Kaimenyi would resolve the border stalemate once sworn into office. He said compared to Kaimenyi, it is now evident that Charity Ngilu was more committed to end the border row despite her not being from the region. &ldquo;Earlier when he was being impeached, I stood firm to defend him though other leaders from Meru were silent on the matter, but the person I was defending is now throwing stones at me when I tell him to move with speed and help our community,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Kindiki. He rubbished claims by Kaimenyi that&nbsp;a committee had been formed to resolve the boundary issue in the two counties, saying it was mere politics.
