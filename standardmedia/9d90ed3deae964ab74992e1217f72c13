Some members of the Ngome Council of Elders yesterday distanced themselves from their colleagues who endorsed Senator Lenny Kivuti for the governor&rsquo;s race. About 30 elders said endorsing Kivuti went against an already existing agreement that outlines how elective seats would be shared among the Embu and Mbeere communities. Led by council secretary Ben Kanyenji, the elders said the January 2011 pact gives the Embu community the governor and woman representative positions, while Mbeere gets the senator and deputy governor seats for 10 years. The elders said the MoU still remains and breaking it might spark enmity between the two communities. &ldquo;Since Senator Kivuti comes from the Mbeere community and has defied the MoU, he should now forget either of the two seats,&rdquo; said Kanyeji. On Friday, Ngome elders led by chairman Eston Nyaga and a splinter of Nyangi Ndiiriri, led by Richard Mbogo, endorsed and blessed Kivuti for the governor&rsquo;s seat. Kanyeji accused elders endorsing leaders of being &ldquo;elders for hire&rdquo;.
