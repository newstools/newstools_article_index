ASIA: Iraqi government forces, with air and ground support from the U.S.-led coalition, launched an offensive on Monday to drive Islamic State from the northern city of Mosul, the militants&#39; last major stronghold in the country. Helicopters released flares overhead and explosions could be heard on the city&#39;s eastern front, where Kurdish fighters moved forward to take outlying villages, a Reuters correspondent said. The United States predicted Islamic State would suffer &quot;a lasting defeat&quot; as Iraqi forces mounted their biggest operation since the U.S. withdrew its own troops in 2011. Some 30,000 Iraqi soliders, Kurdish Peshmerga militia and Sunni tribal fighters were expected to take part in the offensive to drive an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 Islamic State militants from Mosul, a city of 1.5 million people. &quot;I announce today the start of the heroic operations to free you from the terror and the oppression of Daesh,&quot; Prime Minister Haider Abadi said in a speech on state TV, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. &quot;We will meet soon on the ground of Mosul to celebrate liberation and your salvation,&quot; he said, surrounded by the armed forces&#39; top commanders.
