Kenyan Premier League Limited&#39;s (KPL) action of pulling down sponsorship banners placed by Mathare United at the Nyayo National Stadium before their match against Posta Rangers raises key issues about the obligation that clubs and organisers of the league have with their sponsors. Mathare feel aggrieved that KPL removed the banners of their sponsors, Betway, without their consent. The premier league is sponsored by a rival betting firm, Sportpesa. The club has now threatened to sue KPL for Sh10 million. This conflict over domain raises many fundamental issues. In a country such as Kenya where most football clubs do not own playing grounds, how can sponsors&#39; banners be displayed? And who has proprietary rights to display banners given that in the Kenyan situation, KPL clubs and this organisation share proprietary rights? These are sticking points that need to be put on the table when KPL holds a council meeting to discuss this stand-off. In the Kenyan arrangement, KPL secured the right to run the league from Football Kenya Federation and solicits for sponsorship to run its operations.

But when clubs solicit their own sponsorship, a way must be found so that they are not disadvantaged. As it is now, clubs may claim to be professional, but they are really not financially independent to the extent that they can pay their operational costs and players&rsquo; salaries without the support of sponsors or other benefactors. The clubs must be allowed to generate their own income to supplement the money they earn from selling match tickets and merchandise &mdash; if they have them. A way, that will be beneficial to both the clubs and KPL, must be found to end the current impasse.
