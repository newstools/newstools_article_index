&nbsp; Kanu wants the Political Parties Tribunal to restrain Jubilee Party from using colours it argues have identified the independence party for decades. Secretary General Nick Salat argued his party has been known for red, green and black since its registration in 1963. Kanu wants Jubilee stopped from using the colours for its new outfit, Jubilee Party, to be launched tomorrow. Salat, in his affidavit, says the move by Jubilee to use the said colours is meant to confuse Kanu supporters. He further claims Jubilee will cause confusion among the voters and the general public if not stopped. &quot;Jubilee&#39;s use of the colours without authority is illegal and in breach of the Political Parties Act,&quot; Salat contends in the suit papers filed at the High Court.
