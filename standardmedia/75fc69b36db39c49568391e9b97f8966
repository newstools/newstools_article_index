NAIROBI, KENYA: Commuters got stranded on Tuesday morning following demonstration by Multimedia University Students over fatal road accident along Langata road on Sunday that left four people dead. The University is located along Magadi road and most of the students use Langata road on their way to Nairobi city center. Early Tuesday, the students blocked Magadi road disrupting traffic flow along that route which is normally busy during weekdays. The matatu in the Sunday accident veered off the road and overturned along Langata Road, Nairobi. Four of the people injured had life-threatening injuries, police said. The matatu was ferrying passengers from Ongata Rongai to the city centre when the accident happened near Langata Police Station at mid-day. On Monday the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) reacted by deregistering a sacco whose matatu was involved in the accident prompting fare hike on Tuesday. The authority advised the public to avoid boarding these vehicles as they shall be impounded if found operating contrary to the Authority&rsquo;s directive.
