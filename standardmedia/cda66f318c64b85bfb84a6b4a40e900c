The High Court has suspended arrest and prosecution of palm-wine drinkers and sellers until a suit on its legality is determined. The legal status of mnazi, which is widely consumed at the Coast, is tenuous owing to conflicting State policy. Whereas it was declared legal by Parliament some years ago, sellers and drinkers are often arrested, sometimes for flouting regulations associated with its consumption. A group that has been documenting alleged harassment of sellers in Kisauni, Mombasa, has gone to the High Court for interpretation of the matter. And yesterday it received interim orders suspending all trials related to mnazi consumption pending the outcome of the main suit. Upendo Palm Wine Self-Help Group filed a suit in the High Court against harassment and arrest by the police.

The Director of Public Prosecutions has been enjoined in the main suit, which will be heard in a fortnight. Stephen Kahindi Baya and Tumaini Masha Wanje, through their lawyer Angelo Owino, applied for a temporary injunction stopping the police from harassing mnazi sellers and their customers in Kisauni sub-county pending inter-parties hearing. The two applied that all pending cases at Shanzu Law Courts touching on possession and selling of mnazi brew be stayed. Justice Njoki Mwangi yesterday issued orders stopping the prosecution of mnazi brew sellers at Shanzu Law Courts until the Director of Public Prosecution is enjoined in the suit. Mwangi said the DPP was best placed to deal with such matters because he is charged with prosecution of cases. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
