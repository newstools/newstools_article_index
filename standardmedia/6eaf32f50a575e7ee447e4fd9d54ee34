A statement by a candidate for the position of Chief Justice, Makau Mutua, came back to haunt him in his quest for the job. Prof Mutua however maintained that he would not retract the comment even if he becomes the CJ since he made it as a private citizen exercising his freedom of speech. He said his opinions would not interfere with his relationship with the President. When the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the Supreme Court declared Uhuru Kenyatta the validly elected president in 2014, Mutua tweeted, &quot;As a matter of my freedom of conscience and thought, I can&#39;t accept Uhuru Kenyatta as President of Kenya. I can&#39;t and won&#39;t.&quot; Answering questions from the Judicial Service Commission interview panel, Mutua said: &quot;Citizens have a right to their opinions; there is a distinction between private citizen Makau Mutua who has a right to dissent with any decision and Prof Mutua seeking to be the CJ.&quot; Mutua was taken to task for failing to get Kenya Revenue Authority clearance and a certificate of good conduct. He was also asked why he took so long to repay his university loan. Githu Muigai:&nbsp;&quot;You have been quoted saying you don&#39;t agree with the Supreme Court decision on the presidential election petition and that you don&#39;t recognise President Kenyatta. Do you still hold that stand?&quot; READ MORE Ban on Kenyan miraa ill-advised President Uhuru, Opposition leader Raila political rivalry plays out during Ntimama's burial IGAD holds 28th summit in Somali capital Mutua:&nbsp;&quot;I said I disagreed with the court&#39;s decision but respect it. If I was a judge in that court, maybe I would have dissented. I have children and when we go on holiday, some of them dissent but I do not excommunicate them because of their opinions.&quot; Tom Ojienda: &quot;If you become the CJ, the law requires that you are sworn in by the President, but you say your views have not changed. How then will you take the oath of office? And why do you refer to him as Mr Kenyatta and not President Kenyatta?&quot; Mutua: &quot;My views will not change if I am nominated. Uhuru Kenyatta was declared President, I can&#39;t dispute that. I refer to him as Mr Kenyatta same as you can refer to me as Mr Mutua. It is just a choice.&quot; Ojienda: &quot;Do you belong to any religion?&quot; Mutua: &quot;I do not belong to any organised religion. I am neither an atheist nor a heathen but I find many values in religious teachings to be admirable.&quot; Winnie Guchu: &quot;Don&#39;t you think the perception that you don&#39;t recognise the President will be a recipe for chaos? And how will you work together as head of the Judiciary?&quot; GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
