The invitation Deputy President&nbsp;William Ruto extended to Wiper&nbsp;leader Kalonzo Musyoka to abandon&nbsp;Opposition coalition for Jubilee Party&nbsp;has stepped up pre-election rivalry. After wooing his Wiper MPs from&nbsp;Ukambani to join Jubilee Party, the&nbsp;political posturing by the DP directed&nbsp;at Kalonzo has the effect of stoking&nbsp;suspicions in CORD where Kalonzo,&nbsp;Raila Odinga (ODM) and Moses&nbsp;Wetang&rsquo;ula (Ford-K) are battling forcoalition&#39;s presidential ticket. The invitation comes days after Kalonzo&#39;s declaration at a rally in Mombasa that he is fed up with being in Opposition and that he would explore options to ensure he is in the next Government. Kalonzo&#39;s allies declared Jubilee wasn&#39;t among their options as Raila declared the CORD flag-bearer will be the one elected by members of the party. &quot;Why does the DP think that Kalonzo is interested in joining JP?&quot; asked Kitui Senator David Musila who is also Wiper Party chairman. He added: &quot;I want to make it clear that Kalonzo and Wiper have never at any time considered joining Jubilee. For this to happen, the DP will have to wait for a long time.&quot; Kalonzo and Wetang&#39;ula have told Raila to step down from the race and become the kingmaker by endorsing one of them to be the flag-bearer, a suggestion the ODM leader ruled out yesterday.

It is a prospect Uhuru and Ruto are working hard to forestall by raiding Opposition zones to secure a first-round victory. &quot;We are selling the Jubilee &#39;gospel&#39; across the country. Why would anyone want to stay in Opposition? We are opening up to work with everybody irrespective of which side of the political divide they are in,&quot; explained nominated MP Johnston Sakaja.
