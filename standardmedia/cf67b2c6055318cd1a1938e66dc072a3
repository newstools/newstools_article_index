ELDORET: A team of Kenya Forest Service (KFS) rangers on mission to flush out encroachers from the Embobut forest in Egeyo Marakwet County were Friday morning injured after being shot with arrows. The two rangers were part of a five-member team that were shot with arrows by locals from Terich village in a morning incident as they attempted to arrest locals putting up in the forest. By mid-morning the officers were still held hostage by the agitated locals armed with bows and arrows inside the forest. KFS rangers in Elgeyo Marakwet are appealing for a chopper to assist in the evacuation of two critically injured officers from Embobut forest. According to KFS enforcement officer Stephen Chesa, one of the ranger has been shot on the chest and is in critical condition with the other sustaining a minor injury. He said the officers had arrested four suspects but were confronted by locals who resisted the move&nbsp;injuring the two.
