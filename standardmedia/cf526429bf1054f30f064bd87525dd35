An estimated 70,000 people are facing starvation in Laikipia North following failed rains. And learning may soon be disrupted as residents migrate in search of water and pasture for their livestock. This could lead to the closing of primary and secondary schools in the constituency as parents move with their children. According to nominated MP Sarah Lekorere who comes from the region, the drought has hit hard for the last three months. &ldquo;We have not received rain for the last few months and now the residents are facing starvation. The animals have started dying as there is not enough pasture and water,&rdquo; she said. She said more than 2,000 animals had been reported dead in the region.
