The Kisumu Diaspora Community has denied having links with any aspirants seeking to unseat Governor Jack Ranguma. The group&rsquo;s Secretary and spokesman, Audi Ogada said they had wrongly been associated with Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga who has declared her interests in the Kisumu governorship. The group, locally known as &ldquo;Oluowo Reru&rdquo; (people who followed the railway line to reach Kisumu) and which comprises traders, politicians and activists from other counties had accused the governor of favouring his Kano clans when giving jobs and tenders, a claim the governor denied.&nbsp;
