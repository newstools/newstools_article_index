KAKAMEGA: Prominent leaders from Western Kenya yesterday endorsed ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi to vie for the presidency and said only he could offer a credible challenge to&nbsp; President Uhuru Kenyatta in next year&rsquo;s elections. The leaders who were speaking during&nbsp; a fund-raiser at Khwisero Girls Secondary School in Kakamega County convened by Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) Secretary General Francis Atwoli said even though other leaders from the region had declared their interest to run, these leaders need&nbsp; to step down and back Mudavadi&nbsp; who also ran for the presidency in 2013. The leaders were referring to&nbsp; CORD co-principal Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula and former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo who have stated that they will seek nomination to vie for the presidency. Wetang&rsquo;ula launched his presidential campaign for the CORD ticket early this year at Muliro Gradens in Kakamega, while&nbsp; Jirongo is yet to launch his bid but insists he wants to vie. Mudavadi who addressed yesterday&rsquo;s meeting skipped by Wetang&rsquo;ula and Jirongo&nbsp; asked voters in Western region to support his bid.&nbsp; The former Deputy Prime Minister, however,&nbsp; noted that&nbsp; his mission was to dislodge Jubilee from power and not to fight CORD, whose leaders have recently admitted to be in talks with Mudavadi to pursue a joint camaign. &ldquo;I am still in the race. I need your support as a community to realise that dream. I am not fighting CORD but seeking to remove Jubilee from power. I want this to be clear,&rdquo; the ANC leader stated unequivocally. And yesterday, Kakamega Governor and ODM Deputy Party Leader Wycliffe Oparanya, a Raila Odinga stalwart,&nbsp; threw his weight behind Mudavadi.

He is a gentleman and the only presidential candidate from western that I support. The rest will have to wait,&rdquo; said the governor who has been ODM&rsquo;s point man in the region. Oparanya admitted that he had been holding talks with Mudavadi. &ldquo;We even met two days ago,&rdquo; said Oparanya. Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba, who was present, said leaders from the region should forge a common front. &ldquo;Atwoli is leading talks to bring the community and its leaders together. We are not talking about just unity but unity of purpose&rdquo; Namwamba&nbsp; added. However, Atwoli yesterday&nbsp; steered clear of the Mudavadi candidacy issue and said he would convene a meeting in December during which time the region&rsquo;s political direction would be determined. Atwoli said students from University of Nairobi have been commissioned to conduct a survey that will determine who among the area&rsquo;s leaders will have the greatest appeal to voters GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
