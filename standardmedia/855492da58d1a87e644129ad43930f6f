Earlier in the day, two students were charged in court for&nbsp;attempted arson of the university&#39;s Science laboratory contrary to section 333 (a) of the penal code. The students had spent a night at the Kisii Police Station cells and were arraigned&nbsp;before Chief&nbsp;Magistrate Jesse Nyaga. They were released on a bond of Sh50,000 and one similar surety or a cash bail of Sh20,000 each.

The students were represented in court by lawyer Edward Obegi who said that the accused were students and could religiously attend court if released on free bond. &quot;Some of these students have just joined University a few months ago and they would wish to continue with their education. Am sure if they are released on free bond they will still come back to court for this matter,&quot; said Begi. On Monday, the students took to the streets and burnt down the fee collection office at the main campus to protest a new rule on fee payment. They accused the university management of refusing to listen to their grievances and demanded that the university withdraws the deadline set for clearance of fee balances. The students lit bonfires along the Kisii-Kilgoris road as a combined team of Administration and Kenya Police officers engaged them in running battles. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
