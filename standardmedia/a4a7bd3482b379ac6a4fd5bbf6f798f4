ZURICH:&nbsp;An air traffic controller gave a Swiss air force fighter pilot too low an altitude at which to fly moments before his jet slammed into a cloud-draped mountain last month, killing him, the defence ministry said on Tuesday. Preliminary results of an investigation found the 27-year-old pilot was told to fly at 10,000 feet (3,050 metres) after losing radar contact with his team leader soon after takeoff. His F/A 18 fighter hit the mountain at around 3,300 metres. The minimum safe altitude for flying in the sector was 14,300 feet, the ministry said. &quot;Why the air traffic controller ordered this too-low altitude and which influence this had on the further course of the flight is subject of the investigation,&quot; it said. The crash was the third by a Swiss Air Force F/A 18 in the past three years. A Swiss F-5E air demonstration fighter jet collided with another plane and crashed into a pond in the northern Netherlands ahead of an air show in June.&nbsp; READ MORE Emirates jet hit by shifting winds before hard landing, fire - inquiry
