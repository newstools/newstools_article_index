Women have condemned the continued harassment by loan sharks in the county. The women staged a protest at Karatina Stadium on Sunday, claiming the loan sharks were colluding with police officers to arrest borrowers who were unable to repay their loans and, in some cases, seizing their property without court orders. The protest was in reaction to an&nbsp;expos&eacute; by The Standard on Sunday on how loan sharks were harassing desperate women in villages in Mathira.

Mary Githuku, the chairperson of Asesdo, a Karatina group, complained that many women in Karatina had been tormented by loan sharks to the point of fleeing their homes. &ldquo;A woman in Kiaruhiu village whose husband had a stroke ran away from her home because of constant attacks by the loan sharks. Nobody knows where she went and her husband is now helpless,&rdquo; said Ms Githuku. The women called on county leaders to intervene and save their homes.

Marriages are breaking up every day. They need to step in,&rdquo; appealed Githuku. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
