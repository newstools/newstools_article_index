Migori, Kenya: Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula has maintained that he is best suited as CORD presidential candidate. The Bungoma senator said this when he took his campaign to Migori over the weekend. Mr Wetang&#39;ula, who visited Kuria and Suna East constituencies, asked CORD leader Raila Odinga to pay back by backing him in next year&#39;s elections. He said CORD was better placed to replace Jubilee in the coming elections. He asked Raila to back someone else since he had tried three times and failed. &quot;I have asked Raila to return the favour,&quot; he said.
