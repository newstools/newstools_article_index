Director of Criminal Investigations Ndegwa Muhoro has defended his decision to transfer an officer to Loyangalani in Marsabit. Samuel Barongo, who had been the Officer in Charge of the Flying Squad Unit in Nakuru County, had claimed his transfer was prompted by a Sh70 million highway robbery racket. Three police officers are facing charges of robbery with violence. In a letter of transfer dated July 16, 2015 and signed by Jacinta Kinyua, the officer was ordered to leave Nakuru for Loyangalani to serve as deputy director of criminal investigations. The officer, however, declined and moved to court and filed a suit to stop his transfer. In response, Mr Muhoro indicated in discharging his duties as the director, he is lawfully empowered to transfer police officers.

It was alleged he would detain vehicles without entering their details in records, only to release them later after receiving bribes.
