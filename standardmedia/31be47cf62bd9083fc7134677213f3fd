&nbsp; Europe Hungarians are expected to reject the European Union&#39;s migrant quotas in a referendum on Sunday but turnout will likely be too low to make the vote valid, disappointing Prime Minister Viktor Orban. By 1300 GMT only 30.66 percent of voters had cast their ballots which analysts said indicated turnout will not top the 50 percent required for the poll to be valid. While Orban and his rightwing Fidesz party are still likely to herald the vote as a victory at home, an invalid referendum would curb Orban&#39;s ability to exert pressure on Brussels to change its migration policies. &quot;I think if turnout is around 40 percent, that is a fiasco for Viktor Orban and the government in international terms,&quot; said Attila Juhasz, an analyst at thinktank Political Capital. Juhasz said they estimated turnout to be 44 to 46 percent based on currently available data. Orban, in power since 2010, is among the toughest opponents of immigration in the EU, and over the past year has sealed Hungary&#39;s southern borders with a razor-wire fence and thousands of army and police border patrols. After casting his vote in a wealthy Budapest district early on Sunday, Orban told reporters that he would go to Brussels next week to start talks, empowered by the referendum result. &quot;And I shall try, with the help of the outcome, if this is an appropriate outcome, to ensure that we should not be forced to accept in Hungary people we don&#39;t want to live with.&quot; He said what mattered was that votes rejecting the quotas should exceed the number of &quot;Yes&quot; votes. Voting will close at 1700 GMT. Preliminary results are expected after 1800 GMT. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
