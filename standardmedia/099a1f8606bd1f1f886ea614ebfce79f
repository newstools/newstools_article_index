ODM leader Raila Odinga&#39;s tour of Western region appears to have stirred Ford Kenya&#39;s Moses Wetang&#39;ula and Musalia Mudavadi of Amani National Congress (ANC) into action. The two have planned countrywide rallies to popularise themselves ahead of next year&#39;s elections. Mr Wetang&#39;ula,who is the Bungoma Senator, and Mr Mudavadi will kick off their rallies at the Coast, considered an ODM stronghold, but on different dates. Wetang&#39;ula will conclude his rallies in Western region where his CORD co-principal Raila camped for one week to stem rebellion by local MPs. Trouble in ODM was worsened when Budalang&#39;i MP Ababu Namwamba and Funyula&#39;s Paul Otuoma resigned as secretary general and vice chairman respectively. Raila also sought to counter President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s popularity after he made inroads in the region. Wetang&#39;ula sparked off a storm recently when he declared that Raila&#39;s third presidential bid will fail. And yesterday, he said the planned rallies aimed to popularise his Ford Kenya party and market him as the best bet for the CORD presidential ticket. Raila, Wetang&#39;ula and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka are tussling for CORD&#39;s presidential nomination ticket ahead of the 2017 General Election. &quot;I will embark on a countrywide tour starting August to popularise my party and underline my zeal to clinch the CORD presidential ticket,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula, who is also the Senate minority leader. The senator launched his presidential campaigns at Muliro Gardens in Kakamega County in April, an event Raila skipped. Wetang&#39;ula will then head for Eastern and North Eastern regions. In late August, he will move to Central and Rift Valley, largely considered President Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto&#39;s strongholds. &quot;I will reach every part of Kenya to look for votes and sell my manifesto to Kenyans. I will also listen to your concerns and decide what is best for this country,&quot; Wetang&#39;ula said. Mudavadi is expected at the Coast in September, when Wetang&#39;ula will be camping in Nairobi. In the same month, Wetang&#39;ula will take his campaigns to Raila&#39;s home turf in Nyanza and end his two-month tour in Western region where he is expected to traverse Kakamega, Busia, Vihiga, Bungoma and Trans-Nzoia counties.
