We refer to the article carried in The Standard on Sunday with the headlines &#39;Former PM named in KQ cargo saga&#39; on the front page and &#39;Raila named in questionable winding up of KQ&#39;s profitable cargo arm&#39; on pages 4 and 5 of the same edition. We regret any embarrassment caused to Raila Odinga out of the impression created by the headlines that he had been named and had a role in the closure of Kenya Airways cargo business. Accordingly, we apologise to Raila Odinga.
