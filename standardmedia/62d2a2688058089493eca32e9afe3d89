More than 100 members of the newly-formed Jubilee Party from Kitengela Rural yesterday defected to ODM citing frustration by party grassroots leadership. &nbsp;According to the defectors, they were not involved nor chosen during the recent Jubilee delegates conference in Nairobi. They further allege that even after raising concerns, party officials have continued to ignore them. In a charged public function held at Olorukoti village, Kitengela and attended by hundreds, the defectors vowed to ensure they rally support for ODM. &quot;I have been a true supporter of TNA but it is unfortunate that those at the helm are frustrating individuals irrespective of their influence on the ground,&quot; said Francis Kaesha who vied for the area MCA seat in the last General Election. Orange party election chairperson, who is also an East Africa legislator, Judith Pareno, said the move was a big boost to the party, adding that they are optimistic the party will regain its popularity in Kajiado. She said the dynamics of Maa politics is majorly focused on individuals and not party affiliations.
