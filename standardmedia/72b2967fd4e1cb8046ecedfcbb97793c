The Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) plans to regulate film and TV content delivered via the Internet. The board is seeking changes to the Film and Stage Play Act&nbsp; to incorporate emerging technological innovations in the sector such as YouTube and Netflix. This follows complaints from broadcasters and advertisers who accused the board of overstepping its mandate when KFCB tried to ban Netflix over what it described as immoral content. The Communication Authority of Kenya(CA) admitted that the country is yet to have laws to regulate film and TV content delivered via the Internet. &quot;The revision of the Act aims to accommodate emerging regulatory challenges brought about by new technologies and innovations in film production and distribution,&quot; said Mutua. More Kenyans are accessing film and TV content via the Internet without conforming their content as set in the country&#39;s regulations;including parental guidance classification.
