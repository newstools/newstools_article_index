Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula has urged Rift Valley residents to support him in his bid for the presidency. Speaking at the burial of the former Athletics Kenya President Isaiah Kiplagat in Eldoret yesterday, the CORD co-principal urged the Western and Rift Valley regions to co-operate and work closely together, stressing the need to create political rapport. He asked the region to support his presidential bid, saying attempts to eradicate tribal divisions and corruption have not been effective. He further stressed the importance of developing unity in the region to fight these vices. He also noted that Western and Rift Valley regions share common interests in agricultural development and working together will help them achieve suitable results. &quot;I have many friends here because we are neighbours hence share a lot in common. I was talking to my friend, the late Kiplagat, and realised our culture is closely sewn together, which endorses me to boldly ask for your support,&quot; Wetangula said. Wetang&#39;ula called on the residents to accommodate all politicians and shun leaders that create animosity, saying politics are seasonal but national unity should be always maintained.
