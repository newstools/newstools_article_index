The Departmental Health Committee of the National Assembly has launched an investigation into allegations that Mombasa&nbsp;Hospital&nbsp;in Mombasa County delayed emergency medical treatment on a patient because he lacked money to pay. Committee members arrived at the private&nbsp;hospital&nbsp;yesterday to investigate claims that it refused to admit 23-year-old Mohamed Bakari to its Intensive Care Unit unless his family deposited Sh300,000. The investigation was launched following a petition to the National Assembly by Embakasi South MP Irshad Sumra in August. The petition claims the&nbsp;hospital&nbsp;was&nbsp;negligent&nbsp;and refused to admit him for about five hours after referral from Safi&nbsp;Hospital&nbsp;where he had been rushed with food poisoning complications. In the petition, Mr Sumra asks the committee to investigate the matter to establish the cause of the alleged delay. Yesterday, Keiyo North MP Dr James Murgor acknowledged receiving the petition. He said the committee will recommend measures against the institution if it finds that it&nbsp;negligently&nbsp;refused to offer life saving treatment to the patient. The MP said that the Constitution provides for every person to receive emergency medical treatment without being subjected to pay. &quot;We have talked to the&nbsp;hospital&nbsp;management and the family and we will be making our report. We will take stern action if the&nbsp;hospital&nbsp;is found to have contravened the Constitution,&quot; said Dr Murgor.
