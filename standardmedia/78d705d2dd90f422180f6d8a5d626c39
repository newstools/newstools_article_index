KENYA: A man forged land documents and threw his father out of their home before selling the family land, a court heard Wednesday. Charles Muriuki told Nyeri Principal Magistrate&nbsp;Philip Wambua that his elder brother Stanley Njuki Muriuki chased their father from their home in Kiganjo when the old man demanded to know why he wanted to sell his two pieces of land. &ldquo;He started living with our father when our mother died in June 2010 but a year later, when he decided to actualise his plans to sell the land, he chased him away,&rdquo; Mr Muriuki testified. Njuki is accused of forging his father&rsquo;s signature and presenting a fake letter of consent and land transfer letter to enable him sell the two pieces of land. Peter Kagiri, the broker in the land deal, told the magistrate Njuki conspired with the area assistant chief who purportedly confirmed the land documents were genuine.

He (Njuki) assured us that the land was his since he had been given by his father,&rdquo; testified Kagiri. Kagiri added that Njuki lied to them that his father was critically ill and that was why he did not appear during the land transactions. Njuki is facing criminal charges of pretending that he had consent of transfer from his father and forging land documents. The case was filed on December 18, 2014, months after the accused sold the two pieces of land. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
