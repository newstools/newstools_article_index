A Nyeri court yesterday sentenced a man to life imprisonment for defiling and impregnating his 12-year-old daughter. Principal Magistrate Philip Mutua slapped Daniel Kariuki with the sentence for the offence committed between June 2013 and January 7, 2015 at Kakuna village, Nyeri. Kariuki was charged with incest, a sexual offence from which a girl child was born. &nbsp;&ldquo;The court has considered that the accused was remorseful and admitted to be a first offender although he blamed it on alcohol. It, therefore, finds the accused guilty and sentences him to life imprisonment,&rdquo; ordered Mutua. Kariuki had pleaded guilty, but claimed to have been drunk and asked for forgiveness. -Peter Mburu
