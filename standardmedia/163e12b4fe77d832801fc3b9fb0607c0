Detectives from the Anti-Terror Police Unit have arrested two National Social Security Fund (NSSF) officials on suspicion that they were linked to a terror group. The staff, in their late 20s, were arrested on Thursday over claims of recruiting youth in Isiolo to join Al-Shabaab. The duo were posted to Isiolo recently from the NSSF Garissa branch. Yesterday, Isiolo District Criminal Investigation Officer Peter Ndubi said, &quot;The suspects were arrested over claims of recruiting the youth. We are currently interrogating them.&quot; The suspects allegedly visit madrassas (Islamic religious schools) in estates in Isiolo town to recruit and radicalise youths. The arrest comes hot on the heels of revelations that six youths left for Elwak in Mandera County en-route to Somalia to join Al-Shabaab.
