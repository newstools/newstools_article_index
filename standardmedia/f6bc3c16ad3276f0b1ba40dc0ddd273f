With less than a year to the General Election, the county gubernatorial seat has attracted interest from many quarters. The aspirants want to unseat governor Jackson Mandago who they have accused of unfair distribution of resources and discrimination while hiring. Those eying the seat include Kenya High Commissioner in Islamabad Julius Bitok, Edward Serem who is the Chief Health Officer in Nandi County, Rael Rugut and Justus Misoi, both in business. Mandago beat Bitok in the 2013 polls and observers are predicting that the race will be a two-horse race between them. Bitok has publicly declared his interest in the race and is only waiting for the start of the official campaign period. &ldquo;Elections are still far and at the moment, I am positioning myself even as I watch the political trends in the region. The county deserves a leader who will provide equitable services to the electorate,&rdquo; Bitok said.

Mandago told The Standard that his desire for a second term is to enable him complete projects that he started in 2013. Three years on, the governor has been accused of taking credit for some projects funded by World Bank. Some locals have taken offence over his authoritative leadership, while others claim they have been sidelined in development projects and employment. &ldquo;Saying that I am discriminating is untrue. I have been working hard to ensure that I spread resources and job opportunities evenly because it is my wish that every region is improved,&rdquo; Mandago said. Dr Serem, 44, a first timer in the field of politics, maintains that he has the necessary qualities to transform the lives of constituents through citizen-oriented leadership.
