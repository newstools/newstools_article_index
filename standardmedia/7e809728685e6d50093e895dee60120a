Deputy President William Ruto has criticised Rift Valley leaders who stormed Moi University last week to protest the appointment of Prof Laban Ayiro as vice chancellor. Mr Ruto stressed that appointments should be done on merit and not through tribal considerations, as he condemned the action by two governors and several MPs who prefer Prof Isaac Kosgey. &ldquo;I believe there are enough people and enough institutions in Kenya to manage that situation. My very firm position is that whatever public appointments that are made should be made purely on merit,&rdquo; the DP said. He went on: &ldquo;Nobody should be given the job on any other account other than they are able and qualified, they have been interviewed, passed and the best we have. Nobody should be denied any opportunity on account of their religion or spelling of their names or where they come from.&rdquo; But in support of the local leaders on the university saga, hundreds of Uasin Gishu County residents held demonstrations in Eldoret town yesterday. The residents who gathered along Oginga Odinga Street yesterday firmly stated that governors Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu), Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet), MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret), Silas Tiren (Moiben) and James Bett (Kesses) were not advancing a tribal agenda but advocating for fair appointment of a substantive VC for Moi University.
