Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed&#39;s candidature for the African Union Commission chairmanship received a major boost after regional leaders threw their weight behind her. Leaders from the Common Markets for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) countries said they were supporting Kenya&#39;s decision to front Amina for the seat currently held by South African Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The leaders drawn from Malawi, Ethiopia, Madagascar and Rwanda voiced their support for Amina at a dinner hosted by Deputy President William Ruto for foreign affairs ministers in Antananarivo, Madagascar. Ethiopia&#39;s minister for Finance and Economic Co-operation, Ahmed Shide, said Amina&#39;s long and distinguished career in international affairs had enabled her to build the experience required for the position. &quot;I am confident she can serve our region well, especially in peace building and continental integration. She is able, forthright and articulate and has our support,&quot; said Mr Shide. His Malawian counterpart, Francis Lazalo Kasaila, said Amina was the preferred candidate to champion reforms on the continent.
