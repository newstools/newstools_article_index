The Industrial Court has stopped Kenya Airlines Pilots Association from calling a strike for its members to protest mismanagement at Kenya Airways. Justice Nduma Nderi restrained the pilots from going on strike following and urgent suit by Kenya Airways Limited. &ldquo;An order is issued restraining Kenya Airlines Pilots Association and their members from calling or participating in any industrial action, strike or a go-slow due to the ongoing restructuring at Kenya Airways Limited until the suit is heard and determined,&rdquo; ruled Justice Nderi. Kenya Airways Limited, through lawyer Obura Mbeche argued that the intended strike by pilots was ill-advised and meant to scuttle their restructuring programmes and make the national carrier incue more losses. Mr Mbeche submitted that a strike notice issued by the pilots was irregular since the reasons given for taking the action did not constitute part of their contract agreements. &ldquo;The intended strike will greatly inconvenience Kenya Airways customers and make the airliner suffer irredeemable losses. What the pilots have been doing cannot be allowed given their intention is to sabotage recovery plans put in place by Kenya Airways,&rdquo; said Mbeche.
