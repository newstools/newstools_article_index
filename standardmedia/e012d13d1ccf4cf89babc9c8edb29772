Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery has asked the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) to demand a public apology from the political leaders who attempted to stop newly appointed acting Vice Chancellor of Moi University from taking office. Nkaissery asked NCIC Chairman Francis ole Kaparo to prosecute the leaders if they fail to tender the apology, saying stern action must be taken on politicians seeking to incite members of the public. The CS castigated the actions by Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, his Elgeyo Marakwet counterpart Alex Tolgos and MPs Oscar Sudi, Silas Tiren and James Bett over their attempts to incite residents against Prof Laban Ayiro, who was appointed as acting Moi University VC. Nkaissery termed their actions as shameful, saying they should either publicly&nbsp;apologiseor be charged with crimes of inciting the public. &ldquo;A leader who attempts to stop a suitably qualified Kenyan from taking up a job in a public institution ostensibly because the appointee does not hail from the region where the institution is domiciled is not only breaking the law, but is also against the letter and spirit of the Constitution,&rdquo; said Nkaissery in a statement yesterday. He said political leaders should be in the forefront championing national cohesion and unity &ldquo;instead of propagating ethnic bigotry to score cheap and short-lasting political points&rdquo;. He said Prof Ayiro was at liberty to work anywhere in Kenya, both in the public and private sector.
