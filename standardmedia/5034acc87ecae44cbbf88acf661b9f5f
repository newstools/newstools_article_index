Deputy President William Ruto has sued equal rights activist Boniface Mwangi because of tweets he posted seemingly accusing him of murder, corruption and land grabbing. Through lawyer Kioko Kilukumi, Ruto moved to court yesterday under certificate of urgency, seeking orders compelling Mwangi to retract the &ldquo;defamatory&rdquo; tweets. &ldquo;We want Mwangi to be compelled to retract and delete the said tweet and apologise in all print and electronic media,&rdquo; says Kilukumi in court documents. Ruto is also seeking orders to have Mwangi restrained from tweeting any defamatory materials against him. He also wants to be paid damages for libel. Kilukumi claims that on September 28, Mwangi through Twitter handle, @bonifacemwangi, falsely and maliciously posted a tweet concerning Ruto. Ruto says that by reason of the publication of the words complained of, his name and reputation has been tarnished and tarred.
