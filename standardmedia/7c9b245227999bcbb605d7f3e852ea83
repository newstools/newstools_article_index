Two CORD senators have said the Opposition&#39;s delay in naming its presidential flag bearer is part of her wider strategy to beat Jubilee in polls. Senators Johnstone Muthama (Machakos) and James Orengo (Siaya) who are members of the CORD Management Committee yesterday said the delay was a deliberate effort to keep Jubilee guessing on who the coalition would front to face President Uhuru Kenyatta in the polls, which are just 10 months away. The senators assured the coalition&#39;s supporters that the Opposition will present a united front into the 2017 General Election despite the ongoing debate over the coalition&#39;s candidate for presidency. And speaking in Nairobi, CORD co-principal Moses Wetang&#39;ula told the coalition partners to stop the ongoing political grandstanding saying it would only help to hand the ruling coalition a second term in office. Wetang&#39;ula further welcomed suggestions of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi joining&nbsp; the Opposition.
