Only Parliament now stands between Justice David Maraga and his dream of becoming Kenya&#39;s next chief justice. Speaker of the National Assembly yesterday forwarded Justice Maraga&#39;s name to the House Justice and Legal Affairs Committee for vetting before MPs can make a final decision on his suitability for the office. The committee, chaired by Samuel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi), has 14 days to vet the nominee and table its report before the House. Interviews for the Deputy CJ post are ongoing.
