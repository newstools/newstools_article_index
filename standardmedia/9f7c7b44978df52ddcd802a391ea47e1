They have also been discriminated against,&quot; she said. The three pupils are battling a rare, incurable genetic disorder that peels their skin whenever they&#39;re exposed to the sun. According to Ms Hamadi, the three - Fatuma, aged nine, Rukia, who is seven and five-year-old Hamadi - developed freckles and small lumps on their faces at the age of six months.
