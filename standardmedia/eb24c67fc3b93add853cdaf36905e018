&nbsp; Kitui County Government will soon commission an oxygen manufacturing plant for use in the Kitui General Hospital and other health facilities in the county. The plant will cost Sh15million and will help save the lives of accident victims and mitigate other emergency health procedures. The facility that will serve the busy Kitui Level 5 Hospital has been mooted to help improve the quality of medical care in the county and in the process save millions of shillings spent annually to procure oxygen. According to the County Executive in charge of Heath Fred Muli the necessary equipment has already been brought in and the works are set to completed in record time. He said the County Government, under the stewardship of Julius Malombe has embarked on a major refurbishment of health facilities whose flagship is the major uplift of the General hospital. Under the project, a Sh60million Outpatient Centre that will include a casualty and emergency centre and host all the departments will be constructed. Muli also confirmed that the Ikutha Level 4 hospital will be opened to the public in November, once state of the art equipment that includes a radiology machine is installed. He said the equipment have already been received and are currently being fitted. The Ikutha hospital, built at a cost of Sh80million, will serve the hitherto marginalised but mineral rich Kitui South Constituency. Muli said the residents will no longer need to travel for more than 60 kilometres to Kitui Town in search of health facilities once the equipment are operational. &ldquo;The hospital will be fully pledged with paediatric, maternity, outpatient and inpatient amenities for the communities around Ikutha and its environs,&rdquo; he said.
