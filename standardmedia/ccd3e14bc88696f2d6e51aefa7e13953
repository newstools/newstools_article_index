Technical University of Mombasa will conduct a biometric exercise for easy identification of students. Acting Vice Chancellor Prof Laila Abubakar said the exercise, which begins next week, is expected to deter students from being lured by terrorist groups because they will be easily identified. Laila issued a stern warning to First Year students during orientation held at Kwale and the main campus at the weekend. &quot;As you settle down for your studies, you need to beware of the radicalisation issue which is with us. Terrorists are now targeting young university students like you to advance their mission,&quot; she warned. Her sentiments come in the wake of an attempted terror attack on Mombasa Central Police Station last Sunday.
