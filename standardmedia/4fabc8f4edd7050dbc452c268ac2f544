The military has been deployed to man areas along Samburu-Isiolo-Meru and Meru-Nanyuki roads to guard against terror attacks. The same measures have also been put in place in North Eastern and Coast regions. Impeccable sources from National Intelligence Service (NIS) and Anti-Terror Police Unit (ATPU) Thursday told The Standard the army has taken over the roadblocks in a bid to thwart attacks at key Kenya and British army installations. The soldiers are now manning roads from Archers Post in Samburu, Ngaremara in Isiolo, Maili Saba and Subuiga in Meru and close to Nanyuki town. All police barriers have been removed in Isiolo. The intelligence report indicate Al Qaeda linked Al Shabaab cells are active in Isiolo, adding they are planning to attack the British army bases at Archers Post in Samburu and Nanyuki in Laikipia County. The report also says the terrorists are out to target Kenya army bases at 78 Tank Battalion, School of Infantry (Isiolo), School of Artillery (Meru) and School of Combat Engineering (Isiolo). The report also says Al Shabaab plans to bomb tourists&rsquo; lodges located within Samburu, Isiolo and Meru game parks. The new report comes in the wake of an arrest of two terror suspects with bomb-making materials and maps of their key targets. Isiolo Criminal Investigation Officer David Cheruiyot and County Commissioner George Natembeya said the suspects were found with the materials in house at the sprawling Bulla Pesa Estate. The duo, said Mr Natembeya, are recruiters based in upper Eastern to recruit youth to become Al Shabaab fighters. The administrator said the army have been deployed to man roads as part of the &quot;war to stop terrorism and human smuggling&quot;. &quot;The guys (Al Shabaab) have shifted gear and we have to be ahead of them. The army have been there for a year and no alarm,&quot; he said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
