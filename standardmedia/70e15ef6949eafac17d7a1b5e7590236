A car that Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto was using on Tuesday evening was involved in an accident between Mai Mahiu and Suswa where one man lost his life. The man had alighted from a matatu which was parked along the road but as he hurried to cross the road in front of the matatu, Ruto&rsquo;s car unfortunately hit him, killing him on the spot. Both vehicles were headed towards Mai Mahiu but nobody was injured in the Governor&#39;s car during the accident. The driver swerved to avoid hitting the man but it was too late. The matatu escaped from the scene of the accident and they could not trace it afterwards. Ruto reported the matter at Mai Mahiu police station. Police arrived at the scene of the accident while Governor Ruto was still at Mai Mahiu following up on the matter. The Governor says he is sorry for the loss of life.
