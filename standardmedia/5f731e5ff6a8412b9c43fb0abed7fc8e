The court application sought orders for the bodies to be released to the family for burial without a postmortem examination. Most muslims object to postmortem examination of their dead kin. A caretaker at the cemetery , Mr Mohamed Ali told The Standard yesterday that he had prepared the graves ready for burial but by yesterday now no bodies have been brought there. &#39;&#39; I was later told that no burials will take place until some procedures are complete,&#39;&#39; he said. A passerby, who gave his first name as Bingo said that it is not normal for graves to be dug and left uncovered for long. &#39;&#39; It would be better if the graves are covered as they await the &#39;procedures&#39; to be completed,&#39;&#39; he said.
