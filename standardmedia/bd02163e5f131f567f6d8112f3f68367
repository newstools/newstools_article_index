Two traffic police officers were yesterday charged with stripping naked a schoolgirl and subjecting her to degrading treatment. The two were said to have taken nude photos of her and circulated them on social media on August 5, last year. Agnes Mwenda Magiri, who is the Sagana Traffic Base Commander, and constable Serah Wachira, however, denied committing the offence at the Kiangwachi Police Patrol Base in Kirinyaga West sub-county after the student was found with rolls of bhang. Kerugoya Chief Magistrate Francis Adai ordered the two be released on a Sh100,000 bond or Sh30,000 cash bail each. The case will be heard on three consecutive days from November 28.
