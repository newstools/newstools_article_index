NYERI: Three students have sued Dedan Kimathi University in Nyeri after they were suspended for a year each after they were allegedly caught cheating in examinations. Simon Ombolo, Isaack Hussein and Wycliffe Agutu want the High Court to stay the decision to kick them out of the institution. Ombolo, a second year student pursuing a degree in Mechatronic Engineering, was suspended after he was caught with condensed notes in the examination room. A committee set up to look into the cheating accusations came up with a guilty verdict and ruled that he be suspended for one academic year starting May 2016. He was to report back in January next year. The university&#39;s registrar of academic affairs Prof Jennifer Khamasi said in a&nbsp;sworn affidavit that the students were caught with material that were of interest to the examination they were taking, and which would have granted them unfair advantage over other students. The matter will be heard before Justice Jairus Ngaah on September 27.
