Manila: Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte appeared to liken himself to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on Friday and said he would &quot;be happy&quot; to exterminate 3 million drug users and peddlers in the country. Although the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama played down the remark, Duterte&#39;s comments triggered shock and anger among Jewish groups in the United States, which could create pressure on the U.S. government to take a tougher line with the Philippines leader. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a news conference following a meeting Southeast Asian defense chiefs in Hawaii that he personally found Duterte&#39;s comments &quot;deeply troubling&quot;, though the matter wasn&#39;t discussed at the meeting. State Department spokesman Mark Toner had earlier described Duterte&#39;s remarks, made in a rambling speech in Davao City, as &quot;a significant departure&quot; from America&#39;s partnership with the Philippines &quot;and we find them troubling.&quot; Duterte told reporters that he had been &quot;portrayed to be a cousin of Hitler&quot; by critics. Noting that Hitler had murdered millions of Jews, Duterte said, &quot;There are 3 million drug addicts (in the Philippines). I&#39;d be happy to slaughter them.

I would like (them) to be all criminals to finish the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition.&quot; U.N. special adviser on the prevention of genocide, Adama Dieng, expressed alarm and urged the Philippines leader to exercise restraint in his use of language, a U.N. statement said. Dieng also called on Duterte to support an investigation into the reported rise in killings resulting from his anti-drug campaign, the statement said. In August, Duterte threatened to withdraw the Philippines from the United Nations after it called for an end to the killings. In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman, Anna Richey-Allen, had repeated concerns about reports of extrajudicial killings but offered no response to Duterte&#39;s comment referring to Hitler.
