The fate of the occupants of Kedong Ranch in Naivasha now lies in the hands of appellate judges. &nbsp;The Maasai who claim ownership of the land filed an appeal to challenge a judgement delivered by a Nakuru court on September 24, 2015. &nbsp;An appellate bench led by Justice Anne Okwengu will decide whether the occupants will be evicted or allowed to stay. Ms Okwengu is teaming up with justices Patrick Kiage and Jamila Mohammed. Justice Sila Munyao of the Environment and Lands Court in Nakuru had dismissed a petition claiming the community&#39;s rights had been violated.
