Chancellors of public universities now want President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop political interference in the management of their institutions. They said universities are torn between meeting public interest and pampering political whims, which was hurting academic functions. The plea was made yesterday during the second roundtable discussions on policies, regulations and standards for universities. And speaking at the forum, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i said bad governance and politicisation of education were threatening to bring down university education. Matiang&#39;i asked chancellors to adopt conflict resolution mechanisms to arbitrate internal issues before they spring out of control. He said the ministry will support the establishment of chancellor&#39;s forum, which shall be done twice a year.
