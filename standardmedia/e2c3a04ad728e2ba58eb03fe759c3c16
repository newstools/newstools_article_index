Nyeri, Kenya: Impeachment motion against Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua sails through after MCAs garner two-thirds majority. Decision to be forwarded to Senate. Governor Nderitu Gachagua impeached was successful after 35 against 47 voted in favor of his removal. The impeachment motion had been tabled amid previous unsuccessful attempts to reconcile the governor and the MCAs. Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe had met both the Executive and the MCAs in an apparently failed attempt to iron out the differences. However, Gachagua had maintained that the current stand-off was to be solved by December. Gachagua survived a previous impeachment motion by the assembly, where his Grand Nation Union party (GNU) has nine MCAs against The National Alliance&rsquo;s (TNA) 36. Mathari MCA Baragu Mutahi had been handpicked to move the motion and was confident it would be passed, as 35 MCAs were already in support.
