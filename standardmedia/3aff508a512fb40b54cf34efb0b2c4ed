Residents of West Yimbo, Siaya County scramble for hippo meat after it was shot dead by Kenya Wildlife Services Officers. (Photo/Isaiah Gwengi) Residents of Bondo sub-county in Siaya have appealed to the Government to protect them from hippos that have so far caused deaths and injuries, and destroyed property. The most hit are horticultural farmers along the banks of River Yala, who are counting losses after the animals destroyed acres of their crops. The farmers led by Michael Onyina decried the increasing number of hippos that have severely damaged their farms over the last one week. &quot;The animals have destroyed our crops including kales (Sukuma wiki), spinach, tomatoes and onions, and we are appealing to the Government to help in restraining these animals from getting into our farms,&quot; said Mr Onyina. The most affected areas are Abom and Ajigo sub-locations. The farmers said the farms, which used to produce at least 1,000kg of sukuma wiki per day have completely been flattened by the marauding hippos. Left helpless Onyina whose crops have completely been destroyed said they have now been left helpless as a result of the destruction. &quot;We entirely depend on these farms to eke a living and it will be very bad to see our source of livelihood being destroyed by animals,&quot; he added. Another resident, George Otieno, accused the Government of being complacent and even uncaring in the face of complaints arising from human-animal conflicts. &quot;The animals have left a trail of damage on our crops and we are afraid that they will start getting into the homes that are closer to the lake,&quot; said Mr Otieno. The farmers want the animals confined within their habitat so as to give them room to continue with their farming activities uninterrupted. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
