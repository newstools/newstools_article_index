County ministers will now be expected to appear before the county assembly to respond to queries about their dockets after MCAs passed a motion to that effect. &nbsp;Sponsoring the motion, Wamumu MCA Kinyua Mutugi said yesterday that he took the initiative because committees were unable to provide responses on behalf of the ministers in charge of various departments. &nbsp;&quot;Our colleagues who sit on various statutory committees are not able to provide the assembly with satisfactory answers because we are not technocrats,&quot; he said.
