A five-year-old girl in Teso South constituency has been allegedly defiled by a Standard Six pupil. The 15-year-old boy is said to have lured the nursery school girl to a nearby river where he defiled her. &ldquo;Passersby heard the girl screaming along the river and when they rushed there, they found the boy in the act. He managed to flee but witnesses were able to identify him,&rdquo; said the victim&rsquo;s father. The girl was taken to Alupe Sub-County Hospital for medication while the suspect was arrested. The girl&rsquo;s parents have called on the police to ensure justice is properly served. CASES ON RISE The incident comes barely two weeks after an 18-year-old boy raped a 70-year-old woman in the same area. Cases of rape and defilement in the sub-county have been on the rise in the past one year.

Old women drink foolishly with young men until late hours of the night and on their way home, they encounter teenagers who are also drunk and who force them into having sex,&rdquo; said Mary Akolo, a resident of Amkura. Teso South MP Mary Emase has started awareness campaigns in churches and public forums to address the problem. Ms Emase wants discos played at funerals banned, and interventions to reduce alcoholism.
