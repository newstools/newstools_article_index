He assured his supporters that he would soon present his manifesto that will transform Kilifi County. He will face incumbent Amason Kingi. &ldquo;After Jubilee Party, the next move we will be go round to explain why we joined Jubilee and how it will benefit our people. I will lead my team which includes Governor Mvurya and Governor Timamy in a spirited campaign in Mombasa beginning with Likoni and Kisauni. I will prove who between Joho and I has a bigger following in Coast,&rdquo;&nbsp;Mung&rsquo;aro&nbsp;said. Mung&rsquo;aro&nbsp;was flanked by MPs Khatib Mwashetani of Lungalunga, Mustafa Idd (Kilifi South), Zainab Chidzuga (Kwale women representative), Ganze MP Peter Shehe, senators Emma Mbura and Mvita Kisasa,&nbsp;former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana among others.
