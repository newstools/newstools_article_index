Busia County government will no longer give bursaries to students in institutions of higher learning. Instead, Deputy Governor Kizito Wangalwa has advised students in colleges, technical institutions and universities to seek loans from Higher Education Loans Board (HELB) and other financial institutions. &quot;This is geared towards encouraging youths to be responsible by acquiring the loans and servicing them upon completion of studies,&quot; Wangalwa said Thursday. He added: &quot;We have resolved that bursaries will only be given to secondary school students. Those in universities and other post-secondary institutions will have to use to get loans from other sources and educate themselves.&quot; Last year, the county government signed an agreement with HELB to offer loans to local students after which Sh27 million was released. The county government had planned to allocate Sh55 million to the programme. And Thursday, Wangalwa who spoke in Busia town urged the post-secondary students to embrace the current development.
