WASHINGTON:&nbsp;The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday signaled a willingness to reduce the potentially huge penalties for ripping off a patented design as it heard arguments in the legal fight over the amount Samsung should pay Apple for copying the iPhone&#39;s trademarked appearance. The eight justices heard arguments by lawyers for the world&#39;s two top smartphone manufacturers, as well as the U.S. government, in Samsung&#39;s challenge to the $399 million it was forced to pay Apple for violating three patents regarding the iPhone&#39;s rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons.
