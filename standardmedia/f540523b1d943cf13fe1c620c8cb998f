A motion to impeach Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero was tabled yesterday at the City County Assembly. The motion was yesterday tabled by Viwandani MCA Samuel Nyangwara despite protest from CORD-affiliated MCAs who were eager to interrupt House business. Trouble began after Speaker Alex Magelo ordered Eastleigh South MCA Nelson Masiga to leave the chambers and barred him from accessing the premises for 30 days, citing misconduct. Masiga, together with other members, had been protesting against what they termed as strict and unnecessary rules by the speaker even before the motion had been read out. Mr Magelo had given orders that no one should heckle Nyangwara as he read the notice of motion. The Eastleigh South MCA, however, defied Magelo&#39;s directive and sought the backing of other party members in confronting the sergeants-at-arms who were bent on kicking him out.

Some members from CORD tried to grab the mace in a bid to halt House business as others battled with sergeants-at-arms in trying to protect Mr Masiga. Eventually, Nyangwara was able to read out the notice of motion to impeach Kidero as Jubilee MCAs formed a human shield from his &#39;rivals&#39;. House committee Magelo then directed the House business committee, which he chairs, to allocate the motion time for debate. The committee has until Tuesday to present the motion to the assembly and three days thereafter for the motion to be dispensed with by members. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
