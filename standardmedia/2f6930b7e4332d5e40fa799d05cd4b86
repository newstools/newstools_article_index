A joint military operation between Chad and Niger has killed 123 Boko Haram militants since July and recovered a significant quantity of weapons, Niger&rsquo;s Defence Ministry said on Friday. Allied Chadian-Nigerian forces launched an offensive against the Islamists after a surprise attack in Niger killed 30 of the country&rsquo;s troops in early June, its deadliest ever attack there. Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Moustapha Ledru said 14 of the two nations&rsquo; own troops had also died and 39 had been wounded in fighting with the Nigerian militant group over the same period. &ldquo;An important quantity of arms and weapons were recovered,&rdquo; he added. Boko Haram is waging a guerrilla war to establish a breakaway Islamic caliphate around the Lake Chad region, where Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad meet. Ledru said a parallel offensive involving Nigerian forces had recaptured four towns from the Islamists, whose insurgency has killed thousands and displaced 2.4 million.
