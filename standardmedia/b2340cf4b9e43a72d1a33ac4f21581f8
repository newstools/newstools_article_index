A State agency has exposed counties whose key&nbsp;employment criteria since 2013 appears to be that&nbsp;you must be ethnically-correct, meaning you must&nbsp;have been born there, to get an employment letter.&nbsp; The report put together by the National Cohesion&nbsp;and Integration Commission (NCIC) lifts the&nbsp;mask on 32 counties that have violated the law on&nbsp;ethnic balance and diversity in public service employment.&nbsp; The study, commissioned by NCIC for the past&nbsp;four years, names the counties that have been&nbsp;turned into employment bureaus for the &lsquo;sons and &nbsp;daughters of the soil.&rdquo; The picture could have been more telling were it not that cosmopolitan&nbsp;counties&nbsp;escaped the negative rating because of the multiplicity of ethnic groups and the political influence those elected among them wield in recruitment. County&nbsp;Public Service boards in the 32&nbsp;counties&nbsp;have disregarded a quota reserved for hiring employees to ensure ethnic diversity and instead filled positions with people from the local community. Some have up to 97 per cent of employees from their tribes, which violates Section 65 of the&nbsp;County&nbsp;Government Act (2012) that proposes 70 per cent of jobs be given to locals and 30 per cent be reserved for experts from outside these areas.

Only 15&nbsp;counties&nbsp;(31.9 per cent) have adhered to the law, giving over 30 per cent of vacancies at entry level to members of ethnic groups that are not dominant in their jurisdictions. &ldquo;This implies new recruitment continues to contravene the provisions of the existing law,&rdquo; stated the&nbsp;report&nbsp;titled &lsquo;Ethnic and Diversity Audit of the&nbsp;County&nbsp;Public Service.&rsquo; NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo said the study was conducted as a way of ensuring that&nbsp;county&nbsp;governments strive to be more inclusive. He told Kenyans to remain vigilant in holdingcounties&nbsp;accountable for the obligations vested on them by law. &ldquo;By publishing this&nbsp;report, the commission has presented the country with policy recommendations to ensure ethnic equality and equitable distribution of opportunities in the&nbsp;county&nbsp;public service,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;If well implemented, this will enhance unity of purpose among Kenyans from all walks of life.&rdquo; Bomet, headed by Governor Isaac Ruto, hired 97.9 per cent of 330 new employees from his Kalenjin community. Kirinyaga&nbsp;County&nbsp;was also flagged in the&nbsp;report&nbsp;for skewed appointments after it hired 97.6 per cent of 569 new staff from the Kikuyu community. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
