Today is International Day of Older Persons and what better way to mark it than with the story of a remarkable granny. Forget Emma Morano of Italy who is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest at 116. Mary Tapasian from Kajiado believes she is the world&rsquo;s oldest living being. According to her children, Mary has more than 300 descendants. She has ten children and 74 grandchildren. One grandchild is 58 years, yet he isn&rsquo;t even the oldest. One son is 95 years old and hardly gets out of bed. Her eldest son died in 2014. He was 104 years old then. But how old is Mary? Her identity card says she is 112, having been born in 1904, but her family insists she is much older. Maybe 130 years old. It could be. If Mary&rsquo;s late son would have been 106 this year, then, according to her official age, she gave birth to him when she was only six! Her family cherish her. &ldquo;During her birthday in 2013, all her descendants were here and we were more than 300,&rdquo; says Daniel Tapasian, her 77-year old fifth child. Though she is blind, is partially deaf and visibly frail, she is still mentally sharp and cracks jokes now and then. This granny is not only lively, but is also very generous. Her son says when her younger grandchildren visit her on their way to boarding school, she gives them pocket money and blesses them. Jovial woman &ldquo;When we were young, if you were in low spirits, she was the person to talk to. Should would make you laugh with her many jokes. There is never a dull moment with her. And she is very generous too. I think she sacrifices too much for the happiness of others,&rdquo; Daniel says. But pray what is her secret to such a long life? Well milk, meat, soup and animal fat, she says. And she does not eat food fried with commercial cooking fat. Her food is fried in animal fat or ghee. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
