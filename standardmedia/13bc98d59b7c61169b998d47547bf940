An AP officer and a female college student were yesterday charged with robbing Tharaka Nithi Deputy Governor Eliud Mati of Sh3.5 million. Josphat Kipyegon and Rose Kajira appeared before Principal Magistrate Stella Abuya and denied the charges of robbery with violence and handling stolen property respectively. Mr Kipyegon was charged with being armed with a firearm containing 12 bullets and robbing Mr Mati of the money in Kinoru, Meru County, on October 12. Ms Kajira, who appeared pensive, was accused of depositing Sh1.4 million, suspected to be part of the stolen money, in a KCB account in Isiolo County on the same date. Both pleaded not guilty and were remanded in custody in spite of a spirited attempt by their lawyers to get them out on the argument that one was a police officer and the other a student. SEVEN DAYS READ MORE Police officer in Sh3.5 million heist fails to take plea Bodyguard denies robbing Deputy Governor of Sh3.5 million Defence lawyers Kiautha Arithi and Kiogora Mugambi differed with State Counsel Antony Musyoka, who asked the magistrate to detain the two in police custody for seven days to enable them to complete investigations. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see why the accused have been charged before conclusion of investigations,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Mr Mugambi. He also claimed Kipyegon&rsquo;s house within the deputy governor&rsquo;s compound had been ransacked and his Sh80,000 stolen. &ldquo;He cannot access his house and everything has been taken,&rdquo; he said. Ms Abuya said Kipyegon was free to report the matter to the police. But Mr Kiogora quoted detectives handling the case from a newspaper story (not The Standard) who said they had completed investigations. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
