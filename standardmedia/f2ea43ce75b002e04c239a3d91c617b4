Nominated MP Patrick Wangamati has hinted that Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula might abandon the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) if he does not become the Opposition&#39;s presidential flag bearer. He said the party will not accept anything short of Wetang&#39;ula becoming CORD&#39;s presidential nominee. &quot;Time has come for Raila to pay back. We want Wetang&#39;ula to be the flag bearer or else we will have to chart our own political journey as a party,&quot; he said. The MP claimed that Raila was keen on contesting the presidency on an ODM ticket, arguing that the ODM leader has of late showed less interest in CORD matters. However, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa said the coalition was united, and called on the three CORD principals to craft a formula that will help them pick a presidential candidate in 2017. &quot;We are all praying that Senator Wetang&#39;ula becomes CORD&#39;s flag bearer. We, however, don&#39;t have strict demands because we know he will emerge the best if the selection is conducted fairly,&quot; said Wamalwa.
