NAIROBI: ODM took its campaigns to the constituency of one of its MPs who has defected to Jubilee Party. In the Nairobi series of campaigns, the party leaders held a rally in Mathare constituency, whose representative, Steven Kariuki, joined the ruling coalition in a parallel meeting some kilometres away. In the Huruma meeting, the ODM leaders vowed that the Opposition will beat the Jubilee administration in next year&#39;s elections. Led by ODM deputy party leader, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, and his Nairobi counterpart, Evans Kidero, the leaders accused Jubilee of being insensitive to the plight of the many suffering Kenyans. Mr Joho rallied support for Raila&#39;s presidential candidature, saying ODM will change the lives of Kenyans. &quot;The Jubilee government has failed to improve the lives of Kenyans. Raila will change the lives of Kenyans and make sure that there is equality,&quot; said Joho.

He said the next stop for ODM [email&#160;protected] is Eldoret, the political home turf of Deputy President William Ruto, then Murang&#39;a and Kisumu. The leaders accused the Jubilee administration of &#39;eating the meat meant for all Kenyans&#39; while the electorate are left languishing in abject poverty. In a thinly veiled analogy, the ODM brigade likened the &#39;meat&#39; to corruption dogging the Jubilee administration, including the National Youth Service (NYS) scandal and the Eurobond billions. The ODM brigade cruised through the streets of Nairobi from Kawangware through to Kibera, town centre, Kariakor, Eastleigh and Mathare before a rally at Muliro Gardens in Huruma.
