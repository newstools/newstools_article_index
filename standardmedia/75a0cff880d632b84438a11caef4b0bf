KENYA: Twelve people were Friday arraigned in a Nakuru court and charged with sale of adulterated fuel without licenses. The suspects were arrested on Thursday at Sobea Rongai Sub-County when police officers raided one of the premises they operate their business in. While in the premise, the officers managed to nab 29, 000 liters of diesel, 10,000 liters of paraffin and 78,000 liters of petrol stored in large containers. Appearing before Chief Magistrate David Kemei they all denied the charges. Their lawyer Wachira Waiganjo applied to have them released on bond terms a mater which the prosecution did not object. The prosecutor Hillary Sungoyo told the court that the content was worth disposing since they pose danger to the people living in the area considering that they were highly inflammable. He wanted the matter heard on priority basis.

The magistrate directed that the dealer be sought. This would serve a reprieve to the accused persons as the court might acquit them of the charge and hold the owner responsible and for the charge. The business which seems to thrive is done mostly along the highways. It is alleged that the dealers mix petroleum products which they later sell them to consumers at a lower price. They were released on sh100, 000 bond each with surety of similar amount. Their case will be mentioned on September 5, 2016.
