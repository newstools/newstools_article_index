A suspected thief was lynched and several houses torched in Ulanda village in Awendo sub-county. The incident occurred yesterday when more than 100 irate boda boda operators raided the village in search of stolen motorbikes. The boda boda operators pounced on the middle-aged man and beat him up, forcing him to mention his accomplices before killing him and setting his house ablaze. The other suspects fled, but their houses were torched. Area chief Jirus Were confirmed that one of the stolen motorbikes and other personal properties were recovered in one of the suspects&#39; houses before they were torched. Cases of insecurity and theft have been on the rise in the volatile sugar belt region of Awendo. Last week, angry residents took to the streets of Awendo town and barricaded the road with burning tyres, paralysing transport for the better part of the day. The protest was triggered by a spate of killings in the area.
