The delay of a case in which six men are accused of burning a Sh2 million residential house belonging to a business woman has raised alarm. Nyeri Principal Magistrate Philip Wambua said that it was an embarrassment that the case has not been heard for two years. &quot;It is a shame that for two years, this case has not been heard for no reason at all,&quot; said Mr Wambua. The accused six complained through their lawyer Wahome Gikonyo that they were not granted access to the police report and other documents concerning the case. The case will now be mentioned on September 12, 2016.
