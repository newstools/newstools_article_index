Doctors in Nyeri started their strike yesterday as patients in other health facilities in other counties continue to suffer due to ongoing health workers&rsquo; strikes. Yesterday, patients were attended to by unsupervised interns and clinical officers as doctors stayed away from the health centres. Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentist Union Nyeri Branch Secretary Goody Gor said doctors in the county were fatigued due to long working hours since the county had put off employment of more doctors. The county government has been mum on the issue even though the doctors issued a strike notice on September 5. Ms Gor said the County Executive Member for Health Dr Charles Githinji and Chief Officer Dr Peter Munyua were not keen on meeting the doctors&rsquo; union to address their grievances despite numerous requests for meetings. &ldquo;We have attempted to contact both of them but our calls and letters have not been answered. Dr Githinji promised to call back but has not,&rdquo; she said. The doctors are also protesting the lack of promotion and denial of leave to pursue post-graduate studies.

Gor claimed the county had reneged on its promise to release 13 doctors to further their education. &ldquo;Some of us were forced to defer post-graduate studies last year but we cannot do it for again,&rdquo; she said, adding the move has prompted some doctors to quit. KMPDU officials are set to meet County Secretary Alice Wahome. &nbsp; &nbsp;
