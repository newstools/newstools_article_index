Five former employees of the East African Portland Cement Company (EAPCC) have sued the firm&#39;s Managing Director Simon Peter Ole Nkeri for contempt of court after he failed to reinstate them. The five had been reinstated by Labour and Employment Court Judge Hellen Wasilwa but the MD has not effected the court orders. Justice Wasilwa had directed that Mr Benjamin Mwendwa Ndauiti, Ibrahim Mugo, Evans Abuga, Desmond Owiyo and Felix Vunga be reinstated after the court found that they were dismissed unfairly. But five months since the judgement, EAPCC is yet to reinstate them, prompting them to file a suit in a Nairobi court seeking to have the company&#39;s MD jailed for six months for disobeying the court order. They were represented by lawyer Edward Oonge.
