Two Naivasha-based Kenya Revenue Authority officers yesterday appeared before a Nakuru court charged with soliciting a bribe from a hotel owner in Naivasha. David Okemwa and Peter Osebe are said to have solicited a bribe of Sh150,000 from Lake Side Tourist Lounge in Naivasha on December 11, 2015. The officers allegedly visited the hotel and summoned its directors to KRA offices, accusing them of producing electronic tax registers selectively.
