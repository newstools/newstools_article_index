Close to 200 police officers have been deployed to the revamped Highway Patrol Unit (HPU). The officers are drawn from various police stations in the country. They will now report to the HPU based at Traffic headquarters under Mr Karisa Mwaringa and be allocated the routes to man. HPU was formed in 2005 to exclusively fight crime and enforce traffic rules along the main highways. It was, however, neglected, especially with the coming in of the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA), which appeared to take over its mandate. The officers will, among others, be part of a special unit to secure the northern corridor from Nairobi to Busia and clear the road to facilitate easier movement of goods. The formation of the unit was jointly announced by&nbsp; Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and his Ugandan counterpart Maj Gen Kale Kayihura.

COMMON OBJECTIVE Uganda has been complaining of slow movement of goods from Mombasa due to various reasons including corruption. The new team will now address the issues and ensure fast and secure movement of goods. Those moved in the changes announced by police headquarters include nine assistant superintendents, 20 inspectors and 20 sergeants. They will supplement those seconded to the NTSA, which has been running the show on the major highways. Mr Boinnet said the move will help achieve the common objective of a safe, reliable, efficient transport system and proper enforcement of traffic laws. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
