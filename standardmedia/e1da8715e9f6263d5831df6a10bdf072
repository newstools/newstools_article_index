Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka is under pressure to calm the political temperature in parts of Ukambani over the party nominations. A section of Kitui professionals and leaders have urged their senator, David Musila, to relinquish his post as the party chairman willingly or be forced out through mass protests. Musila is being accused of conspiracy to lock out Governor Julius Malombe from getting the party ticket for his re-election. The governor has also accused top Wiper officials of plans to rig him out of nominations so as to lock him out of the governor race in 2017. &quot;We will scuttle any attempts to interfere with the nominations as time is long gone when political parties handpicked candidates. Why is he finding it hard to relinquish the party position and let the people of Kitui decide who they want as their next governor,&quot; he posed. Dr Malombe criticised Musila&#39;s resoluteness to remain as the party chairman even as they compete for the county&#39;s top job in next year&#39;s general elections.

Malombe implored on Kalonzo to move with speed and give clear direction on the nominations, as the party was on the verge of disintegration. But Kalonzo said that the party will consider inviting the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to conduct the nominations. &quot;We want to ensure there is free, fair and credible nominations. As a party leader, I would not want a fall out because of nominations; that will also frustrate my ambition,&quot; he said.
