The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has rescheduled summons of 15 MCAs to Monday. This paves the way for MCAs to debate an impeachment motion against Governor Nderitu Gachagua this morning. There was fear that the summons over last week&#39;s brawl would scuttle the impeachment motion which requires a two-thirds majority in the 47-member assembly to sail through. EACC Director Jackson Mue Thursday said: &quot;We have since rescheduled their summons. When we sent out the invitations we were not aware of the motion and we have accepted that they appear on Monday.&quot; Assembly speaker Mwangi Mugo had written to the commission requesting that the summons be rescheduled to ensure all MCAs are in the House today to debate the motion. Some MCAs had read malice, saying the summons were meant to deny them the two-thirds threshold.

Fifteen MCAs had received summons to appear before EACC, with Mr Gituanja saying the members in question had written to EACC confirming that they had received the summons. &quot;They have requested that they be allowed to appear on any other day, but not on Friday,&quot; Mr Gituanja said. Speaking at the funeral service of the late James Gathogo, a former Gakawa&nbsp; Councillor in Kieni East, MCAs vowed to to push through with the impeachment motion. Mr Gituanja alleged that some members had been receiving threats, while others were being followed by unknown people. &quot;We are a hundred per cent sure it will sail through despite threats and intimidation,&quot;Kirimukuyu MCA James Kibira said.
