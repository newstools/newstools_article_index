NAIROBI: A man claiming to be the son of former Narok North MP William Ole Ntimama has gone to court to stop his burial. George Kariuki Njoroge alias George Kariuki Ntimama claims that he is a biological son to the late Mr Ntimama but his family has refused to recognise him or allow him to participate in preparations for the burial slated for Wednesday September 14. &ldquo;Despite being a biological son to Mr Ntimama, his family have refused to allow me participate in his burial plans. They have been hostile to me and would not allow me near their place,&rdquo; said Njoroge. He wants an order stopping Mr Ntimama&rsquo;s widow Dorcas Pedelei Ntimama or any other person from collecting the body from Lee Funeral Home until a DNA test is done to ascertain his paternity. Mr Ntimama, 86, died at his Narok home on September 2 and was scheduled to be buried tomorrow (Saturday) but the burial was postponed to September 14 to allow family members and his friends outside the country attend the burial. Mr Ntimama&rsquo;s last public appearance was on August 22 when he endorsed Narok West MP Patrick Ntutu to vie for the governor seat in next year general elections. He served as chairman of Narok County Council for 15 years and later as MP for Narok North for 25 years.
