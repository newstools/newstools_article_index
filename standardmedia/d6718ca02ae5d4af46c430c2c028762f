Private sugar millers have been asked to develop their own cane to reduce cases of cane poaching. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett blamed cane poaching on millers buying the produce directly from farmers instead of contracting them. Speaking after a meeting with Nzoia Sugar management yesterday, Mr Bett said millers should contract farmers and draw a specific schedule on how cane should be harvested. &ldquo;Millers should develop their own cane. They should not reap where they have not invested,&rdquo; he said. He said a committee has been formed to determine the minimum price farmers should be paid upon delivering their cane to millers.
