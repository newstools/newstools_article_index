Ford Kenya Secretary General Eseli Simiyu has cautioned against infighting between the county leaders, saying it is detrimental to the party&rsquo;s development agenda. The Tongaren MP noted that cracks between leaders in the county has made it difficult to concentrate on development and has portrayed the party in bad light. On several occasions, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa has criticised Governor Patrick Khaemba&rsquo;s administration, accusing it of corruption, but the latter has defended his track record and dismissed the corruption allegations. - Wilberforce Netya
