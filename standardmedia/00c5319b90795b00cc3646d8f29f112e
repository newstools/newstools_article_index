Cereal farmers in Uasin Gishu County have said they will demonstrate on Monday if the Government does not increase maize and wheat prices. The farmers said the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) depots were offering very low prices of Sh2,300 per 90kg of maize against their expectation of Sh3,000. &ldquo;It is so painful for farmers to demonstrate every year for the Government to address our needs yet we are the foundation of the economy,&rdquo; Kimutai Kolum said. - Michael Ollinga
