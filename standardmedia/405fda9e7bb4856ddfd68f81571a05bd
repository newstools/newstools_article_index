Upgrade works on Ikanga Airstrip to make it an all-weather facility is nearing completion, Governor John Mruttu has said. Already, a 1.5km-long runway of bitumen standards has been laid. &quot;We are upbeat that small commercial airlines will start landing at the airstrip, which will open up the entire county to air transporters,&quot; said Mr Mruttu. He said the county government was in talks with the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority about granting licences to air operators. &quot;We plan to further engage the parent Ministry of Transport and private air operators on the need to market the airfield as we seek to attract air traffic into Taita Taveta,&quot; said the governor. He added that part of the support infrastructure such as a fire engine and ambulance were already made available.
