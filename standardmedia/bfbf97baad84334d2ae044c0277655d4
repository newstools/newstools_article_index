Provision of health services in Meru County is likely to improve following the enactment of a legislation spelling out how medical facilities will be managed. If the bill is assented to by Governor Peter Munya, all health facilities will be run by a board of management comprising representatives from the community, religious groups, financial and human resource management experts. The bill, according to the Assembly Health Committee chairperson Joan Gacheri, came about after residents complained about the poor state of services rendered at the county&rsquo;s hospitals. &mdash;Phares Mutembei
