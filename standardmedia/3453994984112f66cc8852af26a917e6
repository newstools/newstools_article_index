The Law Society of Kenya has shown a rare gesture to the public. While marking the LSK Legal Awareness Week, over 8,000 lawyers will offer free legal services from September 26 to September 30. They will also offer the pro bono (free legal services) to prisoners and remandees in Nairobi prisons. Asking the public to reach out for the services, LSK CEO Mercy Wambua said the Legal Awareness Week will be marked under the theme Improving Access to Justice through Alternative Dispute Resolution. LSK is mandated by law to advise and assist members of the legal profession, Government and the public in all matters relating to the administration of justice. It is sad that many citizens cannot access justice despite provisions of Article 48 of the Constitution that guarantees every Kenyan the right of access to justice on an equal basis. Wananchi should avail themselves of this opportunity and benefit from free legal services on land, succession, family, human rights, alternative dispute resolution and accident compensation. In a country where the majority cannot access justice because of the prohibitive cost of representation, this will go a long way in creating public awareness. LSK&rsquo;s new leadership can surely reach out to society with more of such initiatives.
