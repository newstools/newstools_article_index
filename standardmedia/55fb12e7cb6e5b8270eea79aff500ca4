Opposition leader Raila Odinga will not endorse anyone for the presidency in next year&rsquo;s General Election. Instead, the ODM party leader declared that competitive nomination will be the only way to pick CORD&rsquo;s presidential flag bearer, dashing hopes of his partners, who have been seeking his endorsement.

The ODM leader likened the contest to suitors trying to win over a beautiful girl. &ldquo;This is a beautiful girl and everyone is trying to market themselves, saying I am the best suited. The girl will make a decision,&rdquo; said Raila, yesterday. Raila made the remarks even as he downplayed claims of cracks within the Opposition coalition over the picking of its presidential candidate.
