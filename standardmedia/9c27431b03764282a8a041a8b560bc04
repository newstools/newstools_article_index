A traffic police officer yesterday admitted he received money from a breakdown owner for notifying him whenever there were accidents. Corporal Kofa Wayu Ali was responding to questions over money he received from Nabil Aziz, a breakdown owner in Nakuru town. &quot;The money we received was given as a token of appreciation by Mr Aziz to officers who were on stand-by for accidents. We would notify him when there were accidents, which had caused road obstruction,&quot; he told the Johnston Kavuludi-led National Police Service Commission vetting panel. He said the money from the businessman did not taint his integrity because it was not solicited. &quot;We used to exchange phone numbers with them and they would send us the money after the accident. This doesn&#39;t compromise my integrity as we didn&#39;t solicit for the money,&quot; he said.
