Ford Kenya top organ meets on Tuesday next week to pick an interim chairman following the defection of its national chair, Turkana Senator John Munyes to Jubilee Party (JP). Kwanza MP Ferdinand Wanyonyi said the party&rsquo;s National Executive Council will meet and deliberate on the defections and fill the vacant positions. Speaking in Kitale during a meeting, Wanyonyi who is the Trans Nzoia branch chairman urged party supporters to stand firm and ignore those luring them to join JP. Munyes joined Jubilee and plans to take on CORD&rsquo;s Josphat Nanok, the incumbent Turkana governor.
