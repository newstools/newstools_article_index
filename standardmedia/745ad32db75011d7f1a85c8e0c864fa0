A 32-year-old mother of three who was shot by a warder at Meru&#39;s Uruku Prison has died after weeks in a coma. Catherine Muthoni Nyawira, was shot in the head on August 29 by a constable who went berserk at the prison located in Imenti Central sub-county. The warder ran amok during a violent disagreement with his wife. In the ensuing scuffle, his wife ran out of their house but the angry warder ran after her. On the way, he ran into a colleague carrying a gun, which he snatched and fired at his wife. But the bullet hit Ms Nyawira, who was in the prison compound, instead. The warder finally managed to get hold of his wife and dragged her back into the house where he held her hostage for hours as other warders and a preacher tried to persuade him to release her and give himself up. Nyawira, from Kirinyaga County, was taken to the Meru Referral and Teaching Hospital from where she was transferred to the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi due to her critical state.
