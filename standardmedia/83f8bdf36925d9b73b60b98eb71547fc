Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs Cabinet Secretary Secily Kariuki has raised concern over the slow repayment of Uwezo loans. Ms Kariuki said the low repayment of Uwezo funds from the beneficiaries was alarming and could work against the purpose of the fund. She said the repayment was lower compared to other revolving funds among them Youth and Women enterprise funds. The CS said many youths in the country still thought that money borrowed from Uwezo Fund is not meant to be paid back. &quot;I want to set the record straight that Uwezo fund is a revolving fund just like the Youth and Women Enterprise funds are. I call on those who have been given the loans to repay them so that others can benefit,&quot; she said. The CS made the remarks at Thika stadium over the weekend when she disbursed cheques worth Sh14.95 million to Youth and Women enterprise beneficiaries of the fund.

She said repayment of Youth Fund loans in Thika constituency was at an impressive 92.5 per cent while that of the Women Enterprise Fund stood at 97 per cent. However, the repayment of Uwezo Fund loans in the constituency stood at 64 per cent. The trend, she said, was the same in other constituencies countrywide. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
