Over 1,300 nurses in Kakamega County will proceed with a strike next Monday following an announcement by their union. &nbsp;Kenya National Union of Nurses Secretary for the Kakamega chapter Renson Bulunya yesterday announced the strike citing grievances which had not been addressed by the county. &ldquo;We are working under an employer that doesn&rsquo;t want dialogue with nurses. Nurses are not promoted but kept on questionable contracts that are frustrating. Suspended nurses are not awarded remittances like house and medical allowances like other cadre employees in the health docket,&rdquo; said Bulunya.
