&nbsp; Mombasa: Likoni residents have been urged to be conscious of their environment and be the champions of their surroundings during the launch of a clean-up exercise at the ferry offices Monday morning. The exercise entailed cleaning the entire areas accessed by ferry commuters both at the island and the mainland. &ldquo;It is important to sensitise all users about the need for a clean environment considering we have currently 300,000 ferry users crossing this channel every day,&rdquo; said Kenya Ferry Services Manging Director Bakari Gowa. The commuters carry a lot of luggage with them, hence you find them leaving some behind and in turn littering both the waiting bays and the vessels. Gowa said the exercise will be a continuous, with at least two similar activities every year.
