Parents have been urged to safeguard this year&#39;s national examinations. Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) chairman George Magoha said the 2016 examinations must be fraud-free and called on parents to participate actively in guarding them. He said the council had made arrangements to secure the papers but challenged parents not to &quot;sit on the fence&quot;. Prof Magoha said each sub-county will have a strong container in which examination papers will be stored briefly before distribution. &quot;We ask parents to take it among themselves to ensure these containers are guarded and that it is not merely a police affair,&quot; he said. He also encouraged parents not to celebrate A grades after release of national examinations if they are ill-gotten.

We rather celebrate a genuine E than celebrate a fraudulent A,&quot; he said. Magoha spoke yesterday after Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i unveiled the new parents&#39; outfit. This marked the end of Musau Ndunda and Nathan Barasa&#39;s unions who have run parallel parents associations factions for years. Onesmus Kimaiyio is the new national chairman of the National Parents Association. Osbon Mabali was elected organising secretary and Orai Adan elected secretary general. The officials were elected yesterday during a national exercise witnessed by Matiang&#39;i.
