MCAs who did not support the impeachment of Governor Nderitu Gachagua have been kicked out of house committees. Majority Leader Duncan Gituanja tabled a notice of motion in which he proposed changes to 19 committees. The move will see the targeted 12 members miss out on sitting allowances they have been enjoying in those committees. &quot;I am proposing the changes to make the committees more effective,&quot; Gituanja said. Some of those affected are Hudson Gicheru (Mukurweini Central), Eva Mukami (Nominated), John Njuguna (Mugunda), Bernard Mubea (Mukurweini West) and Zipporrah Njithi (Nominated). &quot;Some of these members do not attend committee meetings and others are in too many committees and are unable to handle the work involved,&quot; Gituanja said.
