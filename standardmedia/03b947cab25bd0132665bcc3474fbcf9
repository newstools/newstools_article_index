A woman who was sacked for complaining that she was being sexually harassed by her bosses has been awarded Sh1 million by a court. Employment and Labour Relations Court judge Hellen Wasilwa ordered CS Limited to pay the woman who worked as a clerk. The judge noted that she was dismissed after seeking help from the head office concerning the harassment. The court had also fined the company Sh30,000 after finding that its sexual harassment policy statement did not meet the threshold set by Section Six of the Employment Act 2007 and awarded her Sh422,000. The company was willing to settle the case at Sh500,000 but the judge doubled the amount after reviewing the earlier award. &quot;I find this is a proper case for review and I allow the application and review my judgement to include an award of Sh1 million as damages for sexual harassment,&quot; Justice Wasilwa ruled. The woman told the court that various staff members, some of who were managers, constantly harassed her sexually.
