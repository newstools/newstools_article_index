Misappropriating Sh352.9 million is among the accusations levelled against Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua in a motion seeking to impeach him. Mathari/Kiganjo MCA Mutahi Baragu who moved the motion cited nine grounds for removing the county boss, which also includes violation of the Constitution. Mr Baragu, who arrived at the assembly a few minutes past 4pm to a rousing welcome from more than 35 members also accused the governor of failing to perform his duties. &quot;Residents of this county are suffering because the governor has failed to provide leadership,&quot; the MCA said. FINANCIAL YEAR Baragu said Gachagua had failed to explain how Sh352 million was spent. The motion cited the Annual Budget Implementation Status Report for 2015/16 financial year during which the county utilised Sh1.1 billion on development.

However, the county ended up spending only Sh615 million,&quot; he told the House.
