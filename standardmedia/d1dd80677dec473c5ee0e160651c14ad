Two Kisii County MCAs spent a second night in police cells yesterday for allegedly defiling three schoolgirls. The leaders, arrested in Nyamarambe market on Monday, are said to have enticed the girls with money. A policeman attached to Nyamarambe AP Camp said he became suspicious of the occupants of a car coming from Rongo in Migori County. He trailed the car and noticed the students inside changing their clothes. This was just a few metres from their school, Nduru Girls in South Mugirango in Gucha South. The officer alerted his seniors and the school principal and they laid a trap, catching the Form Three students, aged 16 and 17, inside the car. Officers from Nyamarambe Police Station were forced to fire shots in the air to disperse angry residents who threatened to lynch the MCAs.
