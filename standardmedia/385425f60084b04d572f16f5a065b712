The man is said to have slit the throat of the seven-year-old boy with a kitchen knife at Sindo township, Homa Bay County. The fisherman, 30, then attempted to commit suicide after committing the crime at the home of his father-in-law. Police said the woman took her son and left for her parents&rsquo; home. The angry husband later followed but found she had left for an unknown place. He is said to have grabbed the child and slit his throat after he failed to explain his mother&rsquo;s whereabouts. The fisherman then stabbed himself in the stomach as an enraged mob went after him. Villagers rushed him and his son to Sindo Sub-County Hospital but they were referred to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital.
