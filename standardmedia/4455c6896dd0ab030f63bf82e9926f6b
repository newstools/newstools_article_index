&nbsp; MOMBASA: ODM leader Raila Odinga will on Saturday lead his party&rsquo;s governors, MPs and MCAs in celebrations in Mombasa to mark the party&rsquo;s 10th anniversary at which a major declaration is expected. The Orange party has lined up a series of political events at the Coast starting Friday, in what has been described as &quot;a return to the county of its birth&quot;. The events will culminate in a political rally at Tononoka grounds on Saturday. Raila&#39;s allies yesterday billed the event dubbed &quot;10 at 10&quot; as the &quot;mother&quot; of all political rallies held by the Orange party as it prepares to take on President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto in next year&#39;s General Election. The allies said the event would be an extravaganza meant to inspire the hearts and minds of Kenyans.

Yesterday, ODM deputy party leader and Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho said the Opposition would make &quot;a major declaration&quot; that would change the country&#39;s political landscape. But Mr Joho declined to deny or confirm reports that the celebration would culminate in the unveiling of the Opposition&#39;s presidential candidate, saying only, &quot;Wait and see.&quot; He said all ODM elected leaders had been invited to the meetings. Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula are expected at the event as well as some international guests. The Orange party&#39;s Director of Elections and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed said the party would first hold a jamboree to mark its 10 years of existence just a week after the party held a similar event in Nairobi. Mr Mohamed said ODM chose to have the event in Mombasa to prove to Jubilee that the Raila-led party was still the party to beat at the Coast, despite numerous political forays by Uhuru and Ruto last week in the region that overwhelmingly voted for Raila in the last polls.
