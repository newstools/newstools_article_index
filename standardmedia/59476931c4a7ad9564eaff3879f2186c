Jubilee nominated senator Paul Njoroge has vowed to fight an amendment to the elections law that allows party nomination losers to be included in party lists. The legislator argued that the move would lock out minorities and marginalised groups from being nominated, as parties will reward loyalists with seats set aside for the youth, women and persons with disabilities. The Constitution in article 90 (2) states that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) shall be responsible for the conduct and supervision of party nomination and shall ensure that each political party participating in elections nominates and submits a list of all the persons who would stand elected. Njoroge has threatened to raise the issue on the floor of the House when Senate resumes its sittings next week and mobilise support to overturn the amendment, which he described as &#39;selfish.&#39;
