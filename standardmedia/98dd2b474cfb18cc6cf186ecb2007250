Anti-corruption detectives yesterday arrested two Nyeri County officials over Sh4m fraud claims. The arrests come barely a month after three other county officials were found guilty of corruption and fined Sh24 million with an option of serving a three-year jail term. Former County Agriculture Executive Shadrack Mubea and current Chief Officer David Nyaga were picked over the loss of Sh3.9 million through an allegedly flawed tendering process. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) officers said they had been investigating the two over a tender awarded to Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology Enterprises (JKUATES) to conduct audits and review of coffee societies in the county. FINANCIAL FRAUD EACC acting officer in charge of Central region, Faith Ng&rsquo;ethe, said the arrests were a culmination of investigations into financial impropriety said to have taken place in the 2014/15 financial year. After the arrest, the two were briefly remanded at the Nyeri Central Police Station before they were released on a cash bail of Sh20,000 each. Mr Mubea was kicked out of the county executive on April 7, 2015 by Governor Nderitu Gachagua over neglect of duty and inability to provide strategic leadership and management skills needed in the agricultural docket. Mr Nyaga is still serving as the chief officer in the Agriculture and Fisheries docket. Their arrests bring to five the number of county officials charged with corruption. It was not clear if EACC was investigating any other county officials in relation to the fraudulent payments.
