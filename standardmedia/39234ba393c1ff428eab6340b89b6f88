A facility meant to assist accident victims has stalled despite the fact that millions of shillings have already been pumped into it. Retired President Mwai Kibaki commissioned the Sh500 million trauma centre to offer emergency care to victims of road and fire accidents six years ago, when an initial Sh60 million was put in. However, nothing is happening at the site and even the contractor has since left. The facility that was being put up under Mr Kibaki&rsquo;s Ministry of Special Programmes targeted victims of accidents at the notorious Salgaa black spot and Barnabas. The one-storey structure with several rooms has no doors or windows; only the roof and walls are complete. Sources in the Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital&rsquo;s trauma centre said the hospital had so far used millions of shillings on the facility but required more to complete it. BETTER SERVICES &ldquo;The project is still under the control of the national government and there is nothing much we can do about it. I wish the project had been handed to us. We would be able to offer better services to road accident victims who are currently squeezed in our tiny wards,&rdquo; said the source who did not wish to be named for fear of victimisation. But Rift Valley Regional Co-ordinator Wanyama Musiambo said the project must have been handed over to the county by the defunct Transition Authority. &ldquo;All health-related facilities were handed to county governments a long time ago, the trauma centre included. The county is better placed to explain why construction stalled,&rdquo; Mr Musiambo said. Health Executive Kabii Mungai on the other hand accused the national government of failing to clear a Sh90 million debt reportedly owed to the contractor. Dr Mungai said they still needed Sh300 million to complete and equip the facility. He urged the Devolution ministry to intervene and ensure the facility was completed. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
