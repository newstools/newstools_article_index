The national and county&nbsp;governments should collaborate to ensure Early Childhood Development Education is successful, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i has said. The CS noted that lack of co-ordination between the two governments was the reason why there were hitches in ECD learning in some counties. Speaking on Monday, Dr Matiang&#39;i lauded county governments for setting up infrastructure for ECD learning, but said a lot still needs to be done in the sector. &quot;It is not just about setting up structures, we need a uniform policy to guide the sector and at the same time we need to come together and solve the challenges facing ECD education in the country,&quot; said Matiang&#39;i. The CS noted that the country is facing a myriad of challenges in managing ECD education, and urged all stakeholders to come together and work on a formula to improve the sector. &quot;The issues affecting ECD are interrelated in all the counties and as a result, there is need for uniformity in terms of policy,&quot; he added.
