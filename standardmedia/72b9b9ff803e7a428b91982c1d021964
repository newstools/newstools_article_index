&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} London:The struggling pound rose on Wednesday after a brutal sell-off, as British Prime Minister Theresa May&#39;s offer to give lawmakers some scrutiny of the process to leave the European Union calmed market fears of a &quot;hard Brexit&quot;. Those fears - that Britain will give up full access to the EU&#39;s single market in order to impose maximum control on its borders - pushed the currency to 31-year lows last week, including on Friday when it lost 10 percent. May&#39;s decision comes ahead of a court ruling on Thursday, which will decide if she can trigger Article 50 - the rule that initiates the process of separating Britain from the European Union - without the consent of parliament. Many lawmakers seem to favor a &quot;soft Brexit&quot; or no Brexit at all and investors fear the &quot;hard&quot; option could hurt trade and foreign investment needed to fund Britain&#39;s huge current account deficit, one of the biggest in the developed world. Sterling was up 1 percent at $1.2240 GBP=D4, after having tumbled to $1.2086 on Tuesday when it appeared it was heading back towards a 31-year low of $1.1450 hit on Friday. The euro too was down 1 percent at 90.25 pence EURGBP=D4 READ MORE Kenya to rely on colonial treaty to extradite Akashas HOLD YOUR HORSES, SAYS RACHIER Two Kisii MCAs charged with infringing on children rights &quot;After weeks of tough rhetoric pushing sterling into a trading environment closer to an emerging market currency, the government may aim to stabilize markets, with its rhetoric and suggestions now possibly shifting in tone,&quot; Morgan Stanley&#39;s head of currency strategy, Hans Redeker, said. &quot;However, there is a fine line to walk as May&#39;s Conservative Party wants a clean split from Europe. In addition, giving in too much, even before Article 50 negotiations have started, shifts the negotiation advantage towards the EU. Hence, the pound&#39;s rebound should be limited and followed by a decline.&quot; DOLLAR TAKES A BREATHER The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.1 percent to 97.638 .DXY after hitting 97.758 on Tuesday, a post-March peak.
