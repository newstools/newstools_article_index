NAIROBI: All around the world, the youth represent hope and peril. Comparatively, many of the current generation of youth have an easy access to good education, better health and most of all, technology. Consequently, today&rsquo;s youth are outward looking; open-minded, innovative, astute risk-takers and many of them will live longer than their parents. By all means, this abundance of youthful exuberance should inspire hope for a better future. Alas, that is not the case, least of all in Kenya. Many of them feel left behind. The youth are buffeted by unemployment, destitution, and generally, a sad future. To many of them, things could only get worse; thanks to corruption and bad governance. Corruption makes it harder for the youth to climb up the ladder of opportunity. When funds meant for projects that stimulate growth are stolen, they inhibit job opportunities for the youth. Left with little or no options, the youth become cannon fodder for politicians keen to acquire and retain political and state power. It is against this backdrop that State House will host a youth summit today. Commendably, the Jubilee-led Government has rolled out programmes aimed at tapping the youth into the mainstream economy. This out-of the-box thinking has worked elsewhere. We will not be reinventing the wheel. Avoiding the pitfalls that sunk such noble ideas is the start. Actualising sustainable projects is everything.
