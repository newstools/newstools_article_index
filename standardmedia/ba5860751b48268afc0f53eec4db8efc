Residents of Mugundani village in Narok South are crying for help after jigger infestation hit the village. Some of the villagers said jiggers had impaired school-going children&#39;s pupils toes and fingers, making it difficult for them to walk or use their hands. Orkitoi Sankale, whose four children are affected, said despite spraying her house with insecticides and observing cleanliness, the jiggers were still ravaging her family. &quot;Up to now, my children are unable to walk to school as their legs are painful. We really need assistance as we are suffering,&quot; said Ms Sankale. Noonkishu Tompoi, a mother of three, says her two children were affected. &quot;I clean my house every day. I wash my kids but I wonder why they only affect children and not me and my husband,&quot; said Ms Tompoi. The locals have called on public health officials, who have on several occasions assessed their children, to provide assistance to curb more suffering. Narok County Public Health Officer Daniel Sironka blamed the menace on poverty, poor sanitation and lack of clean water for the residents. Speaking during a health stakeholders&#39; meeting held in a hotel in Narok, he said about 10 manyattas are the most affected, adding that the affected families believe they have been bewitched. &quot;Jiggers are mainly associated with uncleanness and dust. When they occur, residents should report to the public health department immediately so that we can fight the menace before it spreads,&quot; he said. The official called on non-governmental institutions dealing with health to collaborate with his office to fight the menace. &quot;We ask our partners to help in buying shoes for all the school-going children in the village affected,&quot; he said.
