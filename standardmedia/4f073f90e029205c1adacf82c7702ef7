The workers umbrella body has claimed that Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) is interfering with the process of recruiting the National Social Security Fund&rsquo;s (NSSF) Managing Trustee. Central Organisation of Trade Union Secretary General Francis&nbsp;Atwoli&nbsp;who represents workers&rsquo; interests at the Fund&rsquo;s board, claimed&nbsp;EACC&nbsp;deputy Secretary Michael Mubea had written to them asking to be furnished with three names of successful applicants for the purpose &ldquo;identifying one for the position.&rdquo; &ldquo;NSSF Act doesn&rsquo;t say the power of appointing CEO lies in the hands of the&nbsp;EACC. Someone has vested interest in workers&rsquo; money,&rdquo; he claimed. Speaking in Nakuru town yesterday,&nbsp;Atwoli&nbsp;said&nbsp;EACC&nbsp;has summoned the board chairman Gideon Ndambuki and acting CEO Anthony Omerikwa under questionable circumstances. He displayed a letter from the commission indicating that Mr Mubea had summoned Ndambuki at Integrity Centre in Nairobi on October 11 to assist with investigation into an alleged abuse of office case in respect to two of his employees. The letter is dated October 5 but&nbsp;Atwoli&nbsp;claims it is part of a scheme to intimidate the new chairman. &ldquo;Ndambuki is just six months in office and he is helping us to recruit a new CEO. Even the acting CEO has been summoned to&nbsp;EACC&nbsp;over issues they do not know,&rdquo; Mr&nbsp;Atwoli&nbsp;said.

It was not intimidation,&rdquo; Marimba said. &ldquo;What Mr Mubea did was to ask to be supplied with details of all the shortlisted applicants for background check before the appointment. It is a requirement under the law,&rdquo; he added.
