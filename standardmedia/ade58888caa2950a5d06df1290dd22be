The referendum campaigns of 2005 which pitted then President Mwai Kibaki against his Roads Minister Raila Odinga led to formation of ODM. Mr Kibaki was supporting the proposed constitution, while Mr Raila was against it. Then Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader, Raila, was in the &quot;No&quot; camp whose symbol was an orange, while Kibaki was in the &quot;Yes&quot; camp represented by a banana. On November 21, at least 58 per cent of Kenyans rejected the proposed constitution handing Raila&#39;s camp victory over Kibaki. The Then Head of State responded by firing all pro-no Cabinet ministers and senior government officials. Apart from Raila, Kibaki sacked Kalonzo Musyoka (now Wiper leader), Ochillo Ayacko, William ole Ntimama, Najib Balala (Now Tourism Cabinet Secretary), Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o (Now Kisumu Senator) and Linah Jebii. Raila&#39;s camp also had the then Opposition leaders Uhuru Kenyatta (now President), William Ruto (now Deputy President) and and Mutula Kilonzo&#39;s backing.

CORD to pick its flag bearer in January But as the leaders were still in a celebratory mood following the victory that was perceived as protest vote against Kibaki&#39;s leadership ahead of the 2007 polls, lawyer Mugambi Imanyara grabbed the opportunity and registered ODM as a political outfit. Raila&#39;s camp was outsmarted and had to scout for a different name which saw them register ODM-Kenya. In a recent interview with The Standard, Mr Imanyara said he was inspired to register the party because of the resounding defeat the banana camp had suffered. &quot;After the no team won, I knew that the orange was going to transform itself into a political movement. I acted fast and registered the party,&quot; he said. Uhuru would later ditch the Orange team in favour of President Kibaki 2007 re-election bandwagon. ODM-Kenya remained with Raila, Kalonzo, Musalia Mudavadi, Ruto, Balala and Joseph Nyagah. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
