A 25-year-old boda boda mechanic in Chevoso village in Malava committed suicide after he disagreed with his wife over proceeds from selling chickens. Simon Lumonje had agreed with his wife, Joyce Lumonje, to sell some of their chickens and use the money to renovate their house. Instead, Lumonje is said to have channelled the cash elsewhere. The couple quarrelled when the wife sought to know how her husband had used the money. The man then threatened to kill himself. Close relatives pleaded with him to abandon thoughts of committing suicide, but he went on and hanged himself after his wife left for the farm.&nbsp; Confirming the incident, Shianda location Chief Alfred Muhatia said the couple had quarrelled in the morning before the incident occurred. He advised married couples to seek counselling from elders, chiefs, church and authorities on how to handle family issues.
