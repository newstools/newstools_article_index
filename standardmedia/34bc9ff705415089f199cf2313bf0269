Ten Kenyans held hostage by Ny&#39;angatom Ethiopian militia have been released. The Christian hostages, among them a Catholic priest, were abducted four days ago by the militia at Kibish border town where they had gone to attend a church service. Kibish Sub-County Commissioner Erick Wanyonyi said the hostages were released on Wednesday after Kenya and Ethiopian authorities intervened. &nbsp;&quot;We had a fruitful discussion with the abductors. They agreed to free the hostages with demand that Turkana herders return their stolen cattle,&quot; Wanyonyi said. He said the abductors claimed cattle rustlers from Turkana community had stolen about 30 head of cattle.
