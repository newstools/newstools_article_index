Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery has warned MPs, Governors Tolgos and Mandago to stop inciting the public against Moi University VC Prof. Laban Ayiro, saying that the political leaders must apologise. This comes a few days after a section of political leaders from the North Rift stormed Moi University main campus with an aim of stopping Prof. Laban Ayiro from taking over as acting Vice Chancellor for the university. In a press statement, Nkaissery said the constitution allows every Kenyan to work in any part of the country whether in public or private sector. The CS said that any political leader who attempts to stop a suitably qualified Kenyan from taking up a job in a public institution because the appointee doesn&rsquo;t come from the region where the institution is domiciled is not only breaking the law but is also going against the letter and spirit of the constitution. &ldquo;In this regard I strongly take exception to the Governor for Uasin Gishu Jackson Mandago, his counterpart from Elgeyo Markwet Alex Tolgos, MPs Oscar Sudi, Silas Tiren and James Bett for the shameful attempts to try to prevent Prof. Laban Ayiro from taking up responsibility as the acting Vice Chancellor for Moi University,&rdquo; Nkaissery said in a statement to media houses. Nkaissery has called upon the National Cohesion and Integration Commission NCIC to demand a public apology from the leaders immediately, failure to which NCIC should have them prosecuted.
