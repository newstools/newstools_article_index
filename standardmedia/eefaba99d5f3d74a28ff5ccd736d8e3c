A couple is being held by police after their seven-month-old boy was sodomised and abandoned in their house. Area County Children&#39;s Director Fred Simi said his officers were alerted by members of the public to a child crying in the house and when they went to check, they found the child naked and frail. &quot;We found the boy with wounds on his buttocks, indicating that the heinous act had been going on for some time,&quot; said Mr Simi. He said the minor seemed to have been left for about four days without food, adding that they took him to Narok County Hospital where after a medical examination, he was found to have been infected with a viral disease. Area OCPD Paul Kiogora said investigations were ongoing. The child will be taken to a children&#39;s home once he is discharged from hospital.
