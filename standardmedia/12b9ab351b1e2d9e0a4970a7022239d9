Justice David Maraga has been sworn in as the new Chief Justice in a ceremony attended by President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi. The new CJ said he will do his best in the fight against corruption to make the Judiciary a successful institution. &quot;Burden of delivery is high on me as Chief Justice, but I aim to succeed. When we allow institutions to thrive, they will do what is right,&quot; Maraga said. President Uhuru asked the newly sworn in Chief Justice to create better relations between the judiciary and other arms of government. The Head of State at the same time reminded Mr Maraga to first clear the over 20,000 cases that are still pending in courts. Maraga who was vetted by a key House committee succeeds retired Chief Justice Willy Mutunga who left office in July this year.
