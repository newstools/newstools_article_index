Attorney General Githu Muigai has accused some judges of issuing injunctions against mega-infrastructural projects. The AG also accused labour courts of interfering with the appointment of parastatal board members and disclosed that the Executive is concerned about the trend. &quot;The injunctions issued against major infrastructure projects without considering the ramifications on the development of the country is a big concern. Such delays are deemed political,&quot; he said. He said there was a need for the Judiciary to assess the impact of such orders, adding that the use of contempt powers against Principal secretaries was also of concern. &quot;Parastatal appointment has become a matter of litigations. Board members always run to the labour court to be reinstated even after new members have been gazetted,&quot; said Muigai. The judges accused the Executive of failing to adhere to court orders. Both sides however agreed there is need to discuss how the issues should be handled.
