A Nairobi court has convicted a businessman charged with conspiracy to kill his partner. Abdulahim Mohammed Shallo conspired with another man to kill Ashok Rupish Shah in 2012 in a property deal gone sour. He was charged with attempting to extort Sh5 million from Shah by threatening him, an offence he committed between July 1 and August 1, 2010, by texting him on his mobile phone and emails. Shallo hurled a petrol bomb at Rupish&#39;s car, an incident he survived though his driver died. Shallo faced 10 counts alongside businessman Hiten Kumar Raja, who was however released due to lack of evidence. Kibera Chief Magistrate Anne Ong&#39;ijo said Shallow will be sentenced on Friday.
