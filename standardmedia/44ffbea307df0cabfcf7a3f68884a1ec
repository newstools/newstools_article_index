Former Minister Nicholas Biwott has warned leaders against politicising the Moi University Vice Chancellor&rsquo;s appointment. Speaking at Sigor in Chepalungu when he presided over a fund-raiser in aid of a women&rsquo;s group at the weekend, Mr Biwott said leaders should keep off management of learning institutions and allow the due process of appointing their leadership to prevail. He said tribalism is rife in most institutions as demonstrated by the Moi University saga. &ldquo;I fail to understand why political leaders would want to interfere with the appointments at Moi University,&rdquo; he said. Also present at the function was Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto.
