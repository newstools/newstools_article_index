Governor Hassan Joho has 21 days to file his defence in a contempt case against him. The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) has sued Mr Joho and two county officials for allegedly tearing down a perimeter wall on a disputed 22 acres against a court order. In 2010, the national broadcaster obtained a temporary injunction in a case in which it sued the defunct Mombasa Municipal Council, accusing it of trespassing. Since then, KBC and the Mombasa County have been locked in a civil dispute over ownership of the property. Last year, the county opposed KBC&rsquo;s plan to build a wall around the disputed plot, prompting the corporation to obtain a court order in May this year allowing it to complete the fencing off of the property. But on September 30, 2016, county askari and hired youths brought down the wall, prompting KBC to sue for contempt.

Lawyers Lucy Momanyi and Paul Butti told Justice Anne Omolo that they were not able to respond to the application filed by KBC because they needed more time to meet their client for a proper brief. Last week, Justice Omolo certified KBC&rsquo;s application as urgent and ordered the two parties to appear before her yesterday. Joho&rsquo;s lawyers said they needed 21 days to enable them to meet the governor and his officers. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
