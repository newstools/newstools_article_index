The Chinese port city of Qinhuangdao was the location for the first test of an innovative new mode of public transport called the Transit Elevated Bus (TEB), a high-riding bus that can glide over gridlocked traffic. The test evaluated the braking system, drag and power consumption, according to tebtech, a company that helped build the TEB. The TEB is designed to help ease traffic congestion. The passenger compartment rises far above other vehicles on the road, allowing cars to pass underneath. The compartment is 22 meters long, 7.8 meters wide and can carry 300 passengers. &nbsp;
