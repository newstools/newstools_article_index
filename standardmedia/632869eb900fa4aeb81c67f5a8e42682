Pressure continues to pile on an Orange Democratic Movement &nbsp;(ODM) Governor who defected to Jubilee Party. A section of Muslim clerics in Kwale County have endorsed Governor Salim Mvurya&#39;s rival to run for the gubernatorial seat in next year&#39;s election. Issah Chipera is expected run on an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party, which Mvurya ditched to join the ruling Jubilee Party. Meeting under the auspices of the National Council of Imams and Scholars (NCIS), the clerics accused Mvurya of failing to consult the electorate before joining Jubilee Party. NCIS chairperson Sheikh Hamisi Banda said the council was surprised by Mvurya&#39;s move to join JP. &quot;As you know, Kwale people had their governor whom they loved but he joined a party that is not liked here, however much it tries to change its colour,&quot; said Banda.
