Ninety per cent of Kenya&rsquo;s 290 constituencies have not revolved a single cent of the multi-billion shilling&nbsp;Uwezo&nbsp;Fundkitty set up by the government in 2014, it has emerged. The revelations, through an&nbsp;Uwezo&nbsp;Fund&nbsp;Oversight Board report, came as Kiharu constituency was ranked as the foremost in terms of absorption and re-taking of the loans meant for youth, women and persons with disability. The concept behind&nbsp;Uwezo&nbsp;was to provide affordable credits using an initial capital of Sh5 billion originally earmarked for re-run of the 2013 presidential poll. The&nbsp;fund&nbsp;grows by revolving the repaid&nbsp;funds&nbsp;within the respective constituencies, as well as through additional government allocations. The finding that 90 per cent of the constituencies (257) have not benefited from the revolved&nbsp;funds&nbsp;means the&nbsp;fund&nbsp;is operating below capacity, although the board does not think so. &ldquo;Thirty three constituencies have revolved Sh111,296,742 from the amounts repaid by beneficiary groups in their respective constituencies. Clearly, this indicates that the&nbsp;fund&nbsp;is achieving its objective of revolving the&nbsp;funds&nbsp;to benefit more groups,&rdquo; the board said in a paid-up advertisement.

Of the seven, six are in northern Kenya&nbsp;&mdash; Banissa, Balambala, Fafi, Wajir North, Lafey and Mandera West. The seventh is Turkana West Constituency. The top-ranked constituency, Kiharu, was allocated Sh18 million as of June 30, but has had a total of Sh30 million loans approved for disbursement over the same period, largely due to successful repayments. Exceeding target From the sum allocated, Kiharu groups have repaid Sh11 million, exceeding the target of Sh8 million set by the board as due by June 2016 by Sh3 million. Consequently, the board has revolved the same Sh11 million in the constituency, the highest in any constituency. A total of 327 groups have benefited from the&nbsp;funds&nbsp;in the constituency. Kiharu MP Irungu Kang&rsquo;ata was all smiles as he shared the secrets of successful uptake and absorption of thefunds&nbsp;in his in the constituency. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
