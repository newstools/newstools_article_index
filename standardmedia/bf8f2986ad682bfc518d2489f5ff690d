More than 500 residents of Malakisi town in Sirisia constituency have been given title deeds. The beneficiaries have lived in the town since independence but did not have titles to the land they occupied. Governor Kenneth Lusaka said the move was aimed at ending land wrangles, which politicians have been using to gain mileage. The county has in the past witnessed land-related conflicts, with the most high profile one involving the Chepyuk Settlement Scheme in Mt Elgon. &ldquo;Since I took over Bungoma as governor, I have been working to ensure that land problems are exhaustively addressed,&rdquo; Mr Lusaka said. He said this was being achieved by increasing the number of land surveyors and registrars to handle different assignments.
