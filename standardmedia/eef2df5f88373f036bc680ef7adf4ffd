Manila: Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday told U.S. President Barack Obama to &quot;go to hell&quot; and said the United States had refused to sell some weapons to his country but he did not care because Russia and China were willing suppliers. In his latest salvo, Duterte said he was realigning his foreign policy because the United States had failed the Philippines and added that at some point, &quot;I will break up with America&quot;. It was not clear what he meant by &quot;break up&quot;. During three tangential and fiercely worded speeches in Manila, Duterte said the United States did not want to sell missiles and other weapons, but Russia and China had told him they could provide them easily. &quot;Although it may sound shit to you, it is my sacred duty to keep the integrity of this republic and the people healthy,&quot; Duterte said. &quot;If you don&#39;t want to sell arms, I&#39;ll go to Russia. I sent the generals to Russia and Russia said &#39;do not worry we have everything you need, we&#39;ll give it to you&#39;. &quot;And as for China, they said &#39;just come over and sign and everything will be delivered&#39;.&quot; READ MORE Philippines' Duterte likens himself to Hitler, wants to kill millions of drug users Vietnam upholds jail terms for political bloggers G20 summit warned of risks to economy as North Korea test-fires missiles His comments were the latest in a near-daily barrage of hostility toward the United States, during which Duterte has started to contrast the former colonial power with its geopolitical rivals Russia and China. On Sunday, he said he had got support from Russia and China when he complained to them about the United States. He also said he would review a U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement. The deal, signed in 2014, grants U.S. troops some access to Philippine bases, and allows them to set up storage facilities for maritime security and humanitarian and disaster response operations. He said the United States should have supported the Philippines in tackling its chronic drugs problems but instead criticized him for the high death toll, as did the European Union. &#39;HELL IS FULL&#39; &quot;Instead of helping us, the first to hit was the State Department. So you can go to hell, Mr Obama, you can go to hell,&quot; he said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
