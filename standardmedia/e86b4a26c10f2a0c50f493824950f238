The woes facing over 30 Opposition MPs who recently defected from various political outfits seem to be far from over. Days after ODM and Ford Kenya threatened to kick out the lawmakers who decamped to join the newly-formed Jubilee Party, an MP now wants the legislators barred from Parliament Buildings. Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma Thursday wrote to&nbsp; National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, saying the leaders should not be allowed into the precincts of Parliament, as they ceased being MPs when they dumped the parties they rode on to get elected. &quot;The former MPs are deemed to have resigned from their political parties and vacated office by provision of Article 103 of the Constitution read together with Section 14 of The Political Parties Act,&quot; reads the letter by Mr Kaluma in part. It adds: &quot;Free access to the precincts of Parliament and facilities reserved for MPs including plenary halls, health club and restaurant by the said former MPs, now strangers, is putting to grave risk the safety, security and privacy of serving MPs.&quot; During the Jubilee Party launch, several MPs from the three major CORD affiliate parties; ODM, Wiper and Ford Kenya, were paraded and it was announced they had bid farewell to the Opposition. MPs from ODM included James Rege (Karachuonyo), Ahmed Abass (Ijara), Gideon Mung&#39;aro (Kilifi North), Zainab Chidzunga (Kilifi County), Mustafa Iddi (Kilifi South), Masoud Mwahima (Likoni), Mpuru Aburi (Tigania East) and Joseph Lekuton (Laisamis). &quot;I request you to keep the said former MPs away from Parliament as per the Parliamentary Standing Orders,&quot; Kaluma pleaded with Speaker Muturi in his letter. If Mr Muturi grants the MP his wishes, other lawmakers from other political vehicles apart from the three major CORD parties, who defected also risk being locked out of the National Assembly. They include Kanu&#39;s Samuel Moroto (Kapenguria), Moses Cheboi (Kuresoi South), Eric Keter (Belgut) and Hellen Sambili (Mogotio) and Narc&#39;s Rachel Nyamai (Kitui South).
