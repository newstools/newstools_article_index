Former Inspector General of police David Kimaiyo becomes the latest former top civil servant to eye an elective post. Mr Kimaiyo announced his intention to vie for the senatorial seat that is currently held by Kipchumba Murkomen, who will be defending his position on a Jubilee Party ticket. Speaking on Sunday at Kapsowar Catholic Church, Kimaiyo said his interest had been propelled by the need to serve, and protect civil servants unfairly haunted out of office.
