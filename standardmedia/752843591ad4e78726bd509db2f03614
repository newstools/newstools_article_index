Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has launched the Maendeleo Chap Chap Movement. Dr Mutua said the movement will focus on promoting socio-economic growth in the country. Addressing the movement&rsquo;s delegates from all 47 counties in Nairobi, Mutua complained of the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;tribal-driven politics&rdquo;. He said his new political outfit&rsquo;s main agenda was to usher in consciousness about leadership and to rescue Kenyans from political slavery that they have been conditioned to. &ldquo;Tribalism is not a way of life but has been institutionalised by our political class to become a reference for our interactions,&rdquo; he told the delegates at Bomas of Kenya yesterday. He went on: &ldquo;Maendeleo Chap Chap is ushering in a new consciousness that says, it does not matter where you were born or what your parents background is, you are first and foremost a Kenyan.&rdquo; The county chief added that the new outfit will have a national outlook.
