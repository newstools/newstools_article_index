Vihiga parliamentarian Yusuf Chanzu has cautioned Governor Moses Akaranga against taking credit for Constituency Development Fund (CDF) projects. &nbsp;Mr Chanzu accused the governor of moving around villages taking credit for the projects. &quot;What projects has the governor initiated? &nbsp;He rushed to open health centres that were constructed by CDF but now have been closed for lack of drugs,&quot; Chanzu said. He hit out at Akaranga whom he accused of lying to residents that the county gets little money compared to others.
