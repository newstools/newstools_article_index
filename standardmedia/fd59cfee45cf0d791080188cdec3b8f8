Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya yesterday held a consultative meeting with ODM legislators and officials to finalise preparations for party leader Raila Odinga&#39;s five-day tour which begins tomorrow. The CORD leader returns to Western barely a month after traversing the region for seven days ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s planned visit slated for mid-September. ODM officials said Raila is expected to hold talks with leaders on how to strengthen the party. &quot;We have come to focus and deliberate about Raila&#39;s visit,&#39;&#39; said Mr Oparanya. Raila was expected in Kakamega two weeks ago, but it was rescheduled due to unavoidable circumstances. He is expected to visit Lugari, Likuyani, Malava, Lurambi, Navakholo, Ikolomani, Butere and Khwisero constituencies, which were not part of his first tour in July. Oparanya said they will take advantage of the tour to popularise the party ideology in a bid to attract and motivate new members into the party fold ahead of next year&#39;s polls. &quot;Raila is also expected to meet aspirants, opinion leaders, clergy, party leaders and delegates and to interact with residents and enlighten them on our manifestos,&quot; he said.
