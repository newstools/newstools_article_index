A fourth year student of Kimathi University in Nyeri County drowned in the crocodile and hippo-infested Sagana River. Denis Kabui, 23, was on a private expedition in the company of 35 other students who had camped at the nearby Thanju Primary School in Kirinyaga County last Friday. Witnesses said the students, who were not familiar with the river, should have engaged the services of area residents to cross the river. According to the university&#39;s public relations department, the expedition had been privately organised by the students. Murang&#39;a Woman Representative Sabina Chege, from whose ward the student came, visited the scene of the accident on Monday and questioned why there were no national or county disaster management teams to attend to such emergencies. A 10-man team of divers from Nairobi also arrived on Monday to search for the body.
