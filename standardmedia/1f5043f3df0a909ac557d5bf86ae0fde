Former Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission (KACC) chairman John Harun Mwau is the latest entrant in the Nairobi gubernatorial race. The Party of Independent Candidates of Kenya (PICK) leader will be among politicians seeking to unseat Governor Evans Kidero in 2017, according to officials of the political outfit. Speaking to journalists on Saturday after a party retreat, PICK Secretary General Justus Amito and Youth Congress Chairman Jasiel Njau said the former Kilome MP has the blessings of the members to go for the county top seat. &ldquo;We are confirming that our party leader John Mwau will run for the Nairobi Governor&#39;s seat. We have spoken to him and he will make the formal announcement next week,&quot; explained Amito. &ldquo;We have all agreed as youths to mobilize support for Mwau. He is an acclaimed businessman with a vast experience in both public service and politics. We endorse him because we know he has the ability to restore Nairobi back to its former glory,&quot; said Njau. The Secretary General explained that the party will not be aligned to either Jubilee or CORD coalitions, adding that it will not field a presidential aspirant in the next general election.
