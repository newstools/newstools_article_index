Kenya&rsquo;s former Foreign Affairs minister, Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula, who is today an opposition senator has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s administration to end the military incursion in Somalia and &ldquo;bring the boys back home.&rdquo; The call echoes that of his CORD co-principals &ndash; ODM&rsquo;s Raila Odinga and Wiper&rsquo;s Kalonzo Musyoka&mdash; who have insisted that securing the borders and Kenya&rsquo;s territorial integrity was more important, now that KDF&rsquo;s mission to cripple al Shabaab has been achieved. Mr Wetang&rsquo;ula, who spoke to The Standard on Sunday, said the mission in Somalia was &ldquo;accomplished&rdquo; and the Kenyan military has to return home and &ldquo;secure our borders&rdquo;. &ldquo;The job was done. Our boys must come back home. You &lsquo;linda nchi&rsquo; (secure the country) by protecting your territorial integrity, not by occupying someone else&rsquo;s territory,&rdquo; said the senator, in the Thursday evening interview at Parliament Buildings in Nairobi. Wetang&rsquo;ula, who is also the Senate Majority Leader, said the withdrawal of troops from Somalia was the official position of CORD. &ldquo;That is our position shared by my brother Raila and my brother Kalonzo,&rdquo; he said.

Not at all, principals vow The chairman of the Defence and Foreign Relations Committee in the National Assembly, Ndung&rsquo;u Gethenji (Tetu) dismissed calls for &ldquo;immediate withdrawal&rdquo; of Kenya&rsquo;s troops from Somalia. Mr Gethenji said the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) had a 2018 deadline, and therefore has to support the security situation of the Mogadishu government to allow it to take over &ldquo;the liberated areas.&rdquo; &ldquo;The military objective was the liberation of Southern Somalia from the border to the sea from Al Shabaab. It was a huge success. Before we went in, there were terror attacks on civilians and military installations, cross-border kidnappings of aid workers, tourists and government officers. Now, those things have been significantly reduced,&rdquo; said Gethenji. Wetang&rsquo;ula&rsquo;s statement is significant because long before the decision was made to storm Somalia, he, together with then Defence Minister Mohammed Yusuf Haji (now Garissa Senator), former military boss Gen (rtd) Jeremiah Kianga and ex-spy chief Michael Gichangi were engaged in talks with world powers and other African countries seeking support for the Somalia operation. Experiences In fact, the Bungoma senator and Haji escaped a car bomb that Al Shabaab had planted on their route during their visit to Mogadishu to get a brief about the operation. This was on October 18, 2011, four days after the &ldquo;go&rdquo; order was given in Nairobi. The meeting was to clarify to the Somalia government that the incursion was not an attack on that country&rsquo;s sovereignty but an operation to &ldquo;crush&rdquo; Al Shabaab, combat terrorism and end piracy on the Indian Ocean coast.
