The&nbsp;Lamu&nbsp;County&nbsp;Government and the National Land Commission are feuding over the allocation of a disputed 12,000-hectare parcel of land to two investors for an energy project. County&nbsp;Secretary Tiyat Osman accused commission chairman Muhammad&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;and Physical Planning Director at the Ministry of Lands Augustine Masinde of favouritism in allocating the land to Kenwind (K) Ltd for preparation of the Port Development Plan (PDP). The&nbsp;county&nbsp;wants the land allocated to Cordisons International (K) Ltd for the same project. In two separate letters addressed to&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;and Masinde and copied to Governor Issa Timamy and Cabinet secretaries Charles Keter (Energy) and Jacob Kaimenyi (Lands), Mr Osman asked the duo to stop meddling in issues outside their scope. Osman accused the two of trying to usurp the powers of the&nbsp;county&nbsp;government. However, Dr&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;fired back at Osman, asking him to stop misleading the public over the eligibility of the two companies. He said Cordisons has local approval but lacks the capacity to handle the project.

This is why the commission revoked titles deeds of ranchers in the Coast region to allow for fair competition. Cordisons has not demonstrated its capacity to handle this project,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This company has been in existence since 2008 and only received approval for expression of interest from the defunct local authority and now the&nbsp;county&nbsp;government, but its officials are hoodwinking Kenyans that they have approvals from the Government for the PDP project.&rdquo; On the other hand,&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;argued, Kenwind came in just one-and-a-half years ago and has already obtained the necessary approvals from the national government. Osman said the land in dispute had been allocated to another investor and the allocation approved by the&nbsp;County&nbsp;Assembly. Correspondence on the same was conveyed to the two, even after the&nbsp;county&nbsp;executive had approved the same for Kenwind and later revoked it. Osman&rsquo;s quarrel with&nbsp;Swazuri&nbsp;is that he does not support Cordisons. Mr Masinde found himself in trouble with Osman for authorising the completion of the PDP by the Kenwind Power Project. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
