Tana Delta contributes Sh213 million annually to the country&#39;s economy, according to a new survey. The money is generated from the major economic activities at the Tana River Basin including fishing, beekeeping, crop and dairy farming as well as pastoralism. Wetlands International Kenya, the NGO that conducted the survey titled &#39;Economics of Ecosystem and Biodiversity Services of the Tana River Basin&#39;, said the report would help conserve the river after highlighting the challenges local residents face. &quot;Kilifi and Tana River counties rely on the river. This study will help them agree on how to equitably share accrued resources,&quot; said Programme Manager Julie Mulonga. The area has an estimated 7.2 million people and Tana River supplies 80 per cent of the water used by Nairobi County&#39;s population of four million. Joakim Harlin from United Nations Environment Programme said the river basin was under threat from soil erosion and human activities including the building of infrastructure.
