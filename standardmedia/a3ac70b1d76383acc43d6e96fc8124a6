Former President Mwai&nbsp;Kibaki&nbsp;was last evening expected to&nbsp;undergo&nbsp;a&nbsp;minor&nbsp;surgery&nbsp;at Netcare Sunninghill Hospital in Johannesburg where he has been admitted. A&nbsp;family&nbsp;source&nbsp;yesterday told The Standard from South Africa that the procedure was to remove a blood clot in one of his veins. By the time of going to press, there was no confirmation whether it had been done or not. However, the&nbsp;source&nbsp;said Mr&nbsp;Kibaki&rsquo;s&nbsp;condition had generally improved and that he was even hosting visitors in hospital ward. When he was first admitted to the&nbsp; hospital, no one, apart from close&nbsp;family&nbsp;members and doctors accompanying him were allowed into his ward. &ldquo;Only some few friends and other relatives have been able to have a conversation with mzee at the hospital. He is very jovial and upbeat,&rdquo; said the&nbsp;source.
