&nbsp; Masinde Muliro University has entered into a partnership with two mission hospitals in Kakamega County to train doctors and nurses. The university&#39;s Vice Chancellor Fredrick Otieno said this will enhance provision of quality medical care in the county. The memorandum of understanding between the university, St Mary&#39;s Mumias Mission Hospital and Mukumu Hospital was signed yesterday in Mumias. Prof Otieno said experts and consultants will be sent to the hospital to oversee treatment of patients. International experts, he said, will be in charge of close to 20 programmes including radiology in the two hospitals. He disclosed that the university will open its doors to the first batch of students for medical courses in September. Otieno noted that the university&#39;s school of medicine will increase access to medical services considering that people have been travelling to as far as Eldoret and Kisumu to get specialised treatment. He was accompanied by professors Egara Kabagi, Charles Chunge, Oloo James and religious leaders who asked stakeholders to embrace the initiative. &quot;We want to change the face of health care in the region by bringing in quality education and nursing of the 21st century,&quot; said Chunge, the dean of the School of Medicine. St Mary&#39;s Hospital Administrator Michael Mugo urged the hospital&#39;s staff to take advantage of the opportunity to pursue further education at the university at subsidised rate.
