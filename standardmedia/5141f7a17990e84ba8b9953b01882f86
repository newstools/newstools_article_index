The fate of Chief Justice nominee David Maraga is now in the hands of Parliament, which resumes Tuesday. State House Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu Sunday&nbsp;confirmed that President Uhuru Kenyatta had submitted Mr Maraga&#39;s name to the House for consideration. &quot;The President received the name last week and has already forwarded it to the National Assembly. He expects Parliament to carefully consider his nomination,&quot; said Mr Esipisu.
