A man yesterday shocked a Nyeri court when he admitted to attempted suicide charge, saying he wanted to join his late father. John Gitahi Ngunjiri told Resident Magistrate Catherine Mburu that his father who died several years ago has been bothering him so much before he decided to ingest poison on September 6, in his home at Karihu Sub-Location, Nyeri when he was rescued by family members. &ldquo;He appears to me everyday when I go to bed, telling me &ldquo;nifuate tukae huku&rdquo; (join me here),&rdquo; revealed Gitahi, who further told the court that he has been sharing his predicament with his family. &ldquo;My wife left immediately after my father&rsquo;s burial and has never returned. The disturbances have gotten worse.&rdquo; He was jailed for three months.
