Kenya Power has restored electricity at the Pan Paper factory ahead of its official re-opening later this month. Electricity had been disconnected due to non-payment of a huge bill. Yesterday, Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka and Bumula MP Boniface Otsiula visited the facility to assess its revival progress. Rai Group of Companies General Manager Chowdary Venkanna is overseeing the revival of the mill after Rai acquired it for Sh900 million. He explained that they expected the factory to start working by the first week of September after its official launch. &ldquo;Now we are working on restoring water so that work starts immediately because we already have raw materials,&rdquo; Mr Venkanna said.
