Donald Trump on Friday called for disarming the bodyguards who protect his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and mused about the consequences of such a move by saying &quot;Let&#39;s see what happens to her.&quot;&nbsp; The Republican presidential nominee was speaking at a rally in Miami, where he contrasted his supporters, who he said back police and want crime reduced, to Clinton, who he derided as someone who &quot;lives behind walls and raises money from hedge funds.&quot; &quot;I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm. I think they should disarm immediately, what do you think, yes?,&quot; he said. &quot;Take their guns away, she doesn&#39;t want guns.
