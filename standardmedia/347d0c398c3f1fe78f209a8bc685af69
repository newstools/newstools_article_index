Five people suffered fractured limbs in Murang&#39;a after a saloon car rammed on them after it lost control at Mukuyu market. The vehicle loaded with onions destined to the market was reported to have lost control after its brakes failed as the driver struggled to join Murang&#39;a-Nairobi highway. Business at the busy market came to stand still as traders abandoned their schedules to take the injured to Murang&#39;a district hospital for treatment. The residents called on the police to order removal of the lorries that have remained parked along the road reserves blaming them for the accident. Peter Kamau a resident said the trucks are a major obstruction to other road users as they block the visibility of the highway. Mukuyu-Kahuro junction, he said has remained a challenge to many of the motorists due to parking of trucks awaiting to be hired to transport building materials. &quot;The accident could have been avoided but the five were unable to escape due to the presence of the trucks in the road reserves,&quot; said Kamau.
