Perhaps taking a cue from Kenyan MPs who are known for demanding all manner of privileges, the Ugandan Parliament has sparked public outrage with its plan to spend UGSh50 million (KSh1.5 million) on funerals of lawmakers. Critics say the move exposes wastage of taxpayer money and the legislature&#39;s sense of entitlement in a poor nation. The allocation comes hot on the heels of a proposal to offer each of Uganda&#39;s 427 lawmakers UGSh150 million (Sh4.5 million) to buy tax-free vehicles, another plan that has drawn strong criticism. The funeral cash will give each lawmaker a state-of-the-art casket, preparation of the grave, police to provide security and food and drinks for mourners. Each funeral will probably last three days, including a period for lying in state. In a country where corruption is widespread, punishment for stealing public funds is rare and politicians are often viewed with cynicism, that strikes citizens as outrageous. Ugandans MPs are not the first ones to demand to be given a &quot;dignified send-off&quot;. In 2013, Kenyan MPs unsuccessfully demanded that they be accorded a state funeral upon death. A Ugandan lawmaker already makes about $5,900 (Sh597,380) a month; the average Ugandan earns around $670 (Sh67,812) a year. &quot;MPs have not told us how they are growing our economy, instead all we see is how they are sucking from it,&quot; Jackie Asiimwe, a women&#39;s rights activist, told Reuters. &quot;The amounts are obscene.&quot; But Chris Obore, the spokesman for parliament, said that public anger against the proposed funeral plans was misplaced, adding that the lawmakers were being &quot;targeted unfairly.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s popular to be seen to be concerned about alleged government wastage,&quot; he said. Under the proposal, five deaths will be budgeted for each financial year. If no lawmaker dies in a given financial year, money will be returned to the Treasury, Obore said. A procurement process for a funeral provider is under way. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
