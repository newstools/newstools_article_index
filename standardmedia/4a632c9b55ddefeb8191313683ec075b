Sexual offences are on the rise. Most of these cases involve minors, either as victims or perpetrators of the crime. Many have been the times that underage boys have been arrested in relation to sexual offences. While deterrent punishment is necessary to bring offenders to their senses, there are inconsistencies in law, particularly the Sexual Offences Act that sometimes don&rsquo;t allow judges to mete out sentences commensurate with the crime. While the commission of a sexual offence or rape does not necessarily vary according to the age of the victim, the Sexual Offences Act prescribes different punishment based on the age of the victim. The age at which one is recognised as an adult has seen only boys below the majority age serve jail terms for sexual offences committed on a consensual basis. There is therefore urgent need for a rethink of the Sexual Offences Act. The laws should be reviewed to allow them serve the purpose which they were originally intended to serve; that of protecting minors and women from sexual molesters. The law should be reviewed to give judges leeway in determining deterrent sentences based on the gravity of the crime rather than on the age and gender of the victim.
