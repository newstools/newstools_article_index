Residents of Giika location in Igembe South sub-county last weekend feted their first ever girl to go to university. Local administrators, parents, school children and elders were among those who turned up to celebrate Nanis Wanja&#39;s achievement. The 21-year-old former student at Tiira Day Secondary School got a mean score B Plain, and will join the Maasai Mara University to pursue a Bachelor of Education (English/Literature) degree course. The residents, led by Elijah Kimathi, the school&#39;s board of management chairman, also helped raise Ms Wanja&#39;s fees. The jovial Wanja attributed her success to God and her mentors; Rev Henry Gitonga and Mr Kimathi who is also Governor Peter Munya&#39;s personal assistant. &quot;It is a dream come true for me to join university. I want to pursue a bachelor&#39;s degree, then master&#39;s and a PhD,&quot; she said. Wanja had to trek a long distance to and from school because there are no vehicles on the route. &quot;But even if there were, she would not have been able to afford it because her parents are peasant farmers. She has exhibited qualities of someone who was determined to achieve in spite of the odds stacked against her, and made the entire community proud,&quot; said Mr Kimathi. Attending a day secondary school and coming from a far-flung area bordering the arid Tharaka Nithi County where female genital mutilation is rife, and had led to high drop-out rates among girls, Wanja&#39;s was no mean feat. Education is not highly emphasised in the area, with many girls forced to drop out and into early marriages. &quot;I had set myself a target of attaining university grades. I concentrated hard and had little time to play and other time-wasting activities. I had to go to university because I want to help in improving my family&#39;s lifestyle and that of the community,&quot; Wanja, the fourth-born in a family of 10, said. Her younger brother will also be joining Machakos University. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
