Lord Delamere&rsquo;s heir Thomas (Tom) Patrick Gilbert Cholmondeley has died. Cholmondeley passed on at the MP Shah Hospital, Nairobi this afternoon following a heart failure. The hospital&rsquo;s chief executive Dr Anup Das has confirmed the death saying he had been admitted there on Tuesday for a medical procedure. &ldquo;It is true he was admitted for a medical procedure on Tuesday but died out of cardiac arrest this afternoon ,&rdquo; said Das. He had been operated on and admitted to the ICU. Doctors at the hospital said he was admitted there as a private patient. Mr Cholmondeley who was born in June 19, 1968 was apparently rushed there on Tuesday with pain on his hip that needed a replacement. His friends and relatives thronged the hospital following news of the death. Mr Cholmondeley was the son of the 5th Lord Delamere, a scion of Kenya&rsquo;s British settler aristocracy. He stayed in Naivasha and Nairobi. In April 2005, Mr Cholmondeley shot dead Robert Njoya, a stonemason, at his Soysambu ranch over claims of intrusion.
