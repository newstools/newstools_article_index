Nyando MP Fred Outa has been arrested in connection with student riots at a local secondary school. Mr Outa was accused of inciting the students of Ahero Girls Secondary School to violence after their principal, Sarah Odipo, was interdicted. The MP was taken to court in Kisumu where a magistrate denied him bail. The prosecution had asked court to order the MP&#39;s detention for three days as they completed investigations. The police are investigating accusations of incitement, malicious damage to property and causing a disturbance. Chief Magistrate Julius Ng&#39;ang&#39;a directed the MP&#39;s detention until this morning, when he will make a ruling on the prosecution&#39;s request.
