Former Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Mwangi Thuita has stirred political waters in Laikipia County by declaring his intention to vie for the governor&#39;s seat.&nbsp; Thuita announced his political debut last week, citing his vast experience in&nbsp; public administration. He served in senior positions in the Government for over 20 years. He is expected to run on a Jubilee Party ticket, further complicating the political equation of the county&#39;s gubernatorial race. Political pundits say the entry of the former PS in the governorship race is a game changer. Thuita joins a growing crowd of candidates, including the incumbent&nbsp; governor, Joshua Irungu, his deputy Gitonga Kabugi, former industrialisation assistant minister Ndiritu Muriithi, former county secretary, John Mwaniki and businessman Mburu Kamau.
