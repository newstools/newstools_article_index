A family wants local police officers alleged to have tortured their kin to death arrested and prosecuted. David Otwane reportedly succumbed to injuries inflicted by officers at Kachibora Police Station last month after he was arrested over alleged involvement in crime. Otwane, who lived at Toboto village in Kweny District, Eastern Uganda, was arrested alongside his brother Daniel Juma in Chepkoyo village while attending their cousin&rsquo;s funeral. According to family members, Otwane had arrived on July 3, 2016, to attend the burial of his cousin Joshua Cheruiyot when officers arrested him at night. &ldquo;It was around 11pm when we heard knocks on the door and people who identified themselves as police officers ordered us to open. Then they attacked us, claiming we are criminals,&rdquo; Juma told The Standard. The officers allegedly used some lessos that were in the house to gag Otwane and Juma to stop them from screaming.
