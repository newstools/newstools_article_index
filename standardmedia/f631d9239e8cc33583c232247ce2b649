A police officer who allegedly robbed Tharaka Nithi Deputy Governor Eliud Mate of Sh3.5 million at gunpoint on Wednesday was not arraigned in court on Thursday. Journalists who camped at the Meru courts for hours to cover his appearance were informed that Josphat Kibiegon, an Administration Police constable, had to leave the court premises after it became clear he would not be taking a plea. The constable, however, was briefly taken to Meru Police Station and then whisked away to an unknown destination. Yesterday, Imenti North OCPD Sam Kosgei said investigations were still on-going and Kibiegon is now expected to be taken to court on Monday. &ldquo;We arrested him yesterday (Thursday) morning and investigations are still on,&rdquo; said Mr Kosgei. The officer, based at the Marimanti AP Camp in Tharaka Nithi, had accompanied the deputy governor from Kathwana to Dr Mate&rsquo;s home in Kinoru area, Meru. It is alleged upon arrival in Mate&rsquo;s compound the officer grabbed the bag containing the money that Mate says was proceeds from sale of a piece of land at Kathwana. The OCPD said the constable, who was armed pointed the weapon at the deputy governor who, together with a guard at the compound, Mate&rsquo;s driver and a civilian, took off for their safety.
