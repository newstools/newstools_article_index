NAIROBI: An estimated 150 million eyeballs saw the wonderment in Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s gaze as he sampled Kenya&rsquo;s beautiful nature in Naivasha last week. The assumption is that Mr Zuckerberg&rsquo;s (the founder of Facebook) 78 million followers looked at and shared the pictures showing him atop a tour van with his wife Priscilla Chan and three friends gazing at giraffes and gazelles at the Lake Naivasha National Park. A picture of the billionaire dipping his hands into a meal of fish and ugali at Mama Oliech lit up the social media. And last week, guests who had come for the TICAD VI conference flocked to the Masai Mara to witness the World&rsquo;s 8th Wonder. Away from the cacophony of the toxic politics and the selfish exploits of a few, there is a lot that Kenya can offer to the world. Its people, (hospitable, good-natured, hard-working, resilient and resourceful) remain its greatest asset. Just last month, our world-beating athletes did it again at the Rio 2016 Olympics, coming second in Athletics and the first in Africa with six gold, six silver and 1 bronze medals. That is at odds with the brand of back-stabbing, opportunistic politics we witness. So while the politicians may outdo each other exposing what is bad about us, Kenya remains beautiful.&nbsp; READ MORE Kenya stamps authority in schools' athletics Malava reclaim volleyball title Stop stealing at port, President Uhuru warns employees
