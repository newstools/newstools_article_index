Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) Director General has visited Embu to assess the progress of a Sh2.2 billion water project funded by the organisation. Mr Kunihilo Yamauchu led a team of JICA officials in inspecting the project at Mwiria, which has been expanded to improve water intake. He also toured the water treatment plant at Mukangu in Manyatta sub-county. Once completed the project, which started six years ago, will benefit over 200,000 residents. Residents of the semi-arid Mbeere will be the biggest beneficiaries of the project. The JICA grant is channelled through Embu Water and Sanitation Company, a semi-autonomous entity under the county government. Governor Martin Wambora said the project, one of the biggest in the region, will boost provision of clean drinking water to the residents.
