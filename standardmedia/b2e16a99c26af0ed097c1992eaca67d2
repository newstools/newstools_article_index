Bungoma MCAs have suspended next week&#39;s sessions to participate in inter-assemblies games. The members and county staff will head to Kiambu County to join the rest of the assemblies for the fourth edition of the Casa games that kick off on Sunday. The week-long sporting festival will bring together teams from assemblies across the country. Teams in various disciplines including football, volleyball, netball, tug-of-war, table tennis, badminton, Ajua, and athletics will represent the county. Assembly Speaker John Makali Thursday urged the teams representing the county to put their best foot forward and emerge victorious. &quot;You need to compete and win trophies to make our county and assembly proud. I wish all the teams well,&quot; said Mr Makali. The Speaker urged the teams to ensure high standards of discipline and safeguard the reputation of county Assembly. &quot;We need to ensure the reputation of our assembly is protected. We need to play and conduct ourselves with decorum and dignity,&quot; he said. Last year, the assembly won trophies in tug-of-war and netball.
