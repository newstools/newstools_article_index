Kenya has dismissed charges that it did not co-operate with UN-backed court during the trial of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Foreign Affairs Cabinet Amina Mohammed said Kenya never interfered with the International Criminal Court (ICC) process during the case, which has since been terminated by the court, which sits in The Hague. &quot;Kenya co-operated fully and in good faith... and we expect the court and the Assembly of States Parties to listen to us. The court wants Assembly of State Parties to talk to Kenya about this matter. This is different from Kenya being reported to ASP,&quot; said the CS, arguing media reports about Kenya&#39;s censure were not accurate. She continued: &quot;We have made it clear, as a country we have never interfered with the court&#39;s process. I have had a chat with ASP President Ambassador Bruno Stagno twice on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly meeting and his position is very different.&quot; On Monday, Trial Chamber V(B) of the ICC issued a decision finding that Kenya had failed to co-operate with the ICC.
