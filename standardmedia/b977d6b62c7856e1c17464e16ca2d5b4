A man drowned in a dam&nbsp;in what police say could have been a case of suicide. The man was last spotted at the dam-which is situated along Nyeri-Karatina highway- on Tuesday evening. &nbsp;Mathira West OCPD Mr David Kemboi said the man was spotted along the dam&#39;s banks, and that he stripped and plunged into the dam leaving his clothes behind. &nbsp;He said the man&#39;s actions before jumping into the dam indicated that he may have committed suicide.
