Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i has ordered a probe into allegations of student battery in Nyabururu Girls National School. This follows complaints by parents whose daughters are nursing serious injuries allegedly inflicted by a group dubbed &lsquo;massacre teachers&rsquo; by students. Nyanza Regional Education Co-ordinator Richard Chepkawai Wednesday confirmed he had received instructions from the CS to interrogate school principal Emelda Ochenge and other stakeholders, and give a report on the situation. Ms Ochenge declined to respond to our questions about the allegations. &ldquo;I am headed for Kisii now to interrogate the situation, but my officers on the ground are already in the school to start piecing together information,&rdquo; said Mr Chepkawai in an interview with The Standard in his Kisumu office.

The latest incident involved a Form One student who is nursing injuries on her upper right arm allegedly inflicted by a teacher who beat her using a computer cable. The student&rsquo;s father, Enock Kerama, said he travelled from Nairobi to the school to verify his daughter&rsquo;s condition after he was tipped off about the incident by a school worker. According to Mr Kerama, a worker in the school phoned him after seeing the wound on the girl&rsquo;s arm four days after the beating. But when he tried to reach the school administration to get clarification on the incident, his phone calls went unanswered, forcing him to travel to the school. &ldquo;I was denied entry into the school and told to go back home despite the fact that the girl had not been taken to hospital,&rdquo; he said.
