Reiterating his desire to vie for the ticket in the Coalition&rsquo;s primaries, Raila said he is ready to support whoever will emerge the winner in that primary contest. He therefore asked CORD supporters to ignore reports in a section of the local media (not The Standard) that he has to be the CORD candidate.
