Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has urged ODM leader Raila Odinga to crack the whip on those causing political mayhem in Siaya County. Speaking in Ukwala in Ugenya sub-county, Mr Wandayi said infighting within the party could derail the Opposition leader&#39;s State House bid in next year&#39;s polls. &quot;Our top agenda as leaders of this county should be to ensure that you become president above everything else,&quot; he told the ODM leader who was present at the meeting.
