A man was stabbed to death by his wife during a domestic quarrel in Maragua town on Sunday night. Peter Ndung&#39;u Njoroge, 38, was allegedly stabbed several times in the chest by his wife after he demanded that she returns his Sh19,000 during the 9pm quarrel. Neighbours said the couple often had domestic differences that culminated in physical fights, especially when they were drunk. On the fateful night, the assailant is said to have picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed her husband after he insisted on getting his money back. The suspect was arrested by police officers who saved her from the wrath of neighbours intent on lynching her. Mr Njoroge&#39;s body was found lying in a pool of blood in the house.
