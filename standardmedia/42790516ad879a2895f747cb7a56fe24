Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet has been directed to order the arrest of three police officers due to misconduct. The officers, Agnes Mwendwa Magiri, Sarah Wachira and Brian Ochieng Onyango, have had charges preferred against them by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). This is on recommendation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa), which also recommended murder charges against another officer, Hillary Nyatodo Oyugi, for allegedly shooting dead one Julius Karanja Mwangi. The shooting of Mr Mwangi reportedly took place at his home in Murang&#39;a County on November 2, 2014. DPP Keriako Tobiko is said to have concurred with the Ipoa recommendations on Ms Magiri and Ms Wachira to face charges of subjecting a minor to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The two officers were linked to an incident that saw a then Form Four girl student from Kanyama Secondary stripped naked at Kiangwaci Police Patrol Base during a strip search where bhang was found.
