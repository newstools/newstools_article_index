He said they have set aside 1.9 billion in the current financial year to finance water projects. &quot;Part of the money will be used to support required infrastructure for provision of water in villages throughout the county,&quot; Luka said yesterday. He added: &quot;We are drilling more boreholes and building dams that will be used in harvesting water. This will ensure as many people as possible are connected to water supply.&quot; However, Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala attributed the biting water shortage to poor planning by the county government.
