The world&#39;s oldest man has been identified as Indonesian Mbah Gotho, 145, with documentation showing he was born in 1870. Mr Gotho said he began preparing for his death in 1992, even having a gravestone made, but 24 years later he is still alive. He has now outlived all 10 of his siblings, his four wives and his children. Though his age is impressive, Gotho told a regional news network that &quot;what I want is to die.&quot; For the past three months, he has been bathed and spoon-fed, and is becoming increasingly frail. Gotho has official documentation which shows his age, and the Indonesian records office says it has confirmed his birth date as December 31, 1870. If this is correct, this would earn him the title of the oldest person ever, a status that was held by French golden ager Jeanne Calment who was 122 when she died, 23 years younger than Gotho. If the documents cannot be independently verified, however, Gotho will not go down in the record books. There are a number of people who claim to have broken Jeanne Calment&#39;s record, such as Nigerian James Olofintuyi, who claims to be 171, and Dhaqabo Ebba from Ethiopia, who claims to be 163. But without verifiable documents, they cannot be given the title. Gotho, the antediluvian from Central Java, says he spends his time listening to the radio, as his eyesight was no longer good enough to watch television. When asked the secret to a long life, he said: &quot;The recipe is just patience.&quot; And 126-year-old Selina Mmbone Mbasu could be the oldest person alive in Kenya. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
