The government plans to stop the establishment of&nbsp;new&nbsp;schools&nbsp;to first fully develop and equip the existing ones. Deputy President William Ruto said there was no need of starting&nbsp;more&nbsp;new&nbsp;schools, while many of the current ones lacked requisite facilities. &ldquo;Instead of starting&nbsp;new&nbsp;schools, the government will support the infrastructure of the existing ones to make learning conducive,&rdquo; he said at Mary Hill Girls High&nbsp;School, Thika, during a fundraiser for the&nbsp;school. The DP added: &ldquo;The government will provide additional resources to oversee the expansion of&nbsp;schools.&rdquo; Ruto said additional infrastructure in current&nbsp;schools&nbsp;will ensure many&nbsp;more&nbsp;students are accommodated. He said the Jubilee government was committed to making education affordable and accessible to all. The DP added that the government had increased finance capitation of students in both primary and secondary&nbsp;schools&nbsp;from 30 to 40 per cent in the last three years.
