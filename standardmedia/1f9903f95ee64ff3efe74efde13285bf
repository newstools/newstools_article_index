Gatundu ultra-modern market will become a 24-hour facility after Kiambu county government approved a proposal by area MP Moses Kuria to give it that ambitious status. &ldquo;This will be historic. Gatundu modern market is officially the first 24-hour trading centre in Kenya and this will help uplift the local economy,&rdquo; said Mr Kuria. He challenged locals and non-locals to take advantage of the new status of the market and do business. The market&rsquo;s chairman Michael Kimani said customers were undergoing many challenges before. The market which was built by the government at a cost of Sh312 million was opened in 2013 by Deputy President William Ruto. It has a capacity of more than 500 traders in the stalls, and an additional 100 in the open air space. The traders in the market last year formed a Sacco which now has a capital base of Sh4 million.
