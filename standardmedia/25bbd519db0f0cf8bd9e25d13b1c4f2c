An Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)&nbsp;MP&nbsp;has&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;administration is planning to rig next year&rsquo;s General Elections. Suna East&nbsp;MP&nbsp;Junet Mohammed&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;the ruling party plans to achieve this goal through a &lsquo;suspect&rsquo; voter registration. In a statement, Mohammed accused the Ministry of Interior of being behind the scheme. The ministry reportedly sent a memo to church leaders and youth groups notifying them of a planned mobile ID cards and voter-registration exercise. Mohammed said the Ministry&rsquo;s decision to issue the memo and the contents thereof, appear to usurp the functions of Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission (IEBC) that undertakes mass voter registration. &ldquo;The collusion between Ministry of Interior and IEBC to concentrate on mass registration of voters in&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;regions, particularly Central is part of the early rigging by the government, which&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;will not allow,&rdquo; Mohammed said.

Njoka said the process of issuance of identity cards is a civic duty that the State is obligated to fulfill. &ldquo;This memo is from an administrator trying to push for the issuance of IDs. With half a million uncollected cards in the country, we are sensitising the public through chiefs, district officers and others to use the available avenues to rally Kenyans of the eligible age to apply. &quot;This is happening in all regions. We have visited Migori, Kisii and Kisumu where the Interior Principal Secretary Kibicho Karanja asked Kenyans to apply for IDs,&rdquo; Njoka said and challenged Mohammed to produce evidence. &ldquo;Registration bureaus are all over the country. We would be happy to see the figures. The IDs will help Kenyans to secure jobs and join the military or police force. If they want to vote, it&rsquo;s their right as enshrined in law.&quot; Mohammed said the&nbsp;ODM&nbsp;leadership had noted that only&nbsp;Jubilee-allied&nbsp;areas are getting &lsquo;this kind of government attention&rsquo; and massive employment of resources.
