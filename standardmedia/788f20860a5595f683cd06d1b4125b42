Opposition leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka met to calm fears that their rivalry over the CORD presidential ticket was tearing the coalition apart and to also assure supporters that they were still standing together. The midday meeting at Raila&rsquo;s Capitol Hill office came hot on the heels of heated exchanges among the coalition&rsquo;s three co-principals on the formula for picking the flag-bearer. The other bone of contention was whether the ODM leader shouldn&rsquo;t step down for either Kalonzo or Ford-Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. Supporters of Raila, Kalonzo and Wetang&rsquo;ula have all insisted their respective party leaders are best suited to fly the coalition&rsquo;s flag in coming polls, putting CORD affiliate parties at loggerheads. A source at Raila&rsquo;s office said the two leaders talked for close to three hours. Kalonzo has repeatedly said he has sacrificed for other leaders in the past, insisting it was time for Raila to reciprocate by backing his bid for State House.
