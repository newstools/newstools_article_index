Some retired teachers are set&nbsp;to receive up to Sh1million each&nbsp;in pension arrears as the State&nbsp;moves to end a 19-year pay dispute. The Pensions Department&nbsp;has started processing Sh1.5&nbsp;billion, which is part payment&nbsp;of Sh16.4 billion owed to 32,000&nbsp;retired tutors. This comes after&nbsp;the Government lost all court battles to block the pension arrears, which have subjected thousands of retired teachers to almost two decades of abject poverty. The Pensions Department said it had received Sh1.5 billion from the National Treasury to jump-start the payment plan, which will be implemented in phases. &quot;We have started paying and I am already processing the first 400 cases. There are some who are getting as high as one million shillings,&quot; Director of Pensions Shem Nyakutu told&nbsp;The Standard. Nyakutu, who was recently arraigned to answer contempt charges over the delays in payment, said about 32,000 former tutors will benefit from the enhanced pension instalments. The Standard&nbsp;saw some of the files that had been brought for final signatures by Mr Nyakutu.
