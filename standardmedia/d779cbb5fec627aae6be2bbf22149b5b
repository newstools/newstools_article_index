&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} Bern:If Republican candidate Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, it would be &quot;dangerous from an international point of view&quot;, the top United Nations human rights official said on Wednesday. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra&#39;ad al Hussein cited Trump&#39;s views on vulnerable communities and his talk of using torture, banned under international law, as &quot;deeply unsettling and disturbing&quot;. &quot;If Donald Trump is elected on the basis of what he has said already - and unless that changes - I think it is without a doubt that he would be dangerous from an international point of view,&quot; Zeid told a news briefing in Geneva.
