ODM party leader Raila Odinga, Wiper Democratic Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula accused the media of fanning the debate on disunity. Speaking yesterday during the burial of Prince Henry Dolamu, husband to Wavinya Ndeti, at Kenanie farm in Mavoko, the three leaders said they are firmly together. &ldquo;We did not come here for politics. We came for a burial. But you can see Kalonzo is here, Wetang&#39;ula is here and myself. We are together. It is the media spreading rumours that CORD will split,&rdquo; said Raila. He termed reports that Kalonzo and Wetang&rsquo;ula will break from the coalition as rumours. &ldquo;They say Wetang&rsquo;ula will leave, that Kalonzo will also go and that Raila will go it alone. All these are rumours,&rdquo; said Raila. He asked the media to investigate and report accurately on CORD matters.
