The woman is accused of having inserted an object into the private parts of her eight-year-old daughter on July 22 this year at Crater Academy in Milimani Estate, Nakuru.

Prosecutor Hillary Songoyo told the court that the woman was a flight risk and should be detained, noting she had escaped from police custody before.
