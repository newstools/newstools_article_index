&nbsp; A spectacular air show scheduled for Saturday will mark 101 years since the first aircraft flew in East Africa. The first flight happened on August 8, 1915, when a British-assembled aircraft took off from Maktau in Taita Taveta County. The aircraft played a major role in the British military campaign against Germans in World War I. Then, Taita Taveta was an epicenter of the most brutal battles between German and British forces. To date, there are still trenches, remnants of World War I artillery and mass graves in Voi, Taveta, Buras, Salaita and Maktau.
