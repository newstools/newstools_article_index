Two MPs want the National and Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) to start buying maize from farmers. Saboti MP David Lazaro and Woman Representative Janet Nangabo said crop was ready for harvesting and any delay in the opening of the board&#39;s depots would expose farmers to exploitation by middlemen. The MPs said they were alarmed by the presence of huge consignments of cheap maize imports from Uganda, and asked the Government to ensure the imports did not reach NCPB depots. &quot;The Government must protect farmers from exploitation by opening the board to enable farmers to deliver their crop,&quot; Mr Lazaro said. Speaking in Kitale, the MPs also asked the Government to offer better prices, saying the current price of Sh2,300 was too low. They supported demands by farmers that the Government should buy maize at Sh3,500 for a 90kg bag to cushion them from high production costs. &quot;Farmers should been encouraged by the Government though incentives and better prices to produce more food,&quot; Ms Nangabo added. RAW DEAL Last week, farmers complained that the Government had given them a raw deal despite their contribution to the county&#39;s economy. &quot;As farmers, we have contributed a lot for the country but our major challenge is poor pricing for the maize we deliver to NCPB. We want better prices to keep us in business,&quot; he said. Farmers said it was discouraging that the Government was reluctant to increase prices in a bid to promote agribusiness. They felt they had been abandoned by the Government and exposed to exploitation. &quot;For many years we have not been getting value for our money and hard work. We feel abandoned by the Government and want them to listen to our problems,&quot; argued Job Tallam, a farmer. They explained that the high cost of farm inputs was hindering productivity. It costs a farmer over Sh2,000 to produce a 90kg of maize. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
