The county government is set to host a major conference later this month to showcase investment opportunities. Speaking in Bungoma town yesterday, Governor Ken Lusaka said the business summit would provide a crucial platform for both local and international businesses to network. Mr Lusaka said over 10 governors would attend the investment conference, which will be opened by Deputy President William Ruto. &quot;It will bring a wealth of distinguished opinion leaders and influential investors to Bungoma, Kenya&#39;s premier agricultural centre,&quot; he said. The governor said the international meeting would underscore the increasing economic dynamism of devolved units, and Bungoma County in particular. &quot;There is a new geography of trade and investment. Counties in Kenya are driving this new trend,&quot; he said.

This is likely to continue given the steady pace at which devolved units are growing,&quot; said Mr Chongwony. In the last three years, Bungoma County has seen significant transformation, ranging from the modernisation of roads and expanded power connections. These factors, analysts say, have increased investment inflows into Western region.
