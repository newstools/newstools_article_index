Tullow Oil has announced that it would return to Baringo County where its suspended operations after locals turned hostile. It stopped prospecting for oil in March over what villagers claimed was exclusion by the British-owned exploration firm. Edward Mungatana, a senior manager at Tullow, told a public forum yesterday that his company was willing to go back to resume the exploration, and that it cannot afford to be irresponsible in its activities. &quot;We are willing to go back and revisit the grievances brought by the villagers,&quot; Mr Mungatana said. &quot;Any complaints should be directed back to us because we have put in place a mechanism to listen to them,&quot; he added. drilling well READ MORE Uganda gives Tullow Oil, Total production licences Bill seeks to ensure that minerals benefit locals How Kenya can avoid oil curse Tullow reportedly spends about Sh100 million in drilling a single oil well.
