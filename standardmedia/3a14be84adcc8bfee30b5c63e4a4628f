A six-year-old girl is admitted in hospital after she was allegedly defiled on her way from school. The minor, a pupil at an Early Childhood Development centre, is said to have been walking home alone when she was attacked by her 20-year-old neighbour, leaving her with serious injuries to her private parts. Angry villagers flushed the suspect from his parents&#39; home and handed him over to the police as leaders condemned the incident and demanded justice. The child is scheduled to have surgery.
