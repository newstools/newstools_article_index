MPs want political analyst Mutahi Ngunyi compelled to refund excess money paid to his company a year ago by the National Youth Service (NYS), plus interest accrued over the period. National Assembly Public Accounts Committee Chairman Nicholas Gumbo directed Public Service and Youth Affairs Ministry to ensure that Mr Ngunyi refunds Sh12.5 million that was paid irregularly to his firm, plus interest. Ngunyi&#39;s Consulting House Limited is among companies identified to have received questionable payments amounting to millions of shillings from NYS, when the body was under the Ministry of Devolution. Yesterday, Public Service Permanent Secretary Lilian Omollo while appearing before the watchdog committee told the MPs that Ngunyi has not yet refunded the money, even after he offered to do so promptly in July. &quot;We have written a letter to the company to refund the money but they have not yet responded,&quot; said the PS, who was accompanied by NYS Director General Richard Ndubai, among other officials. &quot;It is not that simple. You cannot keep someone&#39;s money, in this case public money for over a year and repay without interest. Even a bank loan accrues interest,&quot; said Mr Gumbo, adding that the ministry should come up with a framework to calculate how much the company should repay.
