Governor Mwangi wa Iria who is seeking another term says he has the management skills to spur development. The governor said many of the programmes introduced in the past three years have transformed the lives of the locals socially and economically. Speaking at Kiria-ini market in Mathioya, he pleaded with the locals to support his second term bid. He told off his critics led by Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau, saying they had failed to initiate meaningful strategies to help the county. &ldquo;Sustainability of agriculture-based projects will depend on the residents support for my re-election. My opponents could sabotage them,&rdquo; said Iria.&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Boniface Gikandi READ MORE Officials suspended for delayed road projects Fears of vacuum as experienced MPs scramble for governorship around Kenya Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau steps up battle with Governor Iria ahead of elections
