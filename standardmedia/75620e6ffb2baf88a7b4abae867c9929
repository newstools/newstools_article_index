Efforts by the county government to force doctors to resume work failed after the court declined to outlaw the strike. In an application through lawyer Harry Gakinya on Friday, the county government wanted the court to declare the strike illegal and order doctors to return to work. However, Justice Stephen Radido of the Employment and Labour Relations Court declined to issue the conservatory orders. Instead, he directed the government to serve the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union with the application pending an inter-parties hearing tomorrow. Noting it is a matter between life and death, the judge said he could not issue an injunction when it comes to issues of non-payment. The doctors who have been on strike since September 16, had issued a notice on September 9 when they threatened to boycott work unless their demands were met. They are demanding salaries and arrears from April 2016. The doctors&rsquo; union is also demanding promotion of their members.

The county says the doctors who are demanding salaries from April are insincere because they had been working as interns until July when they were employed. NO OBLIGATION The lawyer told the court that the county government had no obligation to pay for work not done. In the application, Gakinya claimed the strike was premature, non-procedural and unreasonable. He further argued the demand for car, loans and mortgages could not be resolved in seven days citing budgetary limitations. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
