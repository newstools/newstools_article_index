American pop star Chris Brown landed in Mombasa yesterday and immediately stirred up controversy following allegations that he smashed the cellphone of an adoring fan who had tried to take a selfie with him. Brown arrived at Moi International Airport in a private jet a few minutes to midday and was immediately whisked to the English Point Marina amid claims that adoring fans tried to swarm his entourage as he left the VIP Lounge, causing a stampede and security scare. It is not clear why these fans were allowed access into the VIP lounge. The Standard on Sunday could not independently confirm claims by Brenda Sugut, who describes herself as and ardent Brown fan. She claimed her Sh80,000 phone was partially damaged after the musician snatched it from her hand and threw it on the tarmac. &ldquo;I was at the airport to pick my friend who had just landed for the concert when I heard that Chris had landed. When he came through the VIP section, I asked him if I could take a selfie with him but he did not answer. I figured that since he is a superstar, he would not answer, so I proceeded to take one and that is when he grabbed the phone and threw it on the ground,&rdquo; said Brenda. Brenda claimed she was taken aback by this because and demanded an apology. &ldquo;Social media is trending with the incident and I am feeling embarrassed. I regret being there in the first place,&rdquo; she said.
