At least&nbsp;120&nbsp;people have been&nbsp;arrested&nbsp;in different towns in Machakos County as&nbsp;police&nbsp;mount a major crackdown on criminal elements following last Thursday&rsquo;s killing of six guards in Mitaboni. The crackdown was carried out in shopping centres at Matungulu, Kangundo, Kathiani and Machakos sub counties after the county security team endorsed the operation following a meeting with Governor Alfred Mutua on Friday. Yesterday, County Commissioner Matilda Sakwa said the operation on&nbsp;suspected&nbsp;criminals will continue throughout the county. &ldquo;We will not relent in the fight against crime, and&nbsp;police&nbsp;have been mobilised to intensify patrols especially at night to ensure residents are safe from all manner of threats,&rdquo; Ms Sakwa told The Standard on Sunday, yesterday. Earlier, Governor Mutua held a meeting with the county&rsquo;s top security chiefs after which they jointly addressed the media and condemned the killings of the watchmen, which also left two guards seriously injured. The crackdown came even as Dr Mutua announced that two men&nbsp;suspected&nbsp;to have been part of a gang that butchered the six guards in Mitaboni and Ngelani on Thursday had beenarrested.
