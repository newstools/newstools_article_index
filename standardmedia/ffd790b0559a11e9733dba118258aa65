Central Organisation of Trade Unions, COTU (K) fully supports calls by Members of Parliament for the immediate sacking of the top management of Kenya Airways led by its Chief Executive Mr. Mbuvi Ngunze. &ldquo;It is now over five months since COTU (K) made similar demands to the government and the sacking of both the top management and Group Chief Executive at Kenya Airways should have been done as of yesterday to save the National Carrier from eventual collapse since the team&rsquo;s continued stay at Kenya Airways will no doubt seal the fate of Kenya Airways and see the airline collapse,&rdquo; said COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli in a press statement. Atwoli said that he listened to the Chief Executive&nbsp; Officer speak on the future of the airline and can confirm that he has no single vision nor idea on how to revive the ailing airline and his continued stay at the helm of KQ will make even its eventual revival very difficult for the Kenyan government. &ldquo;The top management team at KQ has totally run out of any ideas and COTU (K) is concerned that despite the airline going down on its knees at every sunrise, the Kenya government continue to make unfulfilled promises on its plan to revive the airline to its profitability but unless the government moves with speed to listen to the calls by our MPs and workers as a Nation, Kenya will pay heavily for watching from a distance as our true Pride of Africa goes down to no take- off.&rdquo; The COTU (K) secretary general insisted that this is a management team that has presided over the highest ever sacking of employees in the name of redundancies and cutting costs and as the affected families lost out on their sources of livelihoods, the team continues to announce airline loses while holding on to their offices undeterred. &ldquo;For KQ to be back on its feet, these individuals must leave.&rdquo; READ MORE MPs demand probe on Kenya Airways in heated debate Don't let politics cloud Kenya Airways woes Audit: How KQ bought two planes at Sh2b &mdash; only to sell them at a throw-away Sh210m
