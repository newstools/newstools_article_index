Doubts swirled over the future of&nbsp;the Opposition coalition as ODM leader&nbsp;Raila Odinga&rsquo;s allies insisted he is&nbsp;the strongest CORD presidential candidate.&nbsp; As Raila backers dismissed demands&nbsp;by Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula that Raila steps down&nbsp;for them, it also emerged that three&nbsp;lawyers are this week set to present guidelines on selection of the CORD&nbsp;flag bearer. ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s allies have maintained that he is the strongest Opposition presidential candidate. The leaders spoke as it emerged that three lawyers are to present guidelines on selection of the CORD flagbearer before this weekend. The Orange party leaders John Mbadi (chairman), James Opiyo (political affairs secretary), Florence Mutua (organising secretary), Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay County chairperson) as well as MP Fred Outa said Raila was CORD&rsquo;s best bet to win the presidency. &ldquo;Raila has suffered a lot for this country and we would, therefore, like him to be given the opportunity. We know that it (talk of discord in the coalition) is propaganda being peddled by our competitors and are using some of the members to create division,&rdquo; said Mr Mbadi.

Mutua said ODM had set its sights on the presidency and nothing would distract them. &ldquo;Raila commands over five million votes nationally and the number has gone up. Why then shouldn&rsquo;t he be supported then he can play kingmaker in 2022?&rdquo; she posed. She went on: &ldquo;ODM as a party has gained momentum and nothing is going to stop the liberation train that has already taken off. As is expected from the history of all coalitions, some partners will fall off for their own reasons but we will gain more who believe in our cause as we move along.&rdquo; &ldquo;Political power is all about the people and anyone simply sitting somewhere and waiting for some kind of coronation can only be deluding himself,&rdquo; said Mr Opiyo. However, Mbadi and Wanga downplayed suggestions of a rift in the coalition. &ldquo;The party leader has spoken very clearly on the issue and said we are not going it alone as ODM. I don&rsquo;t think we have pronounced ourselves as a party on the issue. The party&rsquo;s central committee has not made such a resolution,&rdquo; said Mbadi. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
