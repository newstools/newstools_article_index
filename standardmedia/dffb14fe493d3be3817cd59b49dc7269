Ford Kenya has vowed to ensure a senator and two MPs who switched loyalty to the new Jubilee Party lose their seats. In a move likely to cause uproar in the coming days, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula&#39;s party has instructed its secretary general Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren) to write to the three, elected on Ford Kenya party ticket, to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them. The three, Senator John Munyes (Turkana) and MPs Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga) and Nicholas Ngikor (Turkana East) on Saturday ditched the party and joined Jubilee. Yesterday at the party headquarters in Nairobi, Wetang&#39;ula warned that any leader who was elected on a Ford-K ticket but has since changed allegiance must face the electorate and get fresh mandate. &quot;We wish those who left our party well and thank them for being part of us. But because they still have our name and have crossed over, we expect to have a by-election as per the law. We have instructed the SG to write show-cause letters to them for associating with Jubilee while still in Ford Kenya,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula. The senator said all CORD partners have all agreed in principle to a mini-poll for defectors.
