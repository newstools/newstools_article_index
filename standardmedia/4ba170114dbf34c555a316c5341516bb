Garissa Governor Nathif Jama has blamed officers from the defunct Transitional Authority for being behind financial and procurement irregularities during his first year in office. The governor who appeared for the second time before the Senate Public Accounts Committee to respond to audit queries raised from the counties 2013/2014 budget, said the authority officials were not co-operative before their exit. &quot;The authority did not form an audit team before they left,&quot; he said.
