A 13-year-old girl is nursing wounds she sustained after she was defiled on September 1. The girl, according to Leah Wanini, a paralegal in Mukuru Kwa Reuben, where the incident occurred, was retrieved from a shack by neighbours who were responding to her screams. &quot;We haven&#39;t ascertained if the shack was the attacker&#39;s home or if he had randomly picked it for his plans. The man was found hiding under the bed where he had defiled her. He threatened to kill the minor if she raised alarm,&quot; Wanini told The Standard. The girl had been sent by her sister to buy soap at a shop located a short distance from where they lived. &quot;She had taken long to return and that is when alarm was raised and her screams heard,&quot; Leah added. A toll free SMS code for reporting cases of rape and defilement has been launched.
