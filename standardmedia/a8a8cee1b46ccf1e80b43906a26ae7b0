NAIROBI: Jubilee leaders say President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto will easily win in 2017 now that the ICC cases are behind them. &quot;They no longer have the ICC baggage and that is why they will easily floor their rivals in next year&#39;s General Election,&quot; National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale told a rally at Mlango Kubwa in Mathare Constituency yesterday. They told CORD to also prepare for defeat in the race for Nairobi governor&#39;s seat, currently held by Dr Evans Kidero. Duale said Uhuru and Ruto won the last elections even though the crimes against humanity cases affected their campaigns and told their rivals to get ready for another defeat. The leaders, who included Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, Woman Representative Racheal Shebesh, Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja, Nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi, MPs Nickson Korir (Langata), Steven Kariuki (Mathare), Sonia Birdi (Nominated) and Kajiado North&#39;s MP Joseph Manje, former Starehe MP Margret Wanjiru, said Jubilee has no apologies after Uhuru mocked CORD leader Raila Odinga during veteran politician William ole Ntimama&#39;s burial. &quot;The President said he will wait for a very long time to get power and we have no apologies to make,&quot; said Duale.
