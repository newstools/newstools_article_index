A 14-year-old Form One student was on Saturday night found dead at her home in Kihila of Chango sub-location in Vihiga County. Dinah Tharula, a student at Kidinye Secondary School, was found dead by her uncle, Geoffrey Onaya, on Sunday morning when he went to wake her up. The uncle lives in the same compound but in a different house. Ms Tharula lived with her grandmother, Ruth Imali, who was not at home when the incident occurred. Vihiga police boss Alfred Angengo said they suspected the girl was first raped and then killed by her assailant. &quot;We recovered a used condom at the scene. We suspect she was killed using either a panga or an axe as the body was in a bad state,&quot; Mr Angengo said. He added that there were signs of a scuffle between the girl and her assailant. The body was covered in mud although there were no signs that the house had been broken into.

Joyce Monyani, a neighbour, said the girl&#39;s grandmother had gone to her matrimonial home in Masana, Hamisi constituency, on Saturday and could not come return home because of a heavy downpour. HEAVY RAINFALL &quot;The other grandchild who stays in the same compound was away and was also stranded because of the heavy rainfall, which meant she (Tharula) had to stay alone through the night,&quot; said Ms Monyani. &quot;So she was an easy target for the person who committed this crime.&quot; &quot;The girl was brought here by her mother last December to keep her grandmother company after the death of her grandfather,&quot; she added. She noted that the girl&#39;s uncle had gone to the house in the evening and asked her for supper. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
