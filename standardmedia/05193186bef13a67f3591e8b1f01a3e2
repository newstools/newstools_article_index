Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has recorded a statement for allegedly claiming to be &#39;acting President&#39;. Mr Sonko presented himself to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Sunday evening where spent two hours before leaving at about 8pm. Yesterday, sources privy to the investigations told&nbsp;The Standard&nbsp;he denied the claims, adding that he had witnesses to back his statement. Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Keriako Tobiko had directed the police and DCI Director Ndegwa Muhoro to investigate the senator over the statement he made on Friday in Machakos County. Sonko made the remarks during the burial of former Kathiani MP Wavinya Ndeti&rsquo;s husband in what later caused a storm among residents and other leaders. Members of the Opposition led by CORD Principal Raila Odinga stormed out of the funeral as soon as the senator became &quot;uncontrollable&quot;.

But Sonko, in a video posted on his twitter page, denied that he had crowned himself number three in command.
