A court has blocked an MP from contesting for a position in a teachers&rsquo; union. The Employment and Labour Relations Court stopped Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui from contesting in the Kuppet elections. &nbsp;Judge Linnet Ndolo held that the MP cannot be a full time state officer, and at the same time run union matters. Tonui has been the union&rsquo;s assistant treasurer. &mdash; Kamau Muthoni
