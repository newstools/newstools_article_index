MOMBASA: President Uhuru Kenyatta has signed the Fisheries Management Development Bill. The new law allows the Kenyan navy to intercept unauthorised fishing ships in Kenya&#39;s waters and also protect the country&#39;s&#39;s Exclusive Economic Zone. The law establishes Kenya Fisheries Services and Kenya Fisheries Advisory Council to ensure conservation, development of standards on management, sustainable use and protection of the country&#39;s fisheries resources. The President signed the new law at the Port of Mombasa on Saturday after he commissioned the Sh30 billion second container terminal. And the President has formed a committee to formulate strategies on how Kenya can protect its marine resources in the Indian Ocean. The team, which will be chaired by Chief of Defence Forces Samson Mwathethe, has two months to propose ways the country can increase its surveillance in the Indian Ocean and develop necessary infrastructure for the sector.
