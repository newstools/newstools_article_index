In an affidavit the tenants have revealed that they never gave the civil society mandate to sue the county government on their behalf. The tenants who have come to the court as interested party want the suit filed by the civil societies be dismissed on grounds that they were not contacted about the filing of the suit against the county government. The civil society is questioning the issue of land ownership in the earmarked estates. They insist the land where the project will stand on is a public land and should not be allocated to private developers. The judge ordered the application by the 700 tenants who want to be enjoined as an interested party to be heard on September 22.
