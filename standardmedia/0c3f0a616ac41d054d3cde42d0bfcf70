Nairobi&nbsp;Governor Evans Kidero has vowed to do his best to ensure Raila Odinga wins the presidency in next year&#39;s elections. Dr Kidero said he will do anything including bankrolling the ODM leader&#39;s campaigns. &quot;I will do anything to ensure that Raila clinches the Presidency even if it means using my money,&quot; said Kidero. He spoke in Nairobi where he backed Raila&#39;s sentiments that all defectors should either resign or be removed from the party by force, and have by-elections done. He called for Opposition unity for Jubilee to be defeated.
