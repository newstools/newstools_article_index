The proposed merger to form the new Jubilee Party (JP) suffered a setback after two parties withdrew. The Party of National Unity (PNU) and Saba Saba Asili officials Wednesday said their parties will not fold. They said they are not among parties that will join on Saturday to form President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election vehicle. PNU Secretary General John Anunda Wednesday issued a notice calling off the party&#39;s National Delegates Conference (NDC) set for Friday and rescheduled it to October 28. &quot;We cannot go with their programme. We are not for the merger,&quot; Anunda told The Standard on phone.

Saba Saba Asili Secretary General Joseph Kanguchu Wednesday said they cancelled their National Executive Council because the merger&#39;s steering committee ignored their their proposals, especially on sharing of slots in JP NEC. In a letter to the Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&#39;u dated September 6, 2016, the party indicates that it had withdrawn its earlier decision to merge, and directed their delegates to keep off the meeting at Kasarani Stadium.
