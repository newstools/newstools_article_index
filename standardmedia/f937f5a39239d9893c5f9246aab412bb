A company that was paid part of Sh129 million for transporting election material in the March 2013 General Election was registered in September 2014, according to the Auditor General&#39;s report. According to the 2014-15 audit report, the electoral body is reported to have paid Sh50,487,440 through a payment voucher number 482 on November 27, 2014. However, an audit of the payment revealed that the company, which purportedly transported materials for the March 2013 polls, was only registered on September 12, 2014. The Auditor General has raised questions over Sh129 million paid to two companies contracted by the electoral commission to transport polling materials during the elections. These are among several audit queries raised by the Auditor General report on procurement of goods and services by the commission in the 2013 General Election. The report by the Auditor General Edward Ouko further revealed that the commission accepted an irregular letter on October 13, 2014 in an attempt to defeat the audit trail.

The audit further revealed that the commission used only five vehicles and not 27 vehicles which resulted to an over payment of sh42,679,460. &quot;In response to a Draft Audit Report Ref: IEBC/2014-2015/(7) dated 8 March 2016, the commission provided additional documents on 10 instead of 22 vehicles, an indication that the commission is unable to provide satisfactory explanation, information and assistance in writing,&quot; the audit report notes. A further analysis of documents also showed a motor vehicle - KAQ 706Z - was operating in Nakuru while at the same time another document shows the same motor vehicle was in Teso North and South. The Auditor noted that some documents examined during the audit appeared to have been altered and signatures deleted in another copy presented as evidence to the commission.
