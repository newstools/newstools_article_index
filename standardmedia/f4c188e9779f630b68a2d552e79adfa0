Construction of the Ethiopia-Kenya power line hangs in the balance after a group of farmers moved to block the project. The farmers from Ihinu village in Naivasha said they would not allow the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (Ketraco) carry on with the project until the issue of compensation was sorted out. The 550kV eastern inter-connector line is expected to enable the country to import 400mw from Ethiopia by 2018. Over the weekend, the farmers blocked the company staff from erecting power masts until their grievances were resolved. Joel Konyo, one of the affected farmers, said the company had not fully engaged them in the project, adding that they would not allow the works to continue. Mr Konyo said the compensation Ketraco was offering was very low compared to the value of land in the area.

Area MCA Samuel Waithuki admitted that there was a problem, saying there was need for more consultations from all the parties before the project could continue. He said several families had been affected by the power line, which passed through their farms, adding that farming would also be affected. &quot;The residents rely solely on farming and the project will affect large parcels of land hence the need to resolve the matter of compensation,&quot; he said. Earlier, members of the nearby Naivasha Traders Housing Co-operative had accused the power company of delaying compensation for the Olkaria-Lessos-Kisumu power line. The families from Kayole estate now want an agreement signed between them and the company three years ago reviewed, noting that the cost of land had since risen. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
