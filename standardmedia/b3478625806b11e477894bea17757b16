President Uhuru Kenyatta Tuesday lamented of being frustrated by rampant corruption in the country despite his efforts to curb the vice. He said his administration had been on the fore front of the matter as compared to any other. &ldquo;Show me an administration since independence that has taken action on corruption like I have,&rdquo; said Uhuru. Speaking during State House Summit on Governance, Uhuru said he had provided all resources that institutions had asked for to be able to deal with corruption but no fruits were forthcoming. &ldquo;If there is one issue that has frustrated me is corruption because the pressure is on me to do something about it,&rdquo; said Uhuru, referring to it as an issue that has been at the centre stage of every Kenyan public debate. Uhuru wondered why no progress has been made in the investigation of the public officials who had been named in the list of shame, putting to task Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission CEO Halakhe Waqo and Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko who were among the Summit attendees.
