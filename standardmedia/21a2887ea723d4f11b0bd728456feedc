Police are holding 17 Nigerians over claims of questionable immigration status. They were arrested in a swoop in Mlolongo, off Mombasa Road, Machakos County, and found with 48 laptops. Police said those arrested were staying in groups of between three and four, and that some of them are believed to be in the country illegally because their visas had expired. Head of Special Crimes Prevention Unit Noah Katumo said the laptops were handed over to the cybercrime unit for analysis to check if they were involved in any form of fraud. &quot;We have invited officials from immigration and other units to help in checking their activities in the country. They claim to have come as tourists and businessmen but some of the suspects&#39; visas have expired,&quot; said Mr Katumo. Locals had apparently complained that some of the suspects were involved in crime hence the police move. Katumo said the operation will continue until all foreigners who are in the country illegally are arrested.
