The Government will provide enough security ahead of the forthcoming by-election, Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery said. Speaking in Mosiro at the weekend, where campaigns pitting Jubilee against the Orange party are gathering momentum,&nbsp; Nkaisery appealed to both camps to avoid inciting residents. &quot;My Ministry is very keen on this matter, anybody who will incite people will face the full force of the law,&quot; he said. The CS said he would not want to see a repeat of what happened last week when Governor David Nkedianye was forced to leave the podium while addressing a gathering. &quot;I&#39;m warning people not to interfere with others&#39; rallies, what happened to Governor Nkedianye was not good, he is leading the ODM campaign team, who advised him to attend a Jubilee rally?&quot; posed Nkaissery. He said the by-election will come and go but the people of Mosiro should be left to live in peace.
