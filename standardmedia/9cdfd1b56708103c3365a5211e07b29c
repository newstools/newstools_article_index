Luhya community leaders want Western region to be given the secretary general&#39;s post in the new Jubilee Party. The co-chair of the steering committee that spearheaded the merger process Noah Wekesa, former Westlands MP Fred Gumo and Nairobi-based politician Stanley Livondo stated that if the SG is not given to a person from the region, selling Jubilee in Western will be a tall order. Speaking while drumming up support for the Water CS Eugene Wamalwa at Friends Church in Riruta, the leaders urged more people to register as voters in Nairobi.
