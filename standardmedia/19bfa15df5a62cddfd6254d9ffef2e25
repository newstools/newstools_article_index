An order has been issued blocking some private companies from dumping their waste at the local dumpsite located in Karai estate following a major row. The dispute involving several groups arose over the control of the lucrative garbage collection business around the lakeside town. The bone of contention is the awarding of tenders to new companies by the county government to the chagrin of former players in the sector. It emerged that senior politicians in the county had an interest in the trade, which involves collecting garbage from various residential estates at a fee. Garbage Tenders Issuing the order, Naivasha Sub-County Administrator Julius Nyaata said the law had to be followed after the tender was awarded to the winners.
