The Kenya Film Classification Board has called for media blackout against politicians who engage in incitement and war mongering. Board Chief Executive Officer Ezekiel Mutua said providing space to such leaders was equal to glorifying evil, and one way to tame them was to deny them media coverage. Mr Mutua said the board will continue advocating for regulation of media content that seeks to destroy nationhood, promote radicalisation and ultimately disrupt the social order. &nbsp;Speaking at Chuka University during a joint prayers service to foster cohesion and integrity among students, he said, it would be unfortunate for the youth to watch leaders fighting in podiums. &nbsp;&quot;Time has come for the media to play its role in promoting positive moral values by portraying what unites us more than what divides us,&quot; he said. Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura warned that brawls among politicians create a bad precedent for the 2017 General Election.
