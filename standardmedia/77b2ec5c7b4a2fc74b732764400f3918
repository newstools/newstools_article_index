Kenyans will wait a little longer to know if the country will send her troops to troubled South Sudan. This is after National Assembly Majority&nbsp;Leader Aden Duale yesterday withdrew a special motion that could have seen members of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) deployed to the neighbouring country. This comes a day after US Secretary of State John Kerry visited the country. The deployment of troops to South Sudan was expected to generate heated debate, as many leaders, especially those allied to the Opposition, pushing for the recall of KDF soldiers from Somalia. &quot;I withdraw the motion to allow further consultations on the matter,&quot; said Duale, who last week had moved the controversial motion. Two weeks ago, the United Nations Security Council authorised the deployment of a robust force of 4,000 to the youngest nation in Africa, following the resumption of fighting after forces allied to rebel leader Riek Machar clashed with government troops.
