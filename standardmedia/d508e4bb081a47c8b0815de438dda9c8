The Seychelles Vice President will complete the five-year term of resigning President James Michel, the state house said yesterday. This is despite a shake-up of national politics after the opposition won parliamentary elections this month. President Michel, whose party has ruled Seychelles since 1977, announced his resignation on Tuesday but it was initially unclear whether new elections would be held. Yesterday, State House issued a statement saying Vice-President Danny Faure would be sworn in on October 16 and finish Michel&#39;s term.
