Dairy farmers in Murang&#39;a have registered a 20-fold increase in milk production to 127,000 kilograms per day in two years. The farmers will receive Sh127 million for their August deliveries through the 35 coolers. Contracted milk transporters have been helping in milk collection and delivery to the coolers at a cost of Sh2 per kilo. Wednesday, Murang&#39;a Governor Mwangi wa Iria said production was on the rise following major interventions by his administration to support the dairy sector. &quot;Provision of animal feeds, which include fodder, sweet potato veins and subsided artificial insemination are some of the interventions behind the success of the sector that has turned out to be a major income earner in Murang&#39;a,&quot; said Iria. Speaking at Kenol after addressing youth polytechnic managers, Mr Wa Iria attributed the jump in production to better organisation of dairy farmers, cooling equipment and improved farming practices. Murang&#39;a County government in 2014/2015 bought 35 milk coolers which were donated to dairy cooperatives.

This venture has attracted more farmers to join Murang&#39;a County Creameries (MCC). The youth in the county have benefited from dairy cows, which they take through a loan and pay through deductions from milk deliveries. The governor said a milk processing plant in Maragua area will be operational in three months to handle surplus milk after deliveries to the contracted processor. &quot;A contract agreement with Brookside of 80,000 kilogrammes per day will continue as the plant will only process the surplus milk, which will be sold under the brand name of Murang&#39;a Fresh,&quot; said the governor.
