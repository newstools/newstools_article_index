Four MCAs allied to the now disbanded Jubilee Alliance have defected to Kanu as a fallout generated by last weekend&#39;s party merger begins to take shape. Mochongoi ward MCA Jackson Tarus (TNA), Ribkwo ward&#39;s Daniel Tuwit (URP) and Solomon Makal (Kolowa) were received by West Pokot senator, Prof John Lonyangapuo. Also joining Kanu from URP was Selemoi Makale who until the dissolution of URP was the party&#39;s secretary general in Tiaty Constituency. Kanu has dismissed the recently launched Jubilee Party as a mere show off. Speaking in Tiaty, Baringo County, Prof Lonyangapuo described the merger as mere celebration. &quot;The post-election agreement is still in place and the drama Kenyans witnessed at Kasarani was unnecessary and a waste of public resources. Anybody thinking of taking this country back to single party state is doomed,&#39;&#39; he said.

Those still accepting to be confused with handouts to elect corrupt leaders must count their days over,&#39;&#39; said the senator. Lonyangapuo, who was accompanied by former Kacheliba MP Samuel Poghisio and Baringo County Assembly Speaker William Kamket, said Kanu would not support any presidential candidate or coalition in next year&#39;s general election. He said the former ruling party would instead concentrate on strengthening grassroots support, and asked political aspirants feeling uncomfortable with the merger of political parties to form JP to join Kanu. Mr Kamket said Tiaty MP Asman Kamama had failed to redeem the region from poverty despite Sh100 million allocated to the constituency through CDF yearly and called for leadership change. &quot;It is a fact that opposition strongholds have been given more attention than regions whose political loyalty is inclined towards government. This is why time has come to take a bold move and say it&#39;s over,&quot; he said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
