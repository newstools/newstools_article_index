Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has come under fire from the Controller of Budget for alleged poor performance. Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo, in the County Governments Budget Implementation Review Report, said only Sh158.8 billion was disbursed to counties as equitable share against an intended Sh196.13 billion in the 2015/2016 financial year due to under-performance by the tax collection body. &ldquo;The national government has attributed failure to fully disburse the equitable share for the period to under-performance in revenue collection by the Kenya Revenue Authority,&rdquo; says Ms Odhiambo in the report. She says the equitable share of revenue raised in the last financial year constituted only 81 per cent of funds disbursed to counties, thus stalling county development projects. Nairobi City County received the highest allocation of Sh8.8 billion against an expected Sh9.81 billion disbursement.
