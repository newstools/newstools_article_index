Former Eldoret South MP Peris Simam has been admitted to hospital after she fell sick at a prison in Eldoret. Mrs Simam, her husband Enock and four others were found guilty by an Eldoret court on Friday last week over corruption. Sources privy to the family told The Standard yesterday that the MP fell sick shortly after she was taken to Eldoret Women Prison. And her husband, who had been found guilty alongside the former MP, is in prison. The officer in charge of Eldoret GK Prison Francis Kabiro said four male convicts were brought to the facility after a court found them guilty of various offenses related to economic crime. &quot;I can confirm that I booked four male remandees at the facility who had been convicted by the court over an economic crime. One of the men reportedly said to have collapsed in the dock during the case ruling was in stable condition at the facility,&quot; Mr Kabiro said. But when The Standard yesterday afternoon visited the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, our team could not access the MP in her private wing which was heavily guarded by three prison warders.
