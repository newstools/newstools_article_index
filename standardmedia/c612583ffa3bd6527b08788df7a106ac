ODM leader Raila Odinga today starts a&nbsp;four-day tour of Taita Taveta and Kwale counties&nbsp;on the back of defections by seven party&nbsp;leaders.&nbsp;Raila&rsquo;s tour is seen as a re- sponse to&nbsp;the ruling coalition&rsquo;s forays&nbsp;into the region that have seen six Opposition&nbsp;MPs and a governor&nbsp;join Jubilee Party. ODM lost Kwale&nbsp;Governor Salim&nbsp;Mvurya and MPs&nbsp;Gideon Mung&rsquo;aro,&nbsp;Mustafa Iddi, Masoud&nbsp;Mwahima,&nbsp;Zainab Chidzuga, Peter Shehe and&nbsp;Khatib Mwashetani.&nbsp;ODM leader Raila Odinga today begins a four-day tour of Taita Taveta and Kwale counties in an attempt to counter the Jubilee tide in the region. Raila&#39;s third tour of Coast region in a month comes in the wake of major defections by ODM leaders to the ruling coalition. He will hold a series of rallies in what is being seen as an attempt to stamp his authority in the region that has traditionally supported him. ODM lost Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya to the newly-formed Jubilee Party. MPs Gideon Mung&#39;aro (Kilifi North), Mustafa Iddi (Kilifi South), Masoud Mwahima (Likoni) and Kwale Woman Representative Zainab Chidzuga have also ditched the Orange party to join Jubilee Party. The MPs were present at the launch of the party on whose ticket President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto will seek re-election.

The seat is currently held by ODM&#39;s Amason Kingi. Speaking at his Dabaso home in Watamu last Thursday, Mung&#39;aro said Jubilee had a strong footing in Coast region, citing Mvurya&#39;s defection to the ruling coalition. Popularise Jubilee He declared he would &quot;storm&quot; Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&#39;s backyard to popularise Jubilee and weaken ODM.&nbsp; Mung&#39;aro said he defected to Jubilee to be close to power and State resources for the benefit of Coast region residents. In what is seen as his strategy to counter the Jubilee tide and fight off the perception that the ruling coalition was raiding his turf, Raila, who has just returned from a four-day tour of Germany, will pitch tent at the coast until Saturday.
