President Uhuru Kenyatta has invited his critics to a State House discussion on the Government&#39;s record in fighting graft. State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu confirmed on Sunday that the Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua had sent out the invitation letters to vocal critics of the Jubilee administration to offer solutions to the problem of corruption at the governance and accountability summit. Among those expected at the summit are anti-graft crusader John Githongo, economist David Ndii, Senators James Orengo (Siaya), Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o (Kisumu) and Boni Khalwale (Kakamega) as well as MPs Ababu Namwamba (Budalang&#39;i) and Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet).&nbsp; State House has also extended an invite to all the 47 governors and National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale and his Senate counterpart Kindiki Kithure. Mr Esipisu warned participants against taking the opportunity to attack the government, saying they will be looking for solutions to the identified problems. &quot;This is not the space for chest-thumping and finger pointing. It is a space where only facts will be required and where Kenyans expect to see answers on the way forward in terms of the battle against graft and other integrity-related vices,&quot; he said during a press briefing at the Kisumu State Lodge.&nbsp; READ MORE Ouko team faults law on merger of political parties and wants it reviewed Greed, the spanner in the works for devolution in Kenya Raila five demands to Uhuru over borrowing spree &quot;We expect to see captains of industry drawn from the organised and informal businesses, religious leaders, critics like John Githongo and David Ndii, as well as organisations, agencies and partners critical to the fight against corruption.&quot; Mr Githongo, who is Inuka Trust chief executive, hit headlines in 2004 when he exposed massive corruption involving government ministers in former President Mwai Kibaki&#39;s administration.
