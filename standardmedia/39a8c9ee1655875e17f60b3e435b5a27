Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has been cleared of wrongdoing in inquest into death of University of Nairobi student Mercy Keino. The findings of an inquest into the murder of Mercy Keino was delivered Friday morning at the Kehancha Law Courts in Migori County. In his ruling, Kehancha Magistrate Peter Ndwiga said there was no evidence linking Governor Kabogo to the murder of Mercy Keino on the night of 17th June, 2011. Peter Ndwiga made the ruling at his new work station in Kahencha as he was the magistrate who heard the proceedings at the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi before his transfer. He said all the evidence produced did not link the people who had been mentioned in the death. Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko had ordered a public inquiry to establish how the student was killed after police failed to link suspects to the murder.
