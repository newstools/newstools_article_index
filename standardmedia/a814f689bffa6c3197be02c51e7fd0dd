ASIA: A gunman in an Afghan army uniform on Wednesday shot and killed at least one international soldier and wounded five at a base in the Afghan capital before being killed himself, an Afghan military official said. The shooting took place at about 11 a.m., while the international troops were visiting a base in Kabul, said Dawlat Waziri, a defense ministry spokesman. A spokesman for the NATO-led coalition said officials were looking into the reports but could not confirm the incident. The suspected attacker was killed when the international troops returned fire, Waziri said.
