More than half of Jubilee supporters (53 per cent) will not vote back their incumbent&nbsp;senators&nbsp;in the next General Election if they contest, a new survey has revealed. The survey, by Ipsos, also indicates that only four out of every ten Jubilee supporters are willing to vote back the current governors. It says&nbsp;senators&nbsp;from Rift Valley and Coast as the&nbsp;most&nbsp;unlikely to retain their seats in the next polls. According to the survey, only 29 per cent of Rift Valley and 35 per cent of Coast residents are likely to vote back their current&nbsp;senators. However, Nairobi&nbsp;Senator&nbsp;Mike Sonko has the highest likelihood (76 per cent) of retaining the seat. He is followed by&nbsp;senators&nbsp;in North Eastern and Western with 64 per cent 61 per cent respectively. &quot;Asked whether they thought their current&nbsp;senator&nbsp;is likely to be re-elected, only 51 per cent feel this is the case, while 57 per cent of Opposition supporters are more optimistic than the 47 per cent among the Jubilee supporters,&quot; reads the Ipsos survey.

This will add three more votes from the 34 per cent who did not vote in 2013. Some 57 per cent of CORD supporters will also be voting back their respective&nbsp;senators, with at least four out of every ten supporters from the Nyanza stronghold sharing the same view. &quot;Again, this is not to say that&nbsp;senators&nbsp;in CORD areas are necessarily performing better, or that their supporters view their performance more positively,&quot; said Ipsos&#39; Lead Analyst Tom Wolf. He insisted that these results cannot answer this &#39;deeper&#39; question on the more than average support accorded to Cord&nbsp;senators. Tom added that even as some range of expectation is seen regionally with residents of Nairobi being the&nbsp;most&nbsp;confident (76 per cent) and those in Rift Valley the least (only 29 per cent): &quot;...the process of re-election involves both (one) winning one&#39;s party nomination and (two) defeating one&#39;s rivals in the election itself. It is unclear just what accounts for this disparity.&quot;
