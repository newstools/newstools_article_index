NAIROBI: The Standard and Daily Nation would use recognise rather than recognize; cheat, other than cheater; adviser, instead of advisor; theatre, and not theater etc. In other words, they prefer the British to the American English. But owing to America&rsquo;s importance in world affairs, sometimes these dailies are unsuccessful in their endeavour to achieve consistency. Thus, for instance, &lsquo;joyrider&rsquo; (a word in the vocabulary of the American English) achieved dominance during the just-ended Rio Olympics, with the two leading local papers carrying a number of articles in which the word featured prominently (Standard on Saturday, Aug 13; Sunday Nation, Aug 14 &amp; 21; Daily Nation, Aug 19, 23 &amp; 24; The Standard, Aug 23). Some dictionaries with British links &ndash; the Oxford, Collins, Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, COBUILD, and Chambers &ndash; define &lsquo;joyrider&rsquo; as a person who steals a vehicle, primarily a car, and drives it crazily merely for the purpose of acquiring enjoyment. And &lsquo;joyriding&rsquo;, they add, is the act (offence) of taking someone&rsquo;s motor car, without their consent, and driving it around dangerously for nothing but fun. Given the definition cited, are there joyriders in Kenya? Many would take Kenyans to be &lsquo;very serious&rsquo; humans; people who mean business. When a few of them snatch a machine from somebody, their objective is to sell it (as a whole unit or spare parts) to make money and escape poverty. Actually, in this part of the world, if a person steals a vehicle just to enjoy driving it around recklessly, that would be seen as sheer lunacy. Anyway, back to the meaning of the word in focus. An American dictionary titled &lsquo;Merriam-Webster Collegiate&rsquo;, provides another meaning of the word: acting in disregard of cost or consequences. This is what the local papers usually mean whenever they use the word. While still at it, let&rsquo;s examine the following sentence. &lsquo;The culture of joy-riders is thought to have started with the Seoul Olympics in 1988&rsquo; (Sunday Nation Aug 21, page 13). No, it should be, &lsquo;The culture of joyriding is thought....&rsquo; One wonders whether the word (and its other forms) is open, closed (solid), or hyphenated compound. Should it be spelt joy rider, joyrider or joy-rider; joy ride, joyride or joy-ride; joy riding, joyriding or joy-riding? The solution lies with either the newspapers&rsquo; style guides or English language dictionaries. Meanwhile, last week&rsquo;s piece used the word &lsquo;bear&rsquo; as a finite verb. The word &ndash; the manner in which it was employed &ndash; required an &lsquo;-s&rsquo;, which unfortunately was missing, thus making the sentence faulty.
