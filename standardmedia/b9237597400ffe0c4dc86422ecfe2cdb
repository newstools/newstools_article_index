For the umpteenth time, our trade and diplomatic partners, particularly European Union ambassadors to Kenya, have called for political dialogue ahead of the 2017 General Election. This concern for our welfare should sober the belligerents on both sides of the political divide. Leaders must step down from their high perches, stop trading insults in public and embrace dialogue as the only way forward in making Kenya a safe place. A lot of investment and effort have been put into marketing Kenya as a safe place to set up business or simply visit. Such efforts should not be defeated by the lack of political consensus on how to manage and run the country for the benefit of all. The political maturity of Kenyans is directly proportional to that of their leaders who, sadly, have exhibited high levels of intolerance. Often, such intolerance has acted as a trigger to violence. The Eldoret incident on Tuesday this week highlights such danger. Supporters of leaders who had been asked to record statements with the police on account of allegedly inflammatory utterances engaged the police in running battles. Such incidents not only polarise the country, they give us a preview of what to expect if the country goes to the 2017 General Election without adequate structures in place to preclude discontent. It is important that the truce agreed upon by the Government and the Opposition leading to the formation of a joint select parliamentary committee to initiate electoral reforms bears fruit. Sobriety must prevail to allow for a logical conclusion without either party appearing to act as the stumbling block. But because the onus of implementation of recommendations falls on the Government, it must go out of its way to ensure everything runs on schedule, thereby washing its hands of blame. The interests of the country must override any other concerns. READ MORE Why I chose to join the Jubilee Party Raila to rally Rift and Nyanza supporters Raila's party meets over defectors
