Hoteliers in Kisumu are demanding Sh100 million from county governments in the Western region. Led by the Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers Western Region Chair William Orondo, the hoteliers have now threatened to withdraw services until they receive their full payment. They have further revealed that one of the counties owes various hotels Sh30 million for services offered two years ago. &ldquo;These counties have a tendency of taking credit in a rotational way. After acquiring debts, they seek services from hotels,&rdquo; noted Orondo. He continued: &ldquo;It is either the county systems are flawed, or someone is just not doing their job well.&rdquo;Jumuia Hotel&rsquo;s Manager Emmanuel Waya said one county owes them Sh2 million. He said it seems they are playing a losing game since whenever they ask about payment they are always told to resend invoices. &ldquo;At this rate, we may stop serving counties that owe us because we are really inconvenienced. We are desperate because we also need to pay our suppliers within 60 days,&rdquo; he said.
