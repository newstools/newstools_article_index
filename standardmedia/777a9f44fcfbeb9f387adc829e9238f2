Jubilee MPs in Western have denounced the Luhya Elders Forum and withdrawn financial support for the outfit for &quot;misleading&quot; the community. The elders led by vice chairman Burudi Nabwera over the weekend trashed Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang&#39;ula and Amani leader Musalia Mudavadi&#39;s presidential bids. The elders said they support CORD. This angered MPs friendly to Jubilee. Mumias East MP Ben Washiali&nbsp;asked the elders to return Sh500,000 he had contributed to the forum. &quot;The elders are confused and are misleading the community. I want them to pay back my contributions because they are now partisan,&quot; he said. Other Jubilee-allied MPs in the region include Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo), David Were (Matungu), Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Boniface Otsyula (Bumula) and Ayub Savula (Lugari).
