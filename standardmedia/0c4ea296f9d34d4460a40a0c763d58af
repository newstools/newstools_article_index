Tanzania&rsquo;s president has sacked two senior officials for opening a fake account to siphon money from an earthquake fund, his office has said. &nbsp;An accountant had been suspended for being part of the plan to take money collected for earthquake victims, John Magufuli&rsquo;s office added in a statement. Amantius Msole, Kagera&rsquo;s regional administrative secretary, and Steven Makonda, Bukoba city municipal council director, were fired while accountant Simbaufoo Swai had been suspended, local media reports. &nbsp;At least 16 people died and 200 were wounded in the 10 September earthquake in the northern Kagera region. Foreign governments have donated money to the earthquake fund.
