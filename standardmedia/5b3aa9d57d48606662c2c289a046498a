Angry youth closed down the United Republican Party offices to reject a list of delegates expected to represent Bomet County at the National Delegates Conference to endorse the formation of Jubilee Party. Led by Victor Rop and Patrick Rotich, the youth seized computers and locked the office leaving party officials stranded. &ldquo;We are not going to open this office until the list is redrawn and bona fide URP members included,&rdquo; said Rop. Rop accused the local URP Chairman Stephen Mutai of including his friends in the delegation going to Nairobi and locking them out. &ldquo;We have actively participated in party matters. We are appalled that Mutai, who has been a Chama Cha Mashinani supporter until recently, locked&nbsp; us out for his allies whose allegiance to the party is in doubt,&rdquo; said Rop. The nearly 200 youths argued that the action was in bad faith saying the branch chairman wanted to please his cronies. READ MORE Not so fast...

Rop, who is a URP youth delegate, vowed to stage a sit-in at the branch office until the names of individuals alleged not to be URP members are deleted. Mutai has, however, denied claims that he single-handedly drafted the list saying it came from legislators and URP Secretary General Fred Muteti. &ldquo;This should go on record. I have not played any role in drawing up the list and the youth who want to be involved should direct their grievances to the right people,&rdquo; said Mutai in an interview.
