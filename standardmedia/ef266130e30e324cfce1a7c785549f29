Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire wants Governor John Nyagarama surcharged Sh5 million for erecting campaign posters on streetlight poles. &nbsp;The demand comes a day after Mr Nyagarama pulled down the posters following intense pressure from his opponents. &nbsp;The ODM Treasurer said the governor should be surcharged for the time the posters were on display. Finance Executive Jones Omwenga said the posters were mounted to show advertising opportunities in the county.
