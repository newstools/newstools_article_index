Mukamukuu farmers&#39; cooperative society in Matungulu Sub County has issued 700 title deeds to individual members as well as public institutions. This followed a plea by the society&#39;s 2000 members to the Government to waive stamp duty levied on title deeds, which was granted through the Ministry of Lands. Consequently, the giant society held a ceremony to issue the land ownership documents at Ol Donyo Sabuk, which was presided over by Matungulu Deputy County Commissioner, Patrick Mwangi. The society&#39;s chairman George Mutiso described the issuance of title deeds as &#39;a major breakthrough&#39; for hundreds of members who had been pursuing the documents for the past thirty years without success. &quot;This is a great achievement for our members who had been rendered squatters on their own land for the past three decades and therefore the titles we are issuing out marks a new beginning for the each of them to develop economically,&quot; said Mr Mutiso. Apart from individual title deeds issued to members, dozens of public facilities including schools, dispensaries, churches and shopping centers have also benefited in the plan.
