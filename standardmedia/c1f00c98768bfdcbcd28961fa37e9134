Two medical interns at the Malindi Hospital have been arrested on suspicion of having links with a terror group. The two were arrested on Sunday night by Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers who accused them of being members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). They both studied medicine at Saratov State Medical University in Russia. According to investigators, one of the students was part of an ISIL recruitment network that police recently said was planning to use Anthrax in terror attacks. The students are said to been evading a police dragnet and were intending to relocate to Puntland, Somalia, to join an ISIL cell under Sheikh Muumin. &quot;The two were planning to acquire fake travel documents to facilitate their escape to Somalia,&quot; said another officer.
