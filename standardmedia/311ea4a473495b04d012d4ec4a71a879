BERLIN: A German teenager has suffered serious injuries after accidentally creating an explosion in the family car with air freshener. Police in the western city of Duisburg say the 17-year-old boy had been trying Wednesday to get rid of the smell of cigarette smoke in a recently purchased second-hand Volkswagen SUV. They say the teen sprayed so much air freshener inside the vehicle that it turned into a &quot;combustible gas mixture.&quot; The gas ignited when he opened the passenger door and a light switched on. Police said in a statement Thursday that the force of the explosion blew out the vehicle&#39;s large glass sunroof. The unidentified teen was hospitalized with burns to both arms.
