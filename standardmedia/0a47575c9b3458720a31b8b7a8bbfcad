A free reproductive health programme has been launched at Kapenguria County Referral Hospital. The free medical clinic being undertaken by Savings Mothers will address women&rsquo;s reproductive health problems like fistula and fibroids. As part of the project, a team of 11 obstetricians and gynecologists from USA led by&nbsp;Savings Mothers President and Medical Director Taraneh Shirazian will visit Chepareria, Kapkoris, Kishaunet and Keringet health facilities where free obstetric scans will be done. Speaking at the hospital during the launch of the programme, West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin asked mothers to take advantage of the free clinics. Mr Kachapin said since devolution started, more women are giving birth in hospital facilities which has in turn reduced infant and maternal deaths.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our mothers are being educated on importance of attending pre natal and ante natal clinics consistently. We need more of such programmes to improve the reproductive health of our mothers,&rdquo; he said.
