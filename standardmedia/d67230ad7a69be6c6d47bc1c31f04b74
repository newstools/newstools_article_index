CORD lawyer Anthony Oluoch was yesterday grilled over alleged involvement in illegal activities. Detectives questioned the lawyer for more than an hour over a city-based militia and arming of youths in Mathare, in a bid to cause chaos ahead of the 2017 General Election. Mr Oluoch recorded a statement at the Pangani Divisional Criminal Investigation Office (DCIO) where he denied the allegations levelled against him. &quot;The summons that have been issued today are part of an alleged systematic plot to cause harm to myself and some of my supporters,&quot; said Oluoch. Siaya Senator James Orengo and lawyer Apollo Mboya accompanied him. He said prior to the summons, there was a botched attempt on his life and that he was working on getting enough information on the issue so as to make a formal complaint to the police. &quot;When the attempt did not succeed, there was a decision to associate me with an alleged militia and arming of youth. There were also plans afoot to carry out a raid on my property and vehicles to perhaps plant weapons and make good this threat,&quot; he added.

The senator said the complaint did not have particular details and that it also lacked enough evidence to support the police claims. &quot;The fact that the entire leadership of the police force in this division was present goes to show there was political interference with the case,&quot; said Orengo.
