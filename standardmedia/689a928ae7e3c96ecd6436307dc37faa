Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya will now face criminal charges for allegedly assaulting a rival&#39;s supporter eight years ago. The move comes after the governor&#39;s efforts to block his prosecution were rejected by two superior courts. Mr Oparanya will on Monday appear in a Butere court to face charges of assaulting John Ojwan&#39;g Waka on April 17, 2008, in Mabole. The complainant was a political supporter of his political rival. His petition filed at Kakamega High Court to contest the charge was dismissed with costs for lacking merit, allowing the Butere lower court to go on with trial. His appeal But just before the lower court picked a date for trial, the governor filed an appeal at Kisumu Court of Appeal before justices David Maranga, Daniel Musinga and Gatembe Kairu who equally dismissed it on July 29, 2016. Butere court Thursday issued the summons to have the ODM deputy party leader appear before it to take a plea.
