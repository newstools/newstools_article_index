CAIRO:&nbsp;An Egyptian court on Saturday approved a freeze on the assets of five prominent human rights defenders and three non-governmental organisations, the latest twist in a five-year-old case in which the NGOs are accused of receiving foreign funds to sow chaos. Egyptian rights activists say they are facing the worst assault in their history amid a wider campaign to erase freedoms won in a 2011 uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak&#39;s 30-year rule. An investigating magistrate had ordered the asset freezes, but they were subject to court approval. Saturday&#39;s decision paves the way for criminal proceedings against the defendants that could lead to life sentences if they are found guilty.
