Narc party leader Charity Ngilu has broken her silence over her political stand and indicated that she intends to join CORD. Speaking during the burial of Chama Cha Uzalendo party leader Wavinya Ndeti&#39;s husband in Machakos County at the weekend, Ms Ngilu however said she wanted to join the opposition coalition as a co-principal and urged the CORD luminaries to create space for her. During the funeral, the former Lands cabinet secretary sat in the front row with CORD principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&#39;ula. Mr Wetang&#39;ula said Ngilu was welcome to the coalition. &quot;We invite you to join us and help out our brother in (consolidating) Ukambani. I am happy you left the Jubilee cartels,&quot; Wetang&#39;ula said. And without being specific, Raila noted that there was space for &quot;others in the coalition and many were on the way coming&quot;.

Notably, Ngilu has been lambasting the Jubilee administration at all her political gatherings and is said to have developed a soft spot for CORD. A Narc MCA in the Kitui County Assembly who wished to remain anonymous said: &quot;Ngilu has never wanted to be a mere appendage in CORD and that is why she has been biding her time. She seriously wants to join the coalition but as an equal partner.&quot; Political pundits say should Ngilu join CORD, she will complicate the equation for the Kitui governorship, which has also attracted Kitui Senator David Musila who will be battling for the Wiper ticket against incumbent Julius Malombe.
