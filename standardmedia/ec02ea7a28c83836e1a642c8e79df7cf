Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has dispelled fears within CORD that he was being groomed to be Raila Odinga&#39;s running mate in next year&#39;s elections. He said he was campaigning countrywide to strengthen CORD and popularise Raila to face Jubilee in next year&#39;s polls but had no interest to be his running mate next year. &quot;I want to make it very clear that I will defend my seat as governor of Mombasa in 2017. ODM has already endorsed Raila Odinga as its presidential nominee and I urge Wiper and Ford Kenya to do so that their nominees can face Raila in the CORD nomination,&quot; Mr Joho said. He said this Thursday when he commissioned the construction of Shelly Beach Road and sanitation projects at Mwangala and Longo primary schools in Likoni Constituency. The estimated Sh1 billion project involves construction of toilet blocks and hand wash facilities for all the 94 public primary schools and is set to benefit over 70,000 pupils. The county has committed funds for 31 schools and is seeking donors for the remaining 63 schools.

This is discriminatory and it is why I have been critical of the Jubilee administration,&quot; Joho said. He claimed Jubilee has failed to initiate meaningful development projects in CORD strongholds.
