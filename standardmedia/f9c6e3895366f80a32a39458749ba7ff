KAKAMEGA: Budalang&rsquo;i MP Ababu Namwamba has expressed confidence that his supporters will re-elect him on Labour Party of Kenya (LPK) ticket in next year&#39;s polls. Speaking in his constituency Saturday for the first time since he became LPK leader, Namwamba reiterated that his political outfit has space, respects democracy and it will give him a better opportunity to perform in the political arena. &quot;I have overwhelming support in Budalang&rsquo;i and I know my electorates often vote for me with good reasons. I am really looking forward to 2017 so that we can send a strong political message to those who think I am joking,&#39;&#39; said Namwamba during the Bunyala Sub-County Education Conference in Budalang&rsquo;i. The legislator stated that his constituents have been part of his decision-making and noted that he consulted them before joining LPK. &quot;My voters have stood by me. I want to tell them I am on the right position and I will continue to serve them. After 2017 major political realignments will emerge and LPK is planning to be a big player when that time comes,&#39;&#39;. Namwamba added that LPK is not a western party and pointed out that it has officials nationwide. He also told off critics who claim Busia is an Opposition stronghold.

Stronghold of a party depends on the people. We are the ones who make a party popular. ODM was once popular in Rift Valley but that is not the situation at the moment,&#39;&#39; he noted. LPK will hold a national delegates conference in December to announce if they will pitch a presidential candidate or whoever they will be backing. &quot;In December LPK will make public if it will be putting up a presidential candidate and if not it will be in the best interests of Kenyans to inform them which presidential candidate LPK will rally behind,&#39;&#39;. Namwamba asked the government to speed up the process of identifying new IEBC commissioners in a bid to adequately prepare for next polls. &quot;As LPK we want a new IEBC to oversee elections in a free and fair manner. The current commissioners are exiting with serious trust deficit,&#39;&#39;.
