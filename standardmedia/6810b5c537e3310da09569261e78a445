KTN&#39;s Asha Mwilu and cameraman Rashid Idi were crowned overall winners of the CNN&nbsp; Multichoice African Journalist of the Year Awards 2016. The Standard duo were ranked best among 38 finalists at a colourful gala after winning the News Impact category of the continent&rsquo;s most prestigious award. Asha who is the features and documentaries editor at KTN News bagged the award alongside her cameraman Idi with a story investigating the terror activities in Mandera and its border with Somalia, Terror Crossing. On a night that women journalists dwarfed their male counterparts, Asha used the moment to urge lady journalists to avoid the perception of soft news. &quot;I am elated at winning this prestigious award and I thank my mum who always stood by me as I worked on the stories. I want to thank my colleagues at KTN and SG newsroom, Wellington Nyongesa and the video editors who made it possible for the entry to win,&quot; said Asha after the win. Idi dedicated the win to his family and asked camera crew to always give their work the best attention. Standard Group CEO Sam Shollei who was at the gala congratulated the duo and announced the media house was keen on breaking new ground in journalism in Africa with unrivalled content. &quot;We want to be the journalism power house in Africa by investing in talent and delivering quality journalism to our audiences,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shollei said on the sidelines of the gala that attracted media executives from the continent. The gala at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Johannesburg was attended by CNN Vice President for Content Sales and Partnerships Greig Beitchman and a host of top journalists from the continent.
