Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua Saturday wound up his three-day tour across the country with a public rally in Embu town. The Governor has been on a mission to popularise his Maendeleo Chap Chap party, which he says is geared to faster, efficient and quality service delivery. He urged political leaders to be accountable to the electorate based on their development record. He also observed that Kenyans pay heavy taxes to cater for leaders&#39; fat remunerations saying: &quot;It is mwananchi who pays them, and even cater for their medical covers among other benefits, yet the same Kenyan cannot access similar medical benefits.&quot; Maendeleo Chap Chap is seeking to have citizens access the rights to proper health and infrastructure. He regretted that whereas at the time of Mzee Jomo Kenyatta&#39;s death, the country was at par with Singapore and South Korea, &ldquo;we have since lagged behind because of bad politics. The time for poverty politics is gone. It is time for development,&quot; he said.
