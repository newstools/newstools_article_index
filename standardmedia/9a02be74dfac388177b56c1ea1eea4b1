The Maa community has already started scouting for its next kingpin following the death of former Cabinet Minister William ole Ntimama. Samburu county leaders are optimistic that the next leader will be chosen on merit, based on their development record. Nominated Senator Naisula Lesuuda said the title should be earned and not imposed. &quot;As the Maa community, we will sit down and have a conversation from which we will decide on who should sit on that throne,&quot; she said. Samburu North MP Aloise Lentoimaga said the next leader should have the community&#39;s interests at heart as was demonstrated by the late Ntimama. &quot;He was in the forefront in fighting for the rights of the Maa people. He was a true land rights activist and we would prefer a spokesperson who matches his deeds,&quot; said Mr Lentoimaga.
