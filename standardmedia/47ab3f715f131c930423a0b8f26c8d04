Baringo: Medical equipment at Kabarnet County Hospital is awaiting the commissioning of a Sh38 billion medical equipment distributed by the national government last year. Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi denied claims that he ordered the hospital not to use the machines until they are launched by the President Uhuru Kenyatta. Through his Communication Director Tom Tubei, the governor said installation of the equipment was on going and will be ready for utilization by patients in the next two weeks. "The construction and repair of some building to host the expensive machines will be completed in the next two weeks and the equipment will be operationalized," Tubei said. He added that a consultant was already testing the machines ready for usage. "Part of the equipment was already in use and a consultant is almost through updating the rest," said Tubei. The facility has X-ray and dialysis machines, a theatre, incinerators, sterilising units complete with surgical sets, a CT scan unit and assorted cancer treatment machines, but patients are yet to benefit from them. "I recently visited the hospital for a CT scan but I was shocked to be told to go elsewhere. The nurse only said instructions from the governor were that nobody should touch anything until the President commissioned the equipment," said Eunice Cheptoo. This forced her to travel 136km to Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital in Nakuru for a test she could have done less than three kilometres from her Kapropita home. Kalya Stephene, the hospital's medical superintendent, confirmed that there were under-utilised machines, adding that training and sourcing of experts was underway. "Everything depends on the presidential diary but the governor is the best person to explain. I know it will be anytime next month," she said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
