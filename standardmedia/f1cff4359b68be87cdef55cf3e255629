A doctor linked with the international terror network Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was yesterday arrested in Malindi, Kilifi County. A multi-agency security team mounted a crackdown at the doctor&#39;s home at Seat Breeze area near Malindi Hospital mortuary in Malindi town. Police said they recovered unnamed material from the 35-year old doctor attached to the Malindi hospital during the operation. Matawa Muchangi, the acting Kilifi county police commander, confirmed the arrest, saying the suspect was an accomplice of two medical interns -- Mohamed Shukri Yerrow and Abdulrazak Abdinuur -- who were arrested at the hospital in August in connection with ISIS. &quot;Acting on information, a multi-agency team raided a house at 2am and arrested the doctor suspected to be involved in terrorism activities,&quot; he said. The suspect was with his family. Mr Muchangi said the suspect had escaped a police dragnet when the two medical students were arrested. He declined to disclose where the suspect was being held and when he would be arraigned in court.
