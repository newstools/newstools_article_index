A second year student at Maseno University stunned a Kisumu court after she pressed for withdrawal of rape charges against her fourth year colleague. The expectant student, (name withheld) walked into the magistrate&#39;s court in Kisumu yesterday afternoon and requested&mdash;for the second time&mdash;that the case against the accused be withdrawn. She said she had forgiven him. Principal Magistrate Thomas Obutu withdrew the case that could have earned her alleged tormentor a life sentence. The woman had accused&nbsp; fourth year student of raping her on December 13, 2015 at around 3pm at Maseno near Athanas hostels in Kisumu West Sub-County and infecting her with HIV. He was arrested three days later. The charge sheet read that the accused had sex with the complainant, while knowing that he had HIV, which causes&nbsp; Aids. However, the woman told The Standard later that after that she tested HIV negative immediately after withdrawing the case.
