At least 20 students enrolled at the newly established Sango Polytechnic in Trans Nzoia County will have their one-year school fees paid for. County Education Chief Officer John Meng&rsquo;wa said his office will pay for the students for showing interest in the college in Kinyoro Ward, despite challenges in raising fees for their chosen courses. He said the decision was also inspired by willingness, support and goodwill by parents, besides the high poverty index in the area. Meng&#39;wa said the action is anticipated to encourage hard work, as well as boost enrollment. He said, however, the government cannot fees for every student and the County Government has a scheme that only caters for part of it. He urged students and their parents to strive and raise tuition fees. READ MORE Ministry should listen to teachers
