Jostling for the Opposition&#39;s presidential mantle took centre-stage as two CORD co-principals took their campaigns to different parts of the country. Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula was in Narok County where he asked his ODM counterpart Raila Odinga to step down and be the &#39;King Maker&#39;. And the Wiper Democratic Movement top brass warned ODM leaders against threats to go it alone in the 2017 elections if Raila was not endorsed as CORD presidential flag bearer. Addressing a well-attended political rally at the historic Tononoka grounds last evening, the party declared that Kalonzo Musyoka was best suited to be CORD&#39;s flag bearer. Wiper also took issue with some declaration by a section of ODM leaders saying they were divisive and underrated their party. &quot;We are deeply concerned about the sentiments in the past few weeks by ODM leaders that the party was ready to go it alone. The kind of chest-thumping that it is the biggest party is not acceptable. I want to tell them that Wiper has its options,&quot; Wiper chairman David Musila warned.

He should now let someone else give it a try,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula. He added: &quot;He (Raila) should be a king maker and he will have a special place in CORD once we win. After all, a king maker is more important than the king himself.&quot; In Mombasa, Senator Hassan Omar read out Wiper&#39;s Tononoka declaration endorsing Kalonzo as the most suitable candidate for State House within the CORD family. In the declaration, Wiper pledged to ensure a 50-50 government in respect of gender balance and end tribalism in the public sector. Kalonzo said he has made commitment and sacrifices &quot;like a pig&quot;, backing former President Mwai Kibaki after the 2007 polls and Raila&#39;s 2013 presidential bid, adding that he was ready to co-operate with anybody who would ensure CORD formed the next government.
