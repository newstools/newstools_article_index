Port-au-Prince:&nbsp;The number of people killed by Hurricane Matthew in Haiti rose to at least 478 people on Friday, as information trickled in from remote areas previously cut off by the storm, officials said. With the numbers rising quickly, different government agencies and committees differed on the total death toll. A Reuters tally of deaths reported by civil protection officials at a local level confirmed 478 had died. Haiti&#39;s central civil protection agency, which takes longer to collate numbers, said 271 people died because of the storm. Some 61,500 remain in shelters, the agency said. &nbsp; &nbsp; READ MORE Hurricane Matthew closes in on Florida as Haiti death toll rises Death toll rises to 140 as Hurricane Matthew strengthens approaching US Hurricane Matthew slams into western Haiti with deadly waves
