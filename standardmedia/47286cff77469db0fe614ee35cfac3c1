Jubilant residents of Chemolingot in Baringo broke into song and dance on Sunday afternoon, as the Pokot community celebrated its first ever female medical doctor in Tiaty, Jane Kukat. Not restricted by their ages, the old and the young hit the ground almost simultaneously despite conflicting musical rhythm to shower their daughter, sister and friend with songs of praise and thanksgiving upon her return from a foreign land. Recently, Dr Kutat was awarded a bachelor&#39;s degree in Medicine and Surgery by the University of Istanbul Ceraphasa Medical School in Turkey after seven years of academic struggle and determination. The 26-year-old and fourth born in a family of nine, was born and brought up in Chemolingot where she attended Chemolingot and Kimalel Primary Schools before proceeding to Kapropita Girls&#39; High School where she scored an A (minus). &quot;I am grateful to God and my parents. The going was tough and at some point I thought of letting it go but the poverty level back at my home constituency encouraged me to soldier on,&#39;&#39; said Dr Kukat. Seven years ago, she was lucky to secure a scholarship to Turkey and becomes the first female medical doctor in Tiaty and the second in the vast Pokot region after the late Cabinet Minister Francis Lotodo&#39;s daughter. To appreciate roles played by the community in transforming her life, Dr Kukat&#39;s focus is set towards struggle to liberate her community and girls like her from the yoke of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). &quot;It will be misleading to say I am the only bright girl from this region. Scores of very bright girls who could have freed our people from poverty have been forcefully circumcised and married at a tender age. This is what I want to confront,&#39;&#39; she told the crowd. Senior political figures from the community led by Prof John Lonyang&#39;apuo graced the colorful thanksgiving ceremony at Chemolingot Full Gospel Church that was presided over by Rev Symon Kiuta. &quot;You have made our community proud. Other communities like in Central Kenya had such celebrations in 1920s but with determination, this community is soon going to catch up with the rest,&#39;&#39; said Prof Lonyang&#39;apuo.

Everyday, I hear through the news on terrorist turning on innocent citizens in Turkey and thank the almighty for protecting my daughter,&quot; said the father. During the rare ceremony, Silale MCA Nelson Lotela brought the event to a standstill after narrating on how a mother of four and a board member at Chemolingot Secondary school allegedly went through the cut recently and accused the administration for facilitating the illegal practice. &quot;Several girls are brought daily to Chemolingot County Hospital for treatment after over bleeding. Those attending to them are government employees and claims that those involve cannot be arrested is untrue,&#39;&#39; said Lotela.
