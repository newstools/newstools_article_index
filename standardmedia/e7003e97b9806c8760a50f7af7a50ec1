Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet was yesterday&nbsp;ordered&nbsp;to appear in&nbsp;court&nbsp;to&nbsp;explain&nbsp;why he had not effected an arrest warrant against a litigant. Lady Justice Janet Mulwa said that the&nbsp;IG&nbsp;should appear at the Nakuru High&nbsp;Court&nbsp;to&nbsp;explain&nbsp;why he had not obeyed&nbsp;court&nbsp;orders&nbsp;despite being served with the arrest warrant which he signed to confirm he had received it. The&nbsp;court&nbsp;had&nbsp;ordered&nbsp;the arrest of&nbsp; the Director of Pensions Shem Nyakutu because he had failed to come to&nbsp;court&nbsp;to report when retired teachers would be paid their pension arrears as directed by the&nbsp;court. Nyakutu was expected to inform the&nbsp;court&nbsp;when the payment would be made. The&nbsp;court&nbsp;had in August&nbsp;ordered&nbsp;retired teacher&nbsp; be paid within 30 days. The Director of Pensions had informed the&nbsp;court&nbsp;that his office had received Sh1.5 billion, which is part of the Sh43.2bilion claimed by the retired teachers. An arrest warrant was issued when Nyakutu failed to show up in&nbsp;court&nbsp;to give the progress report.
