Two rebel ODM MPs from western region have launched a scathing attack on party leader Raila Odinga. Touring the Coast region, Budalang&#39;i MP Ababu Namwamba and his Sirisia counterpart, John Waluke, likened Raila&#39;s support in the region as &quot;crucifixion for long&quot;. The two attended the launch of the Federal Alliance Party of Kenya, founded by Ganze MP Peter Shehe on Saturday after holding discussions with fellow ODM rebel, Gideon Mung&#39;aro, in Mombasa. The MPs said they will tour Mombasa and Kwale to popularise the ideals of their &#39;Third Force and Mulembe Alliance&#39; that seeks to achieve the political unity of ethnic Luhya people. The Budalang&#39;i MP admitted meeting Mr Mung&#39;aro &quot;only briefly in Mombasa&quot; although initial reports indicated Ababu and Mr Waluke met the pro-Jubilee Kilifi North MP in Kilifi town before the two were hosted by Mr Shehe, who is Mr Mung&#39;aro&#39;s key ally in Ganze. In scathing and thinly-veiled attacks, Ababu described unnamed Opposition leaders as &quot;prophets of false hope&quot; and &quot;agents of violence and division of our people&quot;.

On Saturday, the two western MPs met leaders they described as ODM defectors from Taita Taveta, Tana River, Mombasa and Kwale counties. Saturday&#39;s programme for the party launch in Ganze listed Mr Mung&#39;aro and several former MPs as speakers, but the Kilifi North MP did not turn up. &quot;I am the one who has made someone go to Western for five days because there is a wind of change. It does not matter how many trips he makes,&quot; Ababu said referring to Raila&#39;s recent tours of Western, including his constituency in the wake of his rebellion. Ababu claimed Raila had controlled his supporters in Nyanza &quot;with an iron fist&quot; and argued that the Luhya people had a right to organise themselves as a community. He accused Raila of misleading voters in Coast and Western regions. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
