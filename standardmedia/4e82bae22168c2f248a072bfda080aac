Kenya: Local and international rights groups have called for an inquest into extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearance cases. The 13 human rights organisations also want those&nbsp; suspected to bear criminal responsibility brought to justice. They said they have documented over 300 cases of individuals who mysteriously disappeared while in the hands of security agencies since 2009, some of whom were found dead. &ldquo;Enforced disappearances are widespread and a dark stain on the fabric of law enforcement in Kenya that can only be addressed by bringing to account those suspected of responsibility through fair trials,&rdquo; Independent Medico-Legal Unit (IMLU) Executive Director Peter Kiama said. Kiama, who spoke in Nairobi yesterday during celebrations to mark the the International Day of the Disappeared, however said fair trials cannot take place without prompt, impartial and effective investigations. Many of the enforced disappearances happened during crackdowns on perceived members or sympathisers of Al-Shabaab.

Amnesty International Country Director Justus Nyang&rsquo;aya wants Kenya ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. &ldquo;Kenya must ratify this convention without making any reservation so as to end impunity and protect human rights.&rdquo; They cited recent High Court&nbsp;findings that lawyer Willy Kimani and his two associates were subjected to enforced disappearance and later executed by police.
