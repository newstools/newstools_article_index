For John Wainaina Karamba, August 1, 2012 will forever remain etched in his mind. This is the day that the lorry driver&rsquo;s life took an expected turn after he was involved in a road crash. The accident left the 48-year-old man from Icaciri village in Gatundu South with serious spinal cord injuries which saw him become paralysed and unable to walk. Mr Karamba, who was the only bread winner for the family, embarked on a journey to seek medical attention, with high hopes that he would be back on his feet and even resume his job. But four years later, Karamba is still unable to walk.
