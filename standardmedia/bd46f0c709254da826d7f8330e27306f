A teen is admitted at the Meru Referral and Teaching Hospital after a group of men cut off his arms in Northern Meru. Speaking from his hospital bed yesterday, Stanley Kinoti, 17, said that he was headed to the market, when a local tycoon and his sons accosted him, placed his hands on a post and cut them off. &quot;I was on my way to Mutuate market when the three called me by name and got hold of me, saying they wanted to cut off my head or hands,&quot; he said. He continued: &quot;The boys grabbed me as their father cut my head, then he asked his sons to cut off my hands. They also removed my trousers and left me on the road,&quot; said Kinoti who hails from Mutuate, Igembe North Sub-County. He also suffered head injuries.
