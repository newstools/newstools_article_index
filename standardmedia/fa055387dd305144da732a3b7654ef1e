The county government has embarked on transforming Maua town into a city by 2035. A major stakeholders&#39; forum held in the busy 24-hour town Friday took stock of available land for expansion of infrastructure and opportunities for setting up industries. The forum brought together players from the county government, the private sector and residents&#39; associations. &nbsp;Land, Planning and ICT Chief Officer Martin Gikunda said the big number of businesses mainly supported by miraa farming had resulted in good revenue and the money could be pumped back to the town&#39;s economy. &quot;We will identify in which areas to set up commercial and residential areas, as well as industries,&quot; said Gikunda. He said the county government was keen on building partnerships with local and international investors to inject new money into the town.
