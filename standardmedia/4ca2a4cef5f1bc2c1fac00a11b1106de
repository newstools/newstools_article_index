A few years ago, a Nakuru judge dismissed a defamation suit filed by a politician against&nbsp;The Standard&nbsp;for calling him a &#39;serial defector&#39;. The judge argued this couldn&#39;t be defamatory because defection in many aspects had been proven to be a &#39;smart career move&#39;. Defection, which is the act of either changing party allegiance due to ethnic considerations or the trading of party membership for many types of gains including cash and job offers, has evolved in Kenya over the years. In Kanu&#39;s reign, defection would not be complete without a ceremony led by the President to welcome the defector into the party. Questions were asked about what motivated the defection, and speculation included bribery with briefcases stuffed with cash. Of course, the talk of a swap of party membership cards for briefcases would not feature in the Opposition, including when Health minister Mwai Kibaki stealthily left Kanu on Boxing Day.

Of course, the difference in this form of &#39;defection&#39; springs from the fact that the &#39;defector&#39; already has his party and only uses it to determine his shareholding in the coalition being crafted. President Mwai Kibaki came up with something called &quot;Government of National Unity&#39;, headlined by formation of Cabinet and sharing of positions with other parties. When Mr Kibaki came up with this concept, the first beneficiaries were Simeon Nyachae&#39;s Ford-People and the then Kanu chairman, Uhuru Kenyatta. Mr Kenyatta had before that thrown a tantrum arguing that Mr Kibaki was an &quot;eyes off, ears off, everything off&quot; President. In short, Mr Kibaki was in sleeping mode! Today, less than six years later, Mr Kenyatta is in the final year of his term and he is confident he will be re-elected next year, and thereafter in 2022, he will hand over power to his Deputy William Ruto. To achieve this dream, the two leaders have chosen the beaten path of defection, albeit with some &#39;digital finesse&#39;. First, market the amalgamation of parties, especially those with strong ethnic roots, to form one strong monolithic engine, by calling it an act of magnanimity and of national interest. Here, they are argue, they are out to help the country kill tribalism by reducing the parties to two or three dominant ones like in the US. Secondly, they placate the communities targeted using the freebies exclusively in the hands of the Executive such as resources for roads, electricity, water and hospitals. This is made to look more like a &#39;gift&#39; than a right of the citizens and in turn, they are expected to reciprocate by joining and voting Jubilee. Also, the political spin-masters argue it is a &#39;sin&#39; not to be in Government and so make it look like a bus that can carry the whole nation. Of course in this bus, there is no paying passenger, yours is just to jump in and enjoy the ride. Those who may not be in the winning troupe are considered to have chosen to remain in the &#39;cold&#39;. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
