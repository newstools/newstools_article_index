Jubilee Party&#39;s Nairobi gubernatorial aspirants have been urged not to panic and attempt to bring down each other. Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa encouraged the hopefuls to instead focus on unseating Governor Evans Kidero and not tearing down each other. Speaking yesterday after a meeting with religious leaders, Wamalwa said there is no need to worry, as more aspirants jostle to fly President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s JP; saying the public will have the last say during nominations. &quot;All the Jubilee candidates should be allies. It does not add any value when the candidates spread propaganda about their colleagues, or attempt to disrupt meetings,&quot; said Wamalwa. Although he has not formally declared his interest for the seat, CS Wamalwa has also received endorsement from a section of city and Central Kenya MPs allied to the party, led by Kabete lawmaker Ferdinand Waititu. The endorsement has triggered mixed reactions, with some competitors and their supporters vocally opposing Wamalwa&#39;s bid, noting that he is an &#39;outsider&#39; and a project of some senior politician.

Realignments have also been formed among the aspirants, with some ganging up against the former Saboti MP. But Wamalwa yesterday lashed out at his critics, noting that they should concentrate on selling their bid and popularising JP, instead of attacking him.
