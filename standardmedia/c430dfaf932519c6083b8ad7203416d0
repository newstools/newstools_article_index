CORD co-principal Moses Wetang&#39;ula has said he will only accept a fair nomination process in picking the Opposition coalition presidential candidate. Mr Wetang&#39;ula also accused Opposition leader Raila Odinga&#39;s Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) of double-speak in the running of the coalition, saying his party would not be cowed by members of the Orange party. The Bungoma senator said it would be ironical for the coalition that has fought for the replacement of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries (IEBC) bosses to hold an unfair process for its flagbearer. He, however, termed reports that he was planning to ditch the coalition as propaganda, saying he was in the coalition to stay and would face Raila and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. &quot;We are three principals in CORD and whoever will win fairly we will support him. But if you win unfairly we will not accept because we cannot ask IEBC to be fair in elections and yet cannot do the same in our coalition,&quot; Wetang&#39;ula told a press briefing at Ford Kenya headquarters in Nairobi yesterday. He said the three partners have to work together to ensure that CORD uproots President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, from power.

Yesterday, Wetang&#39;ula was endorsed by Ford Kenya Women League as the party presidential candidate for the 2017 General Election.
