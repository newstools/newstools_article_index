Security along the busy Makutano-Sagana highway will improve with the opening of an Administration Police Camp at Riandira market, Kirinyaga County Commissioner Erastus Ekidor has said. He said highway robberies are common between Makutano market and Sagana town and that affects business. He added that with the camps now operational, such acts will reduce significantly. He was speaking at Riandira market during the opening of the camp by the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Samuel Arachi. &ldquo;The government is committed to ensuring all Kenyans operate in safe environments,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This section of the road is such an important one to the economy since it is part of the Great North Road which links Kenya with Ethiopia and runs all the way down from Cape Town to Cairo.&rdquo;
