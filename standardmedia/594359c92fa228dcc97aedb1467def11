The students, who started reporting last week, have been admitted to the institution&#39;s four colleges, with new students for two other colleges; Humanities and Social Sciences and the College of Education and External Studies set to report in January,2017. Those who reported are from the colleges of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences, Architecture and Engineering, Biological and Physical Science and that of Health Sciences. Speaking during the orientation of the first year students, Vice Chancellor Peter Mbithi advised them to be humble and maintain discipline as they focus on their education. Prof Mbithi noted that with the different cultures in the institution, the newfound freedom, and the university&#39;s location in the country&#39;s capital, the students will need to be disciplined and make wise choices. &quot;For most students, university is the first real experience of freedom; freedom of intellect, freedom of expression and all other freedoms. I urge you to exercise these freedoms responsibly,&quot; said Mbithi.
