The disputed ownership of a 22.5-acre piece of land at the Coast threatens to kick up a storm between the County Government of Mombasa and the national government representative at the Coast, Regional Co-ordinator Nelson Marwa. Already, policemen are said to have been deployed to the piece of land, perhaps to forestall clashes that could easily erupt, given the raised political temperatures. On Monday this week, Mr Marwa threatened to arrest Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho after county government workers brought down a perimeter wall erected by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), which has laid claim to the piece of land under dispute. The Mombasa Lands executive has clarified that the matter is before court for arbitration. For the two leaders to inflame public feelings over a matter that is before court is injudicious. Interference in matters that have been presented before court should not be encouraged; all the more reason why leaders at the Coast should hold their horses and await the court&rsquo;s ruling. Public spats among leaders do not aid the building of the much-sought-after national healing and cohesion. As such, it is in the best interest of all parties to exercise caution.
