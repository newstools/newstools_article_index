A civil society group has asked families of the three women killed in a foiled attack at the Central Police Station to claim the bodies. The lobby, Haki Africa, yesterday said the charred bodies at the Coast general Hospital Mortuary have remained unclaimed since Sunday when the women were killed. Reports now indicate all the women lived and schooled in Majengo area of Mombasa and some of their relatives have been questioned. It is not clear whether the State has allowed relatives to claim the bodies.
