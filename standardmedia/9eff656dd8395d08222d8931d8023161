The Government has been challenged to eradicate rabies which kills an estimated 2,000 people in Kenya annually. Kenya Veterinary Association said these are too many deaths from a disease that is preventable. Association chairman Dr Samuel Kahariri said most victims are the poor and marginalised. Kahariri spoke ahead of the 10th Rabies Conference and World Rabies Day to be marked in Mombasa starting today. At least 60,000 people around the world die from rabies annually.
