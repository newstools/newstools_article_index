President Barack Obama says that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump&#39;s comments on a 2005 videotape about groping women would disqualify him from even a job at a convenience store. Speaking at a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Obama said the choice was clear in the Nov. 8 election even before the tape was leaked last week showing Trump speaking crudely about women. &quot;Now you find a situation in which the guy says stuff that nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven,&quot; Obama told the crowd, referring to the convenience store chain. Trump said during Sunday night&#39;s presidential debate he was embarrassed by the video, but dismissed it as &quot;locker room talk.&quot; &quot;The fact that now you&#39;ve got people saying: &#39;We strongly disagree, we really disapprove ... but we&#39;re still endorsing him.&#39; They still think he should be president, that doesn&#39;t make sense to me,&quot; Obama said. Earlier on Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the remarks in the recording amounted to sexual assault.
