(Photo: Collins Oduor/Standard) Nyando Member of Parliament Fred Outa has vowed to help build bathrooms and concrete seats in Kisumu Central Police Station cells where he was held for 16 hours last week. The MP revealed that he had to go without bathing for the two days he was in the cells, and had to sit on the cold cemented floor the entire period, denying him comfort. Outa had been arrested for allegedly inciting Ahero Girls&#39; Secondary School students to violence as they protested against the interdiction of their principal Sarah Odipo, and had been booked at the station at 4pm on Tuesday and stayed till 8am on Wednesday when he was to appear in court. Even though he noted that the cells were a bit better compared to five years ago before the intensive judicial reforms, the second term MP said lack of seats was an issue which needed to be addressed. &quot;I had to sit down on the floor with nowhere to lean on. It was quite uncomfortable and I discovered that most of the remandees complained of back-aches due to the sitting position,&quot; said Outa.

According to the legislator, the remandees are just suspects who have not been convicted, and needed to be treated with dignity.
