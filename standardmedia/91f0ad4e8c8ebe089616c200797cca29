&nbsp; The High Court has suspended implementation of the new Traffic Rules. Infrastructure Cabinet Secretary James Macharia gazetted the new fines for minor traffic offences on September 23. Under the rules, failure to renew, carry or produce a driving license would cost Sh1,000, and driving a vehicle without an affixed identification plate in the prescribed manner will attract a Sh10,000 fine. Failure to obey a uniformed traffic officer&#39;s verbal or signal instructions would cost Sh3,000 and Sh5,000 if the driver fails to stop when required to do so. Driving a vehicle without a valid inspection certificate would force you to part with Sh10,000. Also, a commercial vehicle without the prescribed speed governor would attract a fine of Sh10,000; and not having a fire extinguisher Sh2,000. A fine of Sh2,000 had been imposed for driving while on phone.

But the Kenya National Union of Co-operatives Staff (KNUCS) went to court arguing that the rules are unconstitutional and went against the principle of fair trial. The union blamed the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) for the sorry status of the country&#39;s road transport. Judge Roselyn Aburili suspended the rules until the case is heard and determined, and directed NTSA not to charge the new fines. The matter will be heard on November 7.
