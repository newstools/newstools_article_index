More schools are investing in a new toilet technology that replaces the traditional pit latrines. EcoLoo, an odourless, sewage-free toilet that does not need flushing, can serve a school for over 10 years. The locally assembled toilets consist of an aerobic digester system through which fluid and solid waste is quickly separated and broken down by bacteria. In the process, the waste is turned into liquid organic fertiliser. The liquid fertiliser is odour-free, pathogen-free, safe to use and perfect for agriculture. It has a ventilation unit to ensure that the toilet remains odourless in the process of breaking down waste. The ventilation system includes a fan that uses wind power while the roof is made from translucent material that allows in adequate light. The technology seeks to address growing concerns about the sorry state of toilets in schools across the country. &nbsp;PHASED OUT At St Martin Deporress Primary School in Nairobi&rsquo;s Huruma estate, the new-look loos have phased out pit latrines. &ldquo;The children no longer go to the pit latrines we have. They would rather queue to use the Ecoloo,&rdquo; said Rhoda Kasubi, the headmistress. She said the new toilets had reduced the school&rsquo;s water and electricity budgets. The toilets do not need water and the translucent roofs let in enough light to rule out the need for an electric bulb. The new toilet is also more child-friendly than the accident-prone traditional pit latrines. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
