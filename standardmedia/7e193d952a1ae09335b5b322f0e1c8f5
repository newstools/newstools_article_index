A lawyer for an Afghan-born U.S. citizen charged with bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend asked a federal judge to schedule his first court appearance for Wednesday, possibly in his hospital bed. Ahmad Khan Rahami was arrested on Monday after a gunfight with police in Linden, New Jersey. He is now receiving treatment for his wounds at a Newark hospital, where he could formally face his charges if he cannot travel to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, his lawyer said. &quot;He has been held and questioned by federal law enforcement agents since his arrest,&quot; David Patton, head of the New York city federal public defenders office said in a court filing. &quot;The Sixth Amendment requires that he be given access to counsel on the federal charges, and that he be presented without delay.&quot; Patton also asked to meet with Rahami, 28, on Wednesday. Police also say they have not yet been able to interview Rahami. Federal prosecutors said Rahami injured 31 people in Manhattan&#39;s Chelsea neighborhood with a homemade bomb on Saturday night in a case that investigators now regard as terrorism. He is also charged with planting bombs that went off in Seaside Park, New Jersey, and his hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey, but did not injure anyone. He faces charges from federal prosecutors in both states.

Death to your oppression.&quot; The journal also praised slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, prosecutors said. The attacks were the latest in a series in the United States inspired by militant groups including al Qaeda and Islamic State. A pair of ethnic Chechen brothers killed three people and injured more than 260 at the 2013 Boston Marathon with homemade pressure-cooker bombs similar to those used in this weekend&#39;s attacks. In the past year, an Orlando gunman and a married couple in San Bernardino killed dozens in mass shootings inspired by Islamic State. The incidents inflamed the U.S. debate about security and immigration. Federal investigators were probing Rahami&#39;s history of travel to Afghanistan and Pakistan, and looking for any evidence that he may have been radicalized or trained in bomb-making on those trips. They still are trying to find out whether he received any help in planning his attack or building the bombs. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
