Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi (pictured) was on Thursday charged with forging academic documents. Mr Sudi appeared before the anti-corruption court where he faced three counts of forging academic certificates while seeking clearance from the electoral commission to contest his seat in 2013. The court heard that the accused committed the offence on January 31, 2013. The MP denied the charges and was released on a Sh300,000 cash bail. He reportedly forged the certificates he presented to Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) while seeking nomination for the March 4, 2013 elections. The MP has been accused of forging his diploma in business management allegedly issued by the Kenya Institute of Management as well as a Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education qualification reportedly issued by Highway High School. He faced another charge of giving false information to an officer of the IEBC. The court heard that he lied to both the electoral commission and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).
