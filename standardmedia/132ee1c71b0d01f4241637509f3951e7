The latest trend indicates that tourists prefer private lodging as opposed to beach hotels. The long tradition of tourists wanting to be near the ocean is on the decline as most of them opt for private apartments, villas and cottages. Trevors Field is a tourist from Australia who has been visiting Kenya frequently. He prefers luxury villas. &quot;I have been staying here for the last two years now and it is a good thing so far. It&#39;s friendly, private, nice, quiet, and the staff are friendly. I will definitely come back because I always come two to three times a year,&quot; said Mr Field, who stays at Diani Pearl Luxury Apartment. Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya said the county was attracting international recognition following Diani&#39;s recognition as the best beach destination three years in a row. &quot;Because of getting the recognition for three years consistently, and the peaceful stay that we have witnessed, most investors have come our way,&quot; he told The Standard yesterday.
