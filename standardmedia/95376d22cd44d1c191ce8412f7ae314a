The National Land Commission (NLC) has invested Sh350 million in digitisation processes to curb corruption. The commission said it was limiting physical contact between officers and clients. NLC chairman Muhammad Swazuri (pictured) said they were collaborating with the Ministry of Lands, which has spent Sh900 million to ensure that operations are digitised. &quot;The contact between service providers in the Lands registry and clients is the main cause of corruption. The central registry in Nairobi is fully ditgitised. Kajiado, Nakuru and Kericho counties are partly digitised,&quot; he noted. Dr Swazuri said his office wanted to deter Kenyans from going to Ardhi House and encourage them to access all land services through the internet. With the new system, Kenyans will be able to track what is happening with their applications online. They will also be able to follow the various stages of their applications. He said they already had tamper-proof lease certificates developed to eliminate double titling. &quot;The system is able to record the names of all those who work on a particular case,&quot; he explained.
