Senate will convene a special sitting tomorrow to debate the impeachment of Nyeri County Governor Nderitu Gachagua. The county assembly speaker had communicated the impeachment report to the senate on Monday. Impeachment motion against Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua sailed through last week Friday after MCAs garnered two-thirds majority. Gachagua impeachment was successful after 35 out of 47 MCAs voted in favor of his removal. The impeachment motion had been tabled amid previous unsuccessful attempts to reconcile the governor and the MCAs. Nyeri Senator Mutahi Kagwe had met both the Executive and the MCAs in an apparently failed attempt to iron out the differences.
