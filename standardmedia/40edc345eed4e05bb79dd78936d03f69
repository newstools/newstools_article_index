An Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) official has challenged the newly launched Jubilee Party to name its national officials. JP, on whose ticket President Uhuru Kenyatta will be seeking a second term, was officially launched in on September 10 but has not named substantive office bearers. It has instead named officials of the defunct Jubilee Alliance Party officials to run its affairs on an interim basis to avert infighting between officials of the folded party. &nbsp;ODM Director of Elections Junet Mohammed now claims that attempts by President Uhuru Kenyatta and deputy William Ruto to create a national outfit by folding 12 political parties have failed. He likened the running of Jubilee Party to the way Kenya&rsquo;s independent party, Kanu, was run during its reign. &ldquo;It is more than a month since Jubilee Alliance re-launched into a new Jubilee Party with much hype and drama,&rdquo; he said.

TRIBAL OUTFIT &ldquo;Yet just as happened at the re-launch, the new Jubilee Party remains without officials,&rdquo; said Mr Mohammed. He termed the new party a &ldquo;tribal&rdquo; outfit that cannot unite the country. Mohammed said just like Kanu, which did not have officials around 1969, JP has been in existence for a month without office bearers. &ldquo;Coming from the background of being a party of two communities, Jubilee is finding it impossible to translate itself into a mass movement bringing together all communities. &ldquo;The failure to name officials makes it clear that Uhuru and Ruto are unable to run a national outfit,&rdquo; he said. He asked Kenyans to ignore claims by Jubilee that it had transformed into a national movement for the unity of Kenyans. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
