The Government has given an Australian mining firm the go-ahead to explore for more minerals in the coastal region. Base Titanium is also awaiting a second licence after its application was approved by the licensing committee in the Ministry of Mining several months ago. The firm has been mining Titanium in Msambweni since Feb 2014. The areas to be explored include Ramisi, Majoreni and Vanga, which is in Lungalunga. According to Base Titanium General Manager Joe Schwarz, the company carried out an aerial geophysical survey in June last year which indicated&nbsp; potential for additional mineral sands occurrences. &quot;It is with this background that we applied for a prospecting licence where we now plan to drill to prove up or otherwise the existence and viability of additional resources,&quot; he said.
