The High Court has ordered the Orange Democratic Party and the Registrar of Political Parties to appear before it on October 25 for hearing on an alleged Sh5 billion pay default. The Raila Odinga-led party moved to court seeking to force the Registrar to disburse the political parties funds said to be owed to it. Justice Roslyn Aburili yesterday certified the case as urgent and ordered that both parties appear before her to argue their case. The party in its court papers claims its activities have stalled because of under-funding, despite it being the most popular party in the country. The Orange party argues it is entitled to receive at least 40 per cent of the funds distributed to political parties from the fund. The Registrar and the Treasury, according to ODM, have defied the law by failing to give reasons for not distributing the money.
