Three people were injured following running battles between the police and matatu touts. &nbsp;A man and a woman sustained gunshot wounds from stray bullets while a policeman was injured after he was pelted with stones by the touts. Chaos broke out at the main matatu stage and market on Wednesday afternoon when police officers on a mission to arrest a tout were repulsed by the rowdy touts. The close to one hour fracas brought business to a standstill. County Police Commander Charles Ontita said the tout had been accused of stoning and damaging vehicles at the matatu stage.
