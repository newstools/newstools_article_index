According to the new fines, driving a vehicle without a valid inspection certificate will force you to part with Sh10,000. Driving a public service vehicle without a certificate of qualification will attract an instant fine of Sh5,000. Failure to renew, carry or produce driving licence will cost Sh1,000, and driving a vehicle without the identification plate affixed or not fixed in the prescribed manner will attract a Sh10,000 fine.
