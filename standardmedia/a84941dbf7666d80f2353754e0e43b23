A Malindi court will on September 23 rule whether to dismiss a corruption case against Ganze MP Peter Shehe. The MP is charged with conspiracy to embezzle Sh40 million from the constituency development fund three years ago. The lawmaker wants the case dismissed, arguing that the prosecution abused the court process by preferring several charges under three separate files. Through his lawyer John Khaminwa, the MP told Chief Magistrate Charles Mbogo that the resignation of Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission boss Phillip Kinisu had also affected the case. Mr Shehe is charged alongside former CDF members Daniel Chiriba, Emanuel Sanga, Harrison Eyiende, Christopher Nyerere and officials of World Drone Company. They argue that the offences are the same and derived from the CDF Act and questioned the wisdom behind the separation of the charges.
