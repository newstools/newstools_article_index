West Pokot and Turkana leaders have asked the county administration to crack down on the&nbsp;&nbsp; production and consumption of illicit brews along their common border. The leaders want county and sub-county commissioners and chiefs to up their game and curb the consumption of&nbsp; illicit brews.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Led by Turkana South MP James Lomenen, the leaders said there has been a rise in the consumption of illicit brews. &ldquo;When people are drunk and idle they are likely to engage in fights,&rdquo; said the MP. &mdash;Irissheel Shanzu
