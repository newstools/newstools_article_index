KENYA: Police in Nakuru have launched a manhunt for a 38-year-old man who fled after allegedly killing his wife on Saturday night. According to their neighbours at Hilltop in London Estate, the man and his wife, 25, have been squabbling since they got married three months ago. &quot;He always accused his wife of cheating and we have been called several times to solve their issues,&quot; said Phoebe Wangui, a neighbour. Wangui said after beating her on Saturday night, the man fled early Sunday morning on realising that she was dead. &quot;I noticed there was blood on the doorstep in the morning. When I asked him, he said that everything was okay and took off in his bicycle,&quot; said another neighbour. Wangui said the suspect, a charcoal vendor, was seen in a local pub on Sunday morning before disappearing.
