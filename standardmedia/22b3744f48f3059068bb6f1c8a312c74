President Uhuru Kenyatta told Opposition leader Raila Odinga to keep off the affairs of the ruling coalition and mocked him, saying he would continue to salivate over power but wouldn&#39;t taste it just yet. The two exchanged verbal brickbats during the burial of veteran politician William ole Ntimama at his Narok home yesterday. Controversy and heated politics, which characterised Ntimama&#39;s life, followed him to the grave as Government and Opposition leaders turned his funeral service into a stage for political showdowns.&nbsp; After eulogising the former Narok North MP, the President told Raila off regarding his persistent attacks on his government and said he remained fully in charge while the Opposition salivated over the presidency that Jubilee wasn&#39;t about to surrender. &quot;I do not know how to talk politics at a funeral but I cannot let what my brother Raila said here go unchallenged,&quot; said Uhuru, apparently angered by Raila&#39;s remarks that the late Ntimama had called him to express his support for ODM despite leading a delegation of Maasai leaders to State House. &quot;Raila should desist from attacking Jubilee. Put your house in order,&quot; the President said, alluding to the tussling for the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) presidential ticket between Raila and his CORD co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang&#39;ula.

We are here to stay,&quot; said the President who went on: &quot;I recall when I was in Mombasa recently, a Swahili man said: &#39;Kumeza mate sio kula nyama,&#39;&quot; which means salivating over meat doesn&#39;t translate into eating meat. JUBILEE ISSUES The President told Raila to concentrate on putting his coalition in order instead of wasting time on Jubilee issues as he readied himself for next year&#39;s political battle. The Head of State, who was in the company of his political mentor - former President Daniel arap Moi, was reacting to claims by Opposition leaders that the Government was using State resources to lure Opposition politicians to the Jubilee camp. The merger of 12 political parties to form the Jubilee Party has ignited a scramble for the Maasai vote between Uhuru and Raila. Ntimama passed on a week after visiting the President at State House Nairobi, where he pledged to rally the Maa community to re-elect the President. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
