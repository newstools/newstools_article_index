MERU: The Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has agreed to relocate a public primary school located on land earmarked for Isiolo airport. Ministry of Transport Principal Secretary Irungu Nyakera said KK Nkengechia Primary School in Athwana ward of Tigania West sub-county will be relocated to a new site at the cost of Sh85 million. Mr Nyakera who was accompanied by KAA Managing Director Yatich Kangugo met teachers, pupils, parents and officials of the New Kiare Land Adjudication Committee and said funds for re-locating the school were available. The officials visited the school when they inspected the Sh2.7 billion airport whose construction is now in its second phase. The land committee officials led by former Muthara Ward Rep Bernard Muthaura said parents had donated the land early this year and urged KAA to hasten the construction. Mr Muthaura, however, clarified that the amount the school expects is Sh85 million, adding that the Sh70 million stated in the media was an old figure.
