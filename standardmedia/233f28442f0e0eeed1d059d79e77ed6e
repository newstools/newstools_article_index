Bungoma County government Secretary and Head of Public Service Murumba Chiuli has sued a local blogger for defamation. Through his advocate Paul Juma, Mr Chiuli has accused Simiyu Mutaki of maligning his image on social media. &ldquo;That on or about 14 September, you posted on a social media christened &lsquo; The County Flash&rsquo; words in reference to our client, claiming that he had an affair with a Congolese woman whom our client beat up because she denied him intimacy,&rdquo; read the letter, which further demands Mutaki to apologises within seven days. Chiuli has since appealed to his family and the public to remain calm as he initiates the legal process. -Titus Oteba
