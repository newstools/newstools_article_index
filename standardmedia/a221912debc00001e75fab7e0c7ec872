The miraa task force began its work yesterday. The 14-member team formed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, in consultation with Meru leaders, first held a meeting with the Njuri Ncheke Council of elders at their Nchiru shrine, in Tigania, on Monday. In a departure from tradition, four women were allowed at the shrine, which is normally out of bounds for women. &nbsp;Not even female journalists are allowed into the hallowed grounds when the elders call a press conference or are conducting other business. But on Monday the women sat with the Njuri elders from Meru, Tharaka Nithi and Isiolo counties, led by their regional chairman Linus Kathera and secretary general Josphat Murangiri. &ldquo;The matter that brings us here is of great importance, because it touches on the livelihoods of the entire community. That is why our first point of call is at the elders&rsquo; shrine, because we need their blessings as the gatekeepers of the community, and need their counsel too,&rdquo; said Lucy Kilemi, a task force member.

The task force is supposed to suggest ways to recover the lost markets and seek new ones. &ldquo;We will also identify initiatives, activities and interventions that will support development of miraa,&rdquo; Mr Muthuri said. The team is also expected to initiate research on miraa agronomy, variety improvement, product development and value addition. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
