ISTANBUL:&nbsp;An explosion thought to have been caused by a suicide bomber wounded at least seven people in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep on Sunday during a police raid on a suspected Islamic State safehouse, security and hospital sources said. Police pursued a vehicle thought to be carrying explosives to the house, where 7 or 8 Syrian nationals were believed to be sheltering, and raided it, the security sources said. Several of the seven people hospitalised were police officers, the hospital sources said. Turkey launched an incursion into Syria in August in support of Syrian rebels to try to push Islamic State from its border. The rebels said on Sunday they had captured the village of Dabiq from the jihadist group, a stronghold where it had promised to fight a final, apocalyptic battle with the West. A suicide bomber suspected of links to Islamic State killed more than 50 people, many of them children, at a Kurdish wedding in Gaziantep in August. It was the latest in a series of attacks by the radical Islamists on Turkish soil.
