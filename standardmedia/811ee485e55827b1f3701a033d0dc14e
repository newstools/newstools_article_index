As the countdown to the 2017 General Election begins, the race to unseat Governor Kinuthia Mbugua is taking shape. Already, three senior politicians are laying down their strategies to win the seat. The entry of former National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) chairman Lee Kinyanjui has thrown the&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;Party (JP) deeper into political dilemma, as all the aspirants including incumbent Mbugua, are eyeing its ticket. Kinyanjui, whose three-years at the helm of NTSA ended on September 28, says he asked the President not to renew his term so he could concentrate on campaigns. &ldquo;I have indicated to the President that I want to focus on launching my gubernatorial campaign. I have conducted an independent survey and my chances to unseat Governor Mbugua are high,&rdquo; he told The Standard on Sunday. Political observers are predicting a battle of the titans between Mbugua and his rivals, who so far include Kinyanjui, Senator&nbsp;James Mungai and Nacada chairman John Mututho.

The politician has been critical of Mbugua&rsquo;s administration, claiming the incumbent has failed to spur socio-economic growth. &ldquo;Mbugua&rsquo;s government has been riddled with allegations of corruption and non-performance,&rdquo; he said.
