Hundreds of commercial sex workers have flocked Thika town as the town prepares to host a major sporting event. Kenya Inter-County Sports and Cultural Association and County Assemblies Sports Association Games, which kick off today, will run up to Saturday. Thirty-nine counties have confirmed participation. About 20,000 staff from the counties,&nbsp;including governors, and over 100,000 fans are expected to attend. The sex workers drawn from all over the country have flooded the town to cash in on the high number of guests attending the annual event. One commercial sex worker from Nakuru town urged members of the public to stop judging them as they are working hard, like everyone else, to put the bread on the table. &ldquo;We are here to make money. These county officials normally have a lot of money at their disposal some of which they like to spend on women. Last year, we made some good money during similar games held in Uasin-Gishu County,&rdquo; she said on condition of anonymity. Local sex workers are however unhappy with their colleagues from other counties who they accuse of &ldquo;coming to spoil our opportunity&rdquo;, which they said they would not allow to happen. &ldquo;We will not allow them to ruin business for us here. It is our turn to eat and make money and we will not allow them to spoil the party for us. They should stay in their towns and do business from there,&rdquo; said Purity Wangui. Last week while handing over the national flag to the Kiambu team, Governor William Kabogo warned visitors to be wary of prostitutes who have flocked the town.
