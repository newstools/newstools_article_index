A class five pupil left her grandmother&rsquo;s house for Kenyatta University Primary School at 6am as usual on June 29. For four years, Sharon Makungu, 13, has used the train to get to school. But on this day, her journey would redefine her life forever. Makungu had both legs severed by the train. &ldquo;I was with three younger girls and I let them get onto the train first,&rdquo; says Sharon. &ldquo;It usually hoots three times to signal when it is about to leave, but on that day, it hooted only once. When I was climbing the stairs, the train started moving and I was hit by the door and fell, then it started running over me. I tried calling out but nobody heard my cry.&rdquo; The train severed both of her legs and three fingers from her right hand, and it was not until the train had passed that the station master saw her. An ambulance was called and railway staff rushed her to a hospital in Ruiru. She was referred to Thika Level 5 hospital, where doctors said her condition was too critical for them. She was rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) where she has been receiving treatment for the last three months before she was discharged on Tuesday. She has since moved out of her grandmother&rsquo;s house, where she had been living for one year, to live with her two younger siblings and mother in Kitambaa, Ruiru. Her mother, Jackline Muhongo, says Sharon&rsquo;s treatment has put a financial strain on the family.

If I leave her it makes her feel as if she has been imprisoned, with no one to help her move around,&rdquo; she adds. The case attracted the interest of Nominated MP Isaac Mwaura, who has been assisting the family since he heard about the incident. &ldquo;I am shocked by the callousness that a multi-national can show in relation to an innocent little girl,&rdquo;&nbsp; says Mwaura. &ldquo;Because even when they took her to hospital, they promised to pay the bill but did not.&rdquo; This, Mwaura said, was a clear case of an individual&rsquo;s negligence. &ldquo;At Ruiru, there is no proper train station and I am wondering if the case is that the train does not have any conductors who can give the signal for the train to move,&rdquo; he says. However, Rift Valley Railways denies the allegations and says they were not responsible for the accident. They gave a different version of the story, saying Sharon had been late that day and actually ran after the train after it had already started moving, tripped and fell and consequently got her limbs severed. Compensation push The firm says ticket collectors usually guard the door to ensure the pathway is completely clear before the train leaves, and that it hoots thrice as a warning, which it did that day contrary to what Sharon says.
