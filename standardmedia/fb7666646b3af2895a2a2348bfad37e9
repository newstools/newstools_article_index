Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has recorded a statement with police at DCI headquarters over a remark he made that he was the acting president. He presented himself before the DCI on Sunday and spent two hours before leaving at about 8pm. He denied the claims and said he had witnesses to back what he meant. The file will be taken to DPP Keriako Tobiko for action. Tobiko had ordered the probe.
