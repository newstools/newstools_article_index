Seven secondary school students have been arrested after police raided a house where they have been holding sex orgies for the past one week. Officers acting on a tip-off stormed the one-roomed house in Sofia House where they found the four boys and three girls from a boys&#39; and girls&#39; secondary schools in Ndhiwa. The students, who were still clad in their school uniforms when they were arrested on Wednesday evening, claimed they had been sent away from school over fee arrears. Eyewitnesses said the boys were five but one escaped during the raid. The students were first detained by boda boda operators who had become alarmed by their strange behaviour. &nbsp;&quot;I have been interacting with these students mainly to learn their behaviour. The boys confessed to me that they have been engaging in sex orgies in the house. They declined to tell us the owner of the house,&quot; said an area resident. One of the boys who arranged for the house to accommodate them asked his friend to offer him another room where the boys would stay during the day then join the girls at night.

Omusanga said they are liaising with the Children&#39;s Department to ascertain the proper modalities of charging them, saying they will be handled as minors.
