A man was slashed to death by his son during a quarrel over a packet of wheat flour in Mutheru village, Kandara sub-county in Murang&#39;a. Peter Kinyanjui Kago, 75, was slashed three times on Tuesday after he questioned his son about sneaking into his room to steal the flour. The man still depended on his father for provisions despite being allocated land with tea bushes for his sustenance. A 2kg packet of wheat flour sells at Sh150 locally. Close relatives said the elderly man spotted his son walking from his house and demanded to know what he was carrying. He grabbed him and a packet of wheat flour fell to the ground. Mary Waithira, the deceased&#39;s daughter, said she regretted buying her father the flour that later cost him his life. &quot;It is a shock that the gift I brought my father has caused his death,&quot; said Waithera who had travelled from her matrimonial home in Kangari to deliver the flour on Saturday.
