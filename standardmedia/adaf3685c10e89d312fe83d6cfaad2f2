Coast&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;and&nbsp;civil&nbsp;society&nbsp;have&nbsp;demanded&nbsp;a transparent investigation into the killing of a 16-year-old student by a policeman. They accused the police of covering up the murder. Tony Katana, a student at Harvard Secondary School in Nyali, Mombasa County was shot dead on August 12 in mysterious circumstances. Nyali Deputy OCPD Walter Abondo claimed the boy was a gang member and was killed after attacking police officers with a panga, but witnesses dispute this theory. Yesterday, rights activists said the investigation so far does not inspire hope and accused the Criminal Investigation Department of trying to sabotage a probe by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA). &ldquo;We are not sure whether a credible probe shall be conducted,&rdquo; said Hussein Khalid, Executive Director of Haki Africa. Khalid was referring to the tussle between the CID and IPOA on the custody of police fragments recovered from Katana&rsquo;s body early this week.

Police officers snuffed the boy and later seized exhibits to be used in the investigation of the suspect,&rdquo; he said. Joho accused police of using force to seize exhibits from IPOA. &ldquo;We shall not rest until we are told why this boy was killed,&rdquo; he declared. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
