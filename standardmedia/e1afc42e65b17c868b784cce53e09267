Having not set foot in his constituency for over a year now, Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno now faces the stiffest opposition ever. Regarded as one of Nyanza&rsquo;s most seasoned politicians, those who want to unseat him are pegging their arguments on two issues: his silence and a perceived fall out with the ODM party. Mr Otieno, who is serving his second term, came under fierce criticism when he unveiled a third force party dubbed &ldquo;Kalausi&rdquo;, which political observers claimed was meant to dilute ODM&rsquo;s hold in South Nyanza and challenge Raila Odinga&rsquo;s political base. The Kalausi movement came barely a year after he was elected on an ODM ticket. The MP was very instrumental in the ODM elections in 2013. Strong challenge Currently touted as a rebel, opponents have come out seeking his seat claiming that he has abandoned both the people and the party. Paul Abuor, who came second in 2013 and who defected from ODM to Tip Tip after losing the nominations to Otieno, has since re-joined the party. Mr Abuor has been close to top party leaders and on several occasions been seen with party chairman John Mbadi at events in the constituency. Otieno will also face a strong challenge from former Students Organisation of Nairobi University chairman, David Osiany&rsquo;. Mr Osiany&rsquo; has been roped into Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho&rsquo;s campaign for Raila 2017. It is rumoured that the ODM party is warming up to him to be the party&rsquo;s point man in Rongo. Osiany&rsquo; was seen in the company of Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and Mr Joho over the weekend, as some of the party&rsquo;s top leaders traversed different counties over the weekend. Defend seat Other names keen on the parliamentary seat include the county&rsquo;s attorney, Tom Kwanga, Erick Amuka, who is a bursar at a local secondary school, Ong&rsquo;ondo Ngani, accountant Ken Ocholla and George Oreng.
