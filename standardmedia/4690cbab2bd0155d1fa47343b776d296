Wrangles and political machinations in Jubilee Party strongholds have been blamed on a leadership vacuum at the top. Barely two weeks after President Uhuru Kenyatta launched JP, Mount Kenya leaders are engaged in vicious political battles to control the party.

Nandi Senator Stephen Sang said Rift Valley was waiting for the national officials to be unveiled before they pick interim officials at the counties. &ldquo;Once we have the county officials, we will then start mass recruitment of members. That (national officials) is what we are waiting for,&rdquo; Sang said. But this is in complete contrast to what is happening in Mt Kenya region. There is a rush by aspirants to arbitrarily open JP offices and declare themselves party officials in a bid to secure Jubilee tickets.

Kiraitu said that there was need to manage the party&rsquo;s affairs well so that &ldquo;the popularity that spread like wild fire across the country is harnessed and put into good use.&rdquo; Party branches GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
