The electoral agency has revised its timelines in efforts to meet some of the strict deadlines set by the recently-enacted poll laws. The new changes come as it emerged that some of the timelines set by the joint select committee on electoral reforms were arrived at without considering whether they can be achieved. In a document exclusively obtained by The Standard, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has shelved its plans to have mass voter registration in December, and instead pushed it to its initial February date. The commission had been requested to have the second mass listing in December to tap eligible schoolgoing youths. The exercise will now run from February 7, 2017 to March 9.

Initially, the exercise was to be conducted 14 days before June 9, 2017. &quot;The request by stakeholders to have the second phase of mass voter registration during December holidays is now not possible and the exercise will run in February-March as earlier planned,&quot; said the commission in the document. The commission has also pushed forward inspection of the register of voters to give room for the auditing of the voter register. The crucial exercise will now run from April 21 to May 21 for a period of 30 days. At the same time, IEBC will this week meet leaders from various political parties as it pushes for the changes as well as put in more efforts in its engagement with electoral players ahead of the August 8, 2017 polls.
