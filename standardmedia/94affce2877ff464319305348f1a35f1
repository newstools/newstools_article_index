Governor Kivutha Kibwana has unveiled an elaborate 10-year county development plan. The Vision 2025 Strategic Plan lays down development priorities for the county and a blueprint on how to achieve them. The plan identifies the main priorities for the county as water, education, healthcare, infrastructure, energy, food security, trade and value-added agriculture. The county government plans to invest more resources in primary healthcare to prevent common infectious diseases and tackle increasing cases of non-communicable diseases. Last month, Mr Kibwana launched a universal healthcare plan that will see county residents access free medical services in all public health institutions.The county also plans to double access to clean water by supplementing ongoing efforts to harvest surface water. &quot;The target is to reduce the average distance to water points from the current 8km to 3km and have at least 70 per cent of households access reliable water,&quot; he said. To fund the plan, the county government has lined up several initiatives including the establishment of a county revenue authority and county investment, marketing and promotion agency, as well as development of private-public partnerships. There are also plans to participate in regional economic blocs and establish a donor liaison desk. &quot;The vision embodies relevant components of sustainable development goals including the fight against poverty, hunger and food insecurity, illiteracy, inequality and disparities, climatic degradation and social conflicts,&quot; said the governor. The vision is tailored to address and counter challenges hindering county development.
