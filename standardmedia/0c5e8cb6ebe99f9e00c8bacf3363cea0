NAIROBI: Kenya&rsquo;s showing at the just concluded Paralympics games in Rio, Brazil reaffirms its position as a sporting powerhouse on the African continent. Kenya&rsquo;s haul of three gold, one silver and two bronze medals, emerging at position 34 complements our world-beating athletes who showed their class in the August 2016 Rio Olympics by bringing home six gold, six silver and one bronze medals despite all the challenges they encountered before setting off to Brazil. Our Paralympics team&rsquo;s impressive showing in Brazil keeps in tandem with the very pertinent truism that disability is not inability. They were able to overcome challenges to enhance Kenya&rsquo;s standing as a great sporting nation. There is every need to encourage our sports men and women by giving them incentives whenever they win us accolades. Success lays in advance preparation and harmony between the athletes and their officials. This aspect is seen to be lacking in the Kenyan context and the ministry charged with managing and improving sports should spare no effort to ensure our sportsmen and women are not only taken care of in emoluments, they must also have adequate training facilities at their disposal. To our Paralympics team, we say kudos, keep the flame burning. We are proud of you as patriotic Kenyans.
