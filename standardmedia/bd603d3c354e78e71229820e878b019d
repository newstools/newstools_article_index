Opposition and Jubilee politicians at the Coast have dismissed Budalang&#39;i MP Ababu Namwamba&#39;s recent tour of the region. Yesterday, Zadock Mbeya, a Ford Kenya official in Mombasa, accused Mr Namwamba of pursuing an ethnic agenda during his tour. Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi accused the Budalang&#39;i legislator of sneaking into his meeting. On Sunday, Namwamba walked into hostile crowds in Changamwe and left a meeting in a hurry after the crowds began to ask him to state why he was leaving ODM. But Namwamba billed his tour as a huge success and thanked Mr Mwinyi and Ganze MP Peter Shehe &quot;for being on hand to receive me in their respective constituencies&quot;. &quot;I am determined to build a strong following in the region at the expense of both Jubilee and CORD. The Federal Democratic Alliance (FDAK) becomes the first partner in our movement. Many more will come on board. The third force is real. Ignore it at your own peril,&quot; he said in a statement. He also thanked Sirisia MP John Waluke for accompanying him.
