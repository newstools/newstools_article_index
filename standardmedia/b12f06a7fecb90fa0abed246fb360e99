The Government has appointed officials to oversee the nationwide implementation of the Sh24 billion laptops for schools&#39; programme. A circular by Education Permanent Secretary Belio Kipsang&#39; to all the County Directors of Education says the 260 officers will spearhead and support the roll-out of the Digital literacy Programme (DLP) - popularly known as laptops programme &ndash; across the counties. Dr Kipsang said the Information and Communication Technology Authority (ICTA) has employed 60 assistant ICT officers who will be based at the county information offices. &quot;They will supervise the ICT quality inspectors at the sub-county offices,&quot; said Kipsang&#39; in a circular dated October 6, which was also copied to all sub-county directors of education and head teachers. He said an additional 200 Presidential Digital Programme interns will be deployed in sub-counties as ICT quality inspectors. &quot;Their role will be to undertake an e-readiness assessment in the schools within the sub-county and train teachers on basic ICT skills and the DLP class solution,&quot; said the PS. The interns will also conduct inspection and acceptance of equipment as delivered and installed by the respective contractors.
