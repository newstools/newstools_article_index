&nbsp; Manila:Philippine police used tear gas to disperse about 1,000 anti-U.S. protesters outside the U.S. embassy in Manila on Wednesday, as television news footage showed a patrol van, which had come under attack, driving at demonstrators. The rally came as President Rodrigo Duterte visits Beijing to strengthen relations with the world&#39;s second-largest economy amid deteriorating ties with former colonial power the United States, sparked by his controversial war on illegal drugs. Police made 29 arrests at the rally while at least 10 people were taken to hospital after being hit by the police van, Renato Reyes, secretary general of left-wing activist group Bayan (Nation), told reporters. The protesters were calling for the removal of U.S. troops in the southern island of Mindanao.

He told Obama to &quot;go to hell&quot; and alluded to severing ties with Washington. Then, after weeks of anti-American rhetoric, Duterte said the Philippines would maintain its existing defense treaties and its military alliances. The comments have left Americans and U.S. businesses in the Philippines jittery about their future. &nbsp;
