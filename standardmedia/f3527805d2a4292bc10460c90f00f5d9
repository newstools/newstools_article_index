The county government has procured medical equipment worth Sh3 million to boost healthcare. The equipment includes 50 digital blood pressure machines, nine stethoscopes, 25 manual blood pressure machines, three nebulisers, 16 gun thermometers and 50 digital thermometers. Also 34 beds, 25 mattresses, 10 suction machines, 10 trolleys, 10 couches and 10 screens. The equipment will be distributed to level 4, 3 and 2 hospitals and health centres in Mbeere North and South, Manyatta and Runyenjes sub-counties. Health Executive Pauline Njagi said more funds were allocated to buy more equipment this financial year. She said equipping level 4 and 3 hospitals would decongest the level 5 health facility that serves thousands of patients daily. Most of the level 4 hospitals in the county, including Siakago and Ishiara in Mbeere North, now have theatre services and are able to offer Caesarean section deliveries, which was not the case a year ago. The level 5 hospital offers specialised treatment such as renal dialysis, theatre, CT scans, MRIs, outpatient and inpatient services.
