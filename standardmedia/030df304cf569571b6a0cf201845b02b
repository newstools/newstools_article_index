&nbsp; Paris:Thousands of opponents of gay marriage took to the streets of Paris on Sunday to defend their vision of family values, hoping to revive the issue in political debates ahead of next year&#39;s presidential election. About 24,000 people took part in the demonstration, police said, far fewer than the several hundreds of thousands the group &quot;Demo for All&quot; mobilized in 2012 and 2013 in an unexpectedly strong show of opposition from conservatives, especially Roman Catholics. The Socialist government legalized same-sex marriage, which it called &quot;Marriage for All&quot;, in 2013. Police said 13 people were arrested after a scuffle at the protest, including six topless women from the activist group Femen. Some of them had words &quot;Hate is not a family value&quot; scrawled on their chests.

The protesters marched through prosperous western sections of Paris, waving French flags and the &quot;Demo for All&quot; movement&#39;s blue and pink colors. Some held signs declaring &quot;All together for the family&quot; and &quot;In 2017, I&#39;ll vote for the family.&quot; Organizers estimated the turnout at 200,000. &quot;Even if the gay marriage law has been adopted, we will continue the protest to show that it is not good and we want it to be repealed. We want to influence the political debate that will take place in the coming months,&quot; said one protester. Opinion polls show that a majority in France do not want the gay marriage law to be repealed. Demonstrators also spoke out against surrogate motherhood, which gay couples could use to create a family. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
