A high-level government committee will today begin talks with nine electoral commissioners to determine their send-off package and pave the way for a new team. Yesterday, the Office of the Chief of Staff and Head of Public Service convened a meeting of the committee to prepare for negotiations with the nine Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioners set to leave office. The committee includes representation from the Treasury, Office of the Attorney General, Salaries and Remuneration Commission and the ministries of Interior and Public Service. &quot;The inter-agency committee will lead negotiations with the IEBC commissioners to facilitate the orderly and dignified exit of current commissioners and ensure a seamless transition within the commission,&quot; said a statement by Government Spokesperson Eric Kiraithe. &quot;The committee will also negotiate the commissioners&#39; exit package.&quot; The statement said talks with the commissioners would be undertaken within the confines of the law, adding that the Government notes that the new Election Laws (Amendment) Act only takes effect from October 4. &quot;The Government recognises the urgency that accompanies the ongoing transition process and the need to recruit and bring on board new commissioners as soon as possible,&quot; said the statement.
