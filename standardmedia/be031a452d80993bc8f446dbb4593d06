Twenty local Ford Kenya officials in Bungoma County yesterday decamped to Jubilee Party. The defectors from Sirisia constituency led by former Lwandanyi Councillor Robert Wanyera said they had seen the light. &quot;We have seen nothing in the Opposition. We have suffered long enough. It was time to make a bold move to join Jubilee Party, which has a future for us,&quot; he said. Governor Ken Lusaka, who received them officially in Webuye, asked the group to remain steadfast in their new party because it had their future in mind. Mr Lusaka said only the Jubilee government was able to handle people&#39;s issues effectively. &quot;Let us be in the government where the late Wamalwa Kijana left us. You can&#39;t succeed in opposition,&quot; he said.
