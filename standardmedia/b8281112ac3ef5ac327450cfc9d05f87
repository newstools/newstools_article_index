JERUSALEM:&nbsp;An Arab assailant shot and wounded several people in Jerusalem on Sunday and was then killed by Israeli police, a police spokeswoman said. At least two of the wounded - a police officer and a female pedestrian - were in critical condition. Army Radio said about eight people were hurt. The incident, near Israeli national police headquarters, began when shots were fired from a car at people waiting at a tram stop, the spokeswoman said. The assailant then drove off, chased by motorcycle police, and shot and wounded a woman motorist. &quot;When the terrorist spotted the police he fired at them, and they managed to shoot and kill him,&quot; the police spokeswoman said. One of the police officers was shot by the gunman during the exchange, she said. In the past year, at least 220 Palestinians have died in violent incidents in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Of those, 149 were identified by authorities as assailants while others were killed during clashes and protests. Palestinians, many acting alone and with rudimentary weapons, have killed at least 33 Israelis and two visiting Americans in the attacks.
