Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrived in Nairobi on Thursday in a visit that caught many in Nairobi&#39;s tech and business communities by surprise. On Tuesday, Facebook&#39;s communications team in South Africa sent emails informing journalists that Ime Archibong, Facebook&#39;s director of global product partnerships, would be in town for a brief visit. However, up until early evening on Wednesday, the details of the visit were scanty and images of Mark Zuckerberg in Lagos on his first ever African tour prompted mild self-deprecation comments among Kenya&#39;s Twitter community. &quot;Kenya is losing its place as an ICT hub and the Nigerians are taking over,&quot; tweeted one user. &quot;Very sad for Kenya there was a time we were the first stop,&quot; tweeted another. &quot;This is a lesson that we need to get our house in order,&quot; stated yet another. It was thus a pleasant surprise when images of Mark Zuckerberg eating fish at Mama Oliech&#39;s Restaurant in Nairobi&#39;s Hurlingham surfaced on social media on Thursday afternoon and immediately went viral. Mr Zuckerberg arrived in the country at 11:25pm on Wednesday aboard his private jet. Three helicopters then ferried him and his party of 15 to Wilson Airport from where he headed for an undisclosed hotel to spend the rest of the night. Zuckerberg is worth more than $54 billion (Sh5.4 trillion) and is listed by Forbes as the sixth richest and 19th most powerful man in the world. NINE MINUTES Only five journalists were present at the BRCK&#39;s iHub offices on Ngong Road for an interview that was supposed to be with Archibong but that was hijacked by his boss in a surprise question-and-answer session that took exactly nine minutes. Dressed in a grey T-shirt and blue jeans that have become his trademark look, Zuckerberg was cordial and visibly exhausted but insisted on fielding questions even as his communication team politely pointed to the schedule. &quot;This is a busy 24 hours coming after another busy 24 hours and the developer and entrepreneur community is very vibrant, and you see this almost from the time you step out of the plane,&quot; he explained. &quot;The reason I specifically wanted to come to Nairobi is the fact that Kenya is a clear leader in mobile money,&quot; he said.
