The doctors regulator has come under attack for inaction on its errant members. The concern came up during the health summit held at State House, Nairobi yesterday. In almost 20 years, only one doctor has had his licence revoked by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board (KMPDB). This is against some 900 cases that have come before the board. The latest case being that of 42-year-old Bernard Odhiambo who allegedly spent nearly an hour at the Mbagathi Hospital without being examined by the doctors on duty. Mr Odhiambo who was suffering from complications of tuberculosis and pneumonia died after about 53 minutes after arriving at Mbagathi Hospital on August 14. Odhiambo&#39;s case was brought to the limelight by his cousin, Evans Ayodo, who posted on social media his disappointment on the health system.

Mr Yumbya defended the board, saying of the reported 900 cases, 869 had been determined. About 38 practitioners have been had their licences suspended. &quot;Only 57 of the cases are related to doctors&#39; poor attitude. But this is not something out of the blue. That is why in some of the cases we recommend a practitioner to undergo re-training for at least 12 months,&quot; said Yumbya. However, the shortage of doctors is one of the reasons the board finds it hard to severely punish them.
