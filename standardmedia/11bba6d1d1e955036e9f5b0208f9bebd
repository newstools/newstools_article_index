A woman is nursing serious wounds after her husband allegedly stabbed her seven times on Monday in Kuria West sub-county. Christine Mbusiro said she was attacked by Adrian Musotiro, her spouse of 12 years, barely an hour after they left the chief&#39;s camp where they had been taken to resolve a marital conflict. The mother of three is admitted at Akidiva Mabera Hospital in Kuria West sub-county. Ms Mbusiro told The Standard she had separated from her husband for a while and had rented a house in Nyabohanze. She said her husband, accompanied by Administration Police officers from Mabera, came to her house on Friday morning and took her to the camp. Her father was also summoned. Tagare location chief Jones Buhune said the three came to his office but he told them to come back on Monday after failing to find a solution.

The victim said a few minutes after leaving the chief&#39;s office, Mr Musotiro, who was armed with a knife, waylaid her and stabbed her several times before her screams attracted residents, and the suspect fled. The chief said the man was later brought to his camp by his own father. &quot;I then called one Inspector Kanyi who has an office in the same compound and handed the suspect over to him,&quot; said Mr Buhune. He, however, said the AP claimed the suspect who had a small cut on his hand needed to receive treatment first. &quot;I told him to book in the suspect first because the injury was just a small cut but he insisted and gave him to two officers to take him to hospital,&quot; added Buhune.
