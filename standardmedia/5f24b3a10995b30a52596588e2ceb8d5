The county will use Sh6 million to install surveillance cameras in Kitui and Mwingi Level Four hospitals. Health Chief Officer Fredrick Muli said the project was meant to enhance security in the two facilities. He also condemned an incident on Monday when a group of activists forced their way into the county referral hospital and reportedly roughed up a guard to protest reports that doctors had neglected an accident victim.
