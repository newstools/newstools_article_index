As reverberations of Nyeri County Assembly&rsquo;s unsuccessful attempt to impeach Governor Nderitu &nbsp; Gachagua&nbsp;continue to be felt in the region, there is every indication the county boss&rsquo; rivalry with former Mathira MP Ephraim&nbsp;Maina&nbsp;will continue to play out. Gachagua&nbsp;minced no words in linking&nbsp;Maina&nbsp;with the plot to have him impeached when he appeared before the Senate to defend himself against accusations leveled against him by Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) during the impeachment proceedings in the House. The governor&rsquo;s claims that a wealthy politician was behind the scheme to remove him from office have now drawn out Mr&nbsp;Maina, who came out in the open yesterday to criticise the Senate for clearing&nbsp;Gachagua&nbsp;&ldquo;when they had watertight evidence.&rdquo; And even as&nbsp;Maina&nbsp;denied&nbsp;Gachagua&rsquo;s&nbsp;accusations, he had few kind words for the Senate. Wrong-doing &ldquo;What happened in the plenary was a mockery of justice. I can tell you 95 per cent of Nyeri people were not happy with the senate resolutions to clear the governor,&rdquo;&nbsp;Maina&nbsp;said, and noted that there was overwhelmingly evidence that linked&nbsp;Gachagua&nbsp;to wrong-doing.

The governor claimed that&nbsp;Maina&nbsp;hosted meetings between April and July to plan how to frustrate and get him impeached. Gachagua&nbsp;told the Senate that&nbsp;Maina&nbsp;held four meetings with MCAs at his home and at Greenhills hotel in Nyeri. &ldquo;The meetings to plot for my removal were held under the chairmanship of&nbsp;Maina. The first one was to plan how I would be left out of the leadership of the Jubilee merger and to discredit my performance as governor,&rdquo;&nbsp;Gachagua&nbsp;told an attentive House. But&nbsp;Maina&nbsp;has dismissed the claims as baseless. &ldquo;Those allegations are false and I unreservedly deny them. I have not been to Greenhills Hotel in Nyeri for more than three years. Nor have I entertained MCAs at my rural home for the purposes alleged by the governor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These (the MCAs) are grown up and responsible men and women who make their own independent decisions. It is demeaning for anyone to suggest that they may have been influenced by an individual.&rdquo; GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 Next &raquo;
