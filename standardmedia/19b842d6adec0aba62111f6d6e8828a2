NAIROBI: Police are holding five suspects for conning a businessman out of 200 mobile phones valued at Sh30 million. The phones were to be supplied to delegates during the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (Ticad VI) summit, held last month in Nairobi. The suspects forged documents and conned the businessman, based in Hurlingham, to release the iPhone 6 handsets and ipads days before the summit. Police were allowed by the court to hold the five until Wednesday in order to complete investigations. According to police investigations, the suspects used a fake Local Purchase Order with a logo showing it originated from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
