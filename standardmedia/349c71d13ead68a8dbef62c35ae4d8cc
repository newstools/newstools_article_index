&nbsp; A court in Kisumu has reinstated the principal of Ahero Girls High School, whose interdiction sparked riots. The Employment and Labour Relations Court allowed Sister Sarah Adipo to resume duty, a fortnight after she was interdicted by the Teachers Service Commission over alleged mismanagement and embezzlement of funds. The order offers the principal temporary relief until a case against her is heard and determined. Lady Justice Maureen Onyango issued a temporary injunction suspending TSC&#39;s letter of interdiction sent to the principal on October 6. Ms Adipo&#39;s interdiction sparked protests by the students leading to the closure of the school. Nyando MP Fred Outa was arrested and charged with inciting the students to riot. Outa was released on a Sh100,000 cash bail. Mr Innocent Masara, a member of the school&#39;s board, criticised its closure without their involvement.
