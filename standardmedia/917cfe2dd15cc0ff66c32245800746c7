Nine tea farmers, who were arrested and remanded for protesting poor bonus payment, were released after local politicians intervened. Their release came a week after they were charged at a Nyamira court for allegedly taking part in a riot and failing to raise Sh1 million fine. &nbsp;Led by Kitutu Masaba parliamentary aspirant and Kennedy Kaburi and Nyamira senatorial seat contender, Nyambega Mose, a lawyer, raised Sh270,000 cash bail for all the nine. Mose has also pledged to represent them in court. -Stanley Ongwae
