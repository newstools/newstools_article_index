A woman who sold toxic brew that killed eight people has been sentenced to death. Lady Justice Jessie Lessit found Jennifer Wanjiru Ng&#39;ang&#39;a guilty of killing five of the eight people who died after consuming the brew in Ruiru five years ago. Justice Lessit&#39;s landmark ruling is likely to send shockwaves among illicit brewers and sellers in the country. Ms Wanjiru will face death as a result of what she considered a normal business day in Gitambaya village of Ruiru in Kiambu County on September 11, 2011. On that day, Jane Wambua Kamau, David Karanja Nduati, Samuel Waweru Wanjiku, James Mwita Wanjiku, Julius Kariuki Mwangi, Joseph Ndichu Kamau and Stephen Nzuki went to Ms Wanjiku&#39;s &#39;Kings Pub&#39;, little knowing that the alcohol had been laced with methanol.

They were rushed to hospital, where eight of them died. Wanjiku was initially charged with selling illicit brew. But when postmortem results revealed that the brew had been laced with methanol, she was charged with murder. Some of the witnesses testified that they were with the people who died on that day. Others testified that they had seen their friends going to the pub, which was popular because the drinks were cheap. In her defence, Wanjiru denied owning any bar in Ruiru or selling alcohol. She also argued that she did know any of the people who died and that she had never met any of the witnesses who testified in court. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
