Congolese police and anti-government protesters Monday clashed in the capital Kinshasa, killing at least eight people including three policemen. This was during a march against President Joseph Kabila&rsquo;s perceived bid to extend his mandate. Police spokesman Colonel Pierre Mwanamputu put the toll at eight dead, including three police officers. At least two of them were burned, he said, and five civilians also died. The protest attended by thousands came amid growing local and international pressure on Kabila to step down when his mandate legally ends in December. The opposition accuse him of plotting to extend his tenure by delaying elections that were meant to happen in November until at least next year. His supporters deny the charge.
