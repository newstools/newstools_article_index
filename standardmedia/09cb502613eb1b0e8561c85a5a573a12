Kisii Senator Chris Obure has said he is willing to work with the Jubilee government after consulting widely with the people. Mr Obure and proponents of the Kisii Unity group Sunday held their last consultative rally where the senator indicated that the community had to take a new direction politically. Addressing residents at Nyaribari Chache in the presence of Deputy President William Ruto, who was presiding over a funds drive in aid of Nyansira Secondary School on Friday, Obure said his decision was pegged on the community&#39;s resolve to support the national government. &quot;We must decide either to remain in the opposition or join the Government and achieve our development goals,&quot; he said. Obure&#39;s statement comes at a time when the ODM party is threatening to expel some of its members who have announced plans to defect to other parties. &quot;It is a new dawn for the Kisii community. I have led the community in supporting the opposition in the last two consecutive elections but we have not achieved much. We must find an alternative,&quot; said Obure.
