A school has launched a campaign to lobby for a curriculum for students suffering from cerebral palsy. Dr Ribeiro Parklands Primary School held a seven-kilometre walk to raise awareness of the condition. They called on the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development to develop a curriculum for children affected. The school is the only public institution with a fully fledged cerebral palsy unit. It has 104 pupils. &quot;Of the pupils, 46 of them are integrated in regular schools,&quot; said the school&#39;s head teacher, Rose Mureu. The walk was flagged off at 11am by Josephta Mukobe, Principal Secretary for the State Department of Coordination.
