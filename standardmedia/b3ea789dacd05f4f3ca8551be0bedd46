The cacophony that has followed Opposition leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s claim the Government is building water tunnels that have the capacity to impact negatively on the environment has left citizens confused. Anything that affects the environment deserves careful attention to detail. As we have seen, the devastation that the destruction of the Mau forest has done to the environment is only just beginning to show. The Government has not denied the existence of the Northern Collector Tunnels project expected to cost Sh6.8 billion. What is troubling is the direction the debate is taking. It is not important to know who started the project. What is of primary concern is establishing how this project will impact on the environment. Mr Odinga has claimed the channelling of the water from rivers within Murang&#39;a County to Nairobi will lead to desertification in some areas. Such concerns cannot just be swept under the carpet because of competing political interest. Sobriety must prevail to allow for honest discussions. We must move away from politicising this issue and address the concerns that have been raised. The Environmental Impact Assessment report should be made available to experts and the public for perusal.
