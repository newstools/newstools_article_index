It is 8pm at Nairobi&rsquo;s Luthuli Avenue matatu stage on a Saturday evening. A 14-seater matatu is about to leave for Eastlands. The driver, dressed in a faded brown T-shirt, jumps behind the wheel, chewing miraa. A strong stench of alcohol fills the tiny, poorly ventilated vehicle but the passengers pretend not to care. They only throw sideways glances at each other but no one speaks. Even in the darkness, the driver&rsquo;s blood-shot eyes are clearly visible. &ldquo;Mwema, hiyo round next ni yangu (Mwema, the next round is mine),&rdquo; shouts his colleague as he hands him a bottle of soft drink which, in all probability, is not a soft drink.

Mwema is a &lsquo;squad driver&rsquo;, and so is his colleague. Yes, he is licensed as a public service driver but he does not have a designated vehicle. Every day he risks the lives of hundreds of Kenyans, who are unaware of his incompetence, in his search for Sh200 or Sh300, if he is lucky. He wakes up daily and hangs around the stage at City Centre with crossed fingers, hoping that someone will shout his name, informing him that the main driver of a particular matatu has not shown up for some undisclosed reason. And that way, a 35-seater will make Sh100 more. Of course with his speed and his incompetence, he is prone to accidents. But as usual, he will be the only one who survives with all four limbs intact before he vanishes into&nbsp; thin air probably to resurface in another bus park to perform similar antics.
