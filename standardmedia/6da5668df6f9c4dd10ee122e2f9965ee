An Eldoret court has ordered former Eldoret South MP Peris Simam and her husband Enock Kimeli Somam to pay Sh10.6 million fine or serve 18 years in prison over an economic crime. The couple, charged alongside four others, were found guilty of a conspiracy to commit an offence of an economic crime. The others are Shachile Mikoya Laban, Maluti Pamela Maluti, John Simiyu Khaemba, Wisdom Kimutai Maina. The offence was committed between January 6, 2010 and April 1, 2010 in Eldoret town, Uasin Gishu County. Peris, who was by then serving as an MP, faced a charge of 10 counts of conspiracy to commit an offence of an economic crime. The crime involved influencing the award of a contract for the routine maintenance and spot improvement of the Bayete-Chuiyat-Bargeiywa Road in Eldoret South constituency to Kachur Holdings Ltd.

Yesterday, the MP who was accompanied by some supporters and family members who thronged the packed court in Eldoret listened to the ruling alongside her co-accused persons pensively. Chief Magistrate Wanjiru Cherere while delivering the ruling said: &ldquo;Time has come for Kenyans to know that embezzlement of public funds and economic crimes and corruption does not pay.&rdquo; The four co-accused persons were also slapped with various fines. The accused have a right to lodge an appeal.
