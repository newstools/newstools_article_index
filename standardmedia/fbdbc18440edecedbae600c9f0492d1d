Opposition chief Raila Odinga has dismissed reports linking him to the questionable winding up of a profitable arm of the national carrier Kenya Airways (KQ). Speaking from Kampala, Uganda, the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) leader yesterday dismissed the reports linking a company associated with him and his family to the KQ cargo saga, terming them as &quot;utter nonsense&quot;. &quot;The reports are malicious and lack fact,&quot; said Raila, who added that he will issue a comprehensive response to the claims today, when he jets back to the country. The airline&#39;s cargo handling and processing unit, one of the most profitable arms of the company, was shut down in 2004 and the cargo handling business outsourced to a competitor, in what may have contributed to its near financial ruin. After the shutting down of the unit Kencargo International Limited, in cost cutting measure by the national carrier, Astral Aviation Limited (AAL) landed the lucrative deal.
