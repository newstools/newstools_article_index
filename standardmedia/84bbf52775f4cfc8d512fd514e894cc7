Rice co-operative societies have received 20 tractors and 16 combine harvesters at a subsidised price of Sh60 million. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett said the highly subsidised farm machinery would increase efficiency and augment Mwea Irrigation Scheme, which is being expanded through the construction of Thiba Dam. The new dam, funded through a partnership with the Japanese government, is expected to expand the area under irrigated rice from 20,000 to 30,000 acres. &quot;The Government is also introducing other technologies and best practices that inculcate a water-saving culture in rice production,&quot; he said. He said last year, the Government allocated 117,400 bags of various types of subsidised fertiliser to smallholder farmers in the county to increase crop yields. In a speech read on his behalf by Johnson Irungu, a director at Kilimo House, during the launch of the national farmers&#39; award scheme demonstration farm in Mukinduri, Bett said the Government would set up more demonstration farms to serve as centres for learning modern farming methods.

In the past three years, about 100 farmers have been identified as winners in various categories for the award scheme.
