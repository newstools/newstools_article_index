Kieni Member of Parliament Kanini Kega has downplayed the impending impeachment of Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua. He is now calling for dialogue between the two opposing camps to end the budget stalemate. The MP also told the governor to stop pretending everything was running smoothly when his government was operating on half of its last year budget. &quot;Impeachment should be the last option keeping in minds it&#39;s only one year to elections. Lets work together,&quot; Mr Kega said. He was speaking at Nairutia in his constituency yesterday. He also advised members of the county assembly to set their political differences aside.
