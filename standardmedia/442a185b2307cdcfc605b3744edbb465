Dear Director Pensions Department, We know your name to be Shem Nyakutu. Many Kenyans do not know you. In fact, you may pass unnoticed along the streets. Perhaps that is a good thing because if they recognised you, they would tell you this in your face. Since you are the most important person at Bima House, we have a message for you. We have been watching our emails clog with complaint after complaint from frustrated Kenyans. Our desk is littered with letters from the civil service, teachers and even retired members of the disciplined forces. Civil servants who retire expecting to meet their financial obligations through their pension face a painful process to get the money. The lucky ones either have to bribe someone or endure the numerous trips to Bima House. The speed will depend on how deep their pockets are. We will need a full day to be able to list the number of cases we have for your office. These are distinguished Kenyans who have served their country. Some were nurses, taking care of the sick in our hospitals. Some were your teachers. Some were in the military, where their job was to make sure you are safe. There were office cleaners, secretaries and personal assistants who made sure that you and other government officials have their offices ready, their diaries well-kept and flasks of tea full. Why should a man who has served his country for 30 years be taken round in circles and made to suffer at old age? Listen, we have visited Bima House to see for ourselves first-hand what really goes on in the corridors of your offices. As a paper that champions the interests of the downtrodden, we were shocked, to say the least. Hear this; your office will take the trophy, any day, for being the most unreceptive government office in Kenya. Is it that you are under resourced? Is it that you have the worst civil servants working under you? Or is it that people are just incompetent and indifferent to the plight of retirees? GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
