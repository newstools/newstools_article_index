Some Wiper MCAs have warned of a mass exodus should party leader Kalonzo Musyoka not give clear direction on nominations. Speaking at a press conference in Kitui town yesterday, 26 MCAs allied to governor Julius Malombe claimed that for the past six months, the party had been thrown into upheaval through alleged divisive pronouncements by Kitui Senator David Musila. Mr Musila, who is also the party chairman, has declared he will challenge Malombe for the governor&#39;s seat in next year&#39;s General Election. Led by County Assembly Majority Leader Jacob Maundu, the MCAs urged Mr Kalonzo to ensure free and fair nominations. The ward reps who included Bernard Sila (Mwingi Central), Peter Kilonzo (Athi), Jackson Mwanduka (Mutomo), Nzyoni Manguye (Voo Kyamatu) Angeline Mbula (Kyuso) and deputy speaker Titus Mbiti advised Kalonzo to put his house in order before its too late. The MCAs took issue with Musila&#39;s recent utterances at a rally in Kabati in which the senator and four MPs; Francis Nyenze (Kitui West), Mutua Muluvi (Kitui East), Bernard Kitungi (Mwingi West) and Charles Nyamai (Kitui Rural) claimed the party had &quot;its owners&quot; and advised Malombe to decamp.
