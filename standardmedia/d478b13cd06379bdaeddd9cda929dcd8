FORD&nbsp;Kenya party leader Moses&nbsp;Wetang&rsquo;ula&nbsp;has accused the&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;government of plotting to kill multi-party democracy. He&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;that the merger of&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;affiliate parties to form&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;Party was a scheme to re-introduce a one party state which made majority of Kenyans suffer. Speaking yesterday at Kimalewa village, Kabuchai constituency in Bungoma County during the burial of Gabriel Khisa, MrWetang&rsquo;ula&nbsp;assured that CORD affiliate parties will not dissolve but will move together as a coalition. &ldquo;FORD&nbsp;fought for multi-party democracy but&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;leaders want to kill what has helped many Kenyans, folding of all the 12 parties to join&nbsp;Jubilee&nbsp;Party that was launched yesterday is a sure way of destroying democracy but we in CORD won&rsquo;t fold our affiliate parties,&rdquo; he said. The Bungoma Senator who is also CORD co-principal noted that Masinde Muliro and Kijana Wamalwa painstakingly fought for multi-partyism and Kenyans should protect the democratic gains achieved by their forefathers. He affirmed that Ford Kenya, ODM and Wiper will remain together and they will use a democratic process to nominate the CORD presidential candidate.
