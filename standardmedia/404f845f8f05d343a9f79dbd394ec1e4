Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery has warned hate mongers that they will be punished severely, including being barred from contesting political seats. Nkaissery said his ministry was planning to press for a motion in Parliament that will enable relevant authorities to bar politicians who incite their people against others. &ldquo;We will not sit back and watch as leaders incite the public. Anyone doing so will face the full force of the law,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As we approach the General Elections we know some leaders will take advantage and preach hatred to seek political mileage. We are watching them very closely.&rdquo; &mdash;Peterson Githaiga
