The battle for Murang&rsquo;a County gubernatorial went a notch higher as Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau said he is determined to send home Governor Mwangi wa Iria. Mr Kamau was celebrating his 10th anniversary as an MP at an event Governor Iria had threatened to gatecrash yesterday. But Mr Iria kept off the Kigumo Bendera venue. On Friday, Iria threatened to raid the event with his supporters if Kamau attacked his development record. There was a heavy police presence, both in civilian clothing and in uniform, with several donning anti-riot gear. The security was backed by aides attached to various MPs who graced the event. Kamau was accompanied by his wife, Agnes Irungu and five MPs; Alice Wahome (Kandara), Muthomi Njuki (Chuka Igambang&rsquo;ombe), Maison Leshomo (Samburu County), Mohammed Elmi and Mpuri Aburi (Tigania East). Of the seven constituencies in Murang&rsquo;a, only Wahome attended, while Kamau delivered apologies from a few MPs supporting him, including Sabina Chege (Murang&rsquo;a County MP). Nine MCAs from the county also attended the daylong event capped by a luncheon at the venue. During the event that started shortly after midday, Kamau who has been vocal in criticising Iria&rsquo;s legacy took time to spell out misplaced opportunities in Murang&rsquo;a County Government&rsquo;s allocation of funds. The two-time Kigumo MP said his dream of becoming Murang&rsquo;a governor was irreversible, as he called on residents to support his bid. In his two terms in Parliament, he said he has been instrumental in improving education standards and tarmacking of major roads in the constituency. &ldquo;In the last three years, Kigumo has been leading in education performance, while it used to be the last,&rdquo; said Kamau.
