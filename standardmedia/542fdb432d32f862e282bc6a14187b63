A group of elders from Keiyo and Nandi communities want Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago to apologise for leading a protest against the appointment of Professor Laban Ayiro as the acting Vice Chancellor of Moi University. The elders said the saga had portrayed the region negatively and eroded gains enjoyed since 2007/2008. The elders from the region led by Charles Cheborit took issue with Mandago and other leaders over their conduct when they stormed the institution to demand for the appointment of Professor Isaac Kosgei as Vice Chancellor. &quot;Our Governor should apologise and lead by example. We are concerned over his prejudicial politics,&quot; said Cheborit. Patrick Kibet, another elder said, &quot;It should be clear that Moi University and other institutions of higher learning are financed through tax payer&#39;s money and in case of administrative issues, proper channels should be followed.&quot; Similar sentiments were echoed by Uasin Gishu Senator Isaac Melly who told off the politicians whom he said are using Moi University row for political gains.
