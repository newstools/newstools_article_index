An education official in Narok has accused some head teachers of protecting people who impregnated schoolgirls. Narok North Sub-County Education Officer Kuyo Saoina said the perpetrators were being shielded on the basis of coming from the same clan or age-set. He said these cultural considerations had made it difficult for the police and local education office to act on the culprits, among whom are teachers. Speaking during a meeting with head teachers from the sub-county at St Mary&#39;s Primary School in Narok, Mr Saoina warned the school heads against adopting retrogressive cultures, saying those found culpable would face the law. &quot;It has come to our attention that some head teachers are protecting teachers who come from their clans and age-sets and who are suspected of impregnating schoolgirls. This is making it hard to prosecute them,&quot; said the education officer. He called for universal access to education for all children regardless of gender, adding that teachers should be at the forefront of protecting the rights of the girl-child.

The Ministry of Education has introduced a re-entry programme to enable girls to return to school after giving birth. Parents should not marry their daughters off just because they have given birth,&quot; said Saoina.
