The National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) has stopped the construction of a multi-million shopping complex in Kisumu. Canouh Berry Enterprises Ltd had applied for approval to build the complex near Nakumatt Mega City along Nairobi-Kisumu highway. But Nema rejected the application saying the complex would destroy the environment. The authority advised the investors to look for an alternative project.
