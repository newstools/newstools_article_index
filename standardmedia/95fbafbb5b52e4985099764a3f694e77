Therefore, there will be massive publications and dissemination of party policies bearing the slogan thus increasing the threat of further breach of my trademark,&quot; said Katiku. He said he feared that those who secured nominations would also popularise themselves using the slogan thereby breaching his trademark further. On September 10, Katiku noted the party prepared huge banners and billboards bearing his slogan and placed them in strategic locations within Nairobi in readiness for the party&#39;s launch. &quot;This was in addition to massive daily newspaper adverts with the &#39;Tuko Pamoja&#39; slogan&nbsp;all aimed at popularising the launch,&quot; he said.
