Deputy President William Ruto yesterday demanded a retraction and apology from activist Boniface Mwangi over a libellous tweet. In a letter through Kilukumi and Company Advocates, the DP Ruto wants Mwangi&rsquo;s apology to reach him within seven days starting yesterday. Mwangi is said to have wrote the libellous tweet (which we won&rsquo;t repeat here due to legal purposes), on 28 September, 2016 through a social media platform (twitter) using his personal Twitter handle. &ldquo;Our instructions are that this tweet is false and malicious. The words in their ordinary and plain meaning are defamatory and they have severely injured our client&rsquo;s reputation,&rdquo; said senior counsel Kioko Kilukumi. He wrote, &ldquo;The defamatory words attracted 556 retweets and 476 likes as of today at 9:30 am 21 hours and 42 minutes after the tweet was posted as well as numerous comments from different people who now view our client as a murderer and a thief. DP Ruto warned that should Mwangi fail to offer an apology, he will be moving to court to seek redress.
