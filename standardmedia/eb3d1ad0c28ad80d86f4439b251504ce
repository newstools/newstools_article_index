Mandera Governor Ali Roba has rallied the public to reject a declaration by local elders barring him from defending his seat. The Garre Council of Elders announced that all current elected elders from the county should be locked out of next year&#39;s polls, drawing criticism from the governor. In a three-day tour of 32 trading centres in the county, Mr Roba stated his reasons against the decision. The governor went to the grassroots to collect views in relation to the Banisa declaration, which seeks to dim the political future of incumbent northern Kenya leaders. Roba engaged in politics during inspection of over 50 new health facilities as preparations to launch them takes final steps. &quot;It is paramount that the council of elders engages the public in any popular decision they want to make other than sitting down as a group of a few people and then making statements that go against the aspirations of the people they represent,&quot; Roba said.
