Chief Justice nominee, David Maraga&nbsp;has been involved in a number of court rulings that struck many for their &#39;Solomonic&#39; wisdom. From ruling that treasury pay retired teachers to saving an 81-year-old man from the hangman&#39;s noose.. In 2008,Justice Maraga set pace for retired teachers to demand Sh42.3 billion in pension arrears from their former employer, Teachers Service Commission. The former teachers sued the commission in 2006, claiming unpaid lump-sum salary increments and accrued pension from July 1997, insisting that a 1997 salary increment covered them too. Judge Maraga ruled in favour of the teachers in October 23, 2008. He ruled that all retired teachers covered by the 1997 pay agreement were entitled to revised retirement benefits. Justice Maraga was in a bench of three judges who revoked a single digital license that had been issued by Government to Pan-African Network Group and national broadcaster KBC&#39;s subsidiary, Signet.
