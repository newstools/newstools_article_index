&nbsp; Mogadishu: Somali security forces shut down a newspaper and arrested an editor, the Somali journalists&#39; union said on Sunday, the latest crackdown in what reporters say is a climate of intimidation.&nbsp; Intelligence officers stormed the offices of Xog Ogaal, confiscating computers and cameras, and detained an editor, Abdi Adan Guled, on Saturday night, the National Union of Somali Journalists said. It was unclear why Guled was arrested, but the union said it was the first time the government had acted against the paper, which has been publishing since 1991. Somali authorities did not return calls seeking comment. Security forces and officials frequently detain or threaten journalists whose coverage has offended them. Many media houses are concerned that intimidation will increase when twice-delayed presidential elections are finally held. They are currently scheduled for Nov. 30.
