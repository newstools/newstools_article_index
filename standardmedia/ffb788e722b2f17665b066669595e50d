Hundreds of squatters are up in arms against alleged harassment by&nbsp; Kenya Ordinance Factory (KOFC) soldiers. The squatters at Maili Tisa in Eldoret have been living on a 30-acre piece of land that is claimed by the KOFC, owned by the Department of Defence (DoD). According to the squatters, trouble started in April, when they planted maize on the piece of land. Soldiers from the KOFC uprooted the entire crop and planted theirs, sparking protests. Now the squatters claim the soldiers are arbitrarily arresting them for trespassing and illegal grazing and destroying their houses. &quot;As we speak now, we do not have food since the maize we planted was uprooted by the officers. The military personnel come into our homes and if they find even a maize cob, we are arrested for harvesting their maize,&quot; said Rosaline Tanui. She said the soldiers have been harassing them since the Government compulsorily acquired the land in the 1970s to set up the bullet factory. The villagers claimed the soldiers stripped and beat up some women for illegal grazing.

We have suffered enough and the Government should settle this matter to ensure we live normal lives,&quot; said Sammy Kosgei. Kosgei said attempts to resolve the issue with the KOFC management had proved futile as factory administration keeps ignoring calls for dialogue. Turbo deputy county commissioner John Kinjo appealed to the soldiers to avoid direct contact with the squatters but refer any disharmony to the police. Area MP Elisha Busienei called for dialogue and a buffer zone to separate the squatters&#39; area from the bullet factory. &quot;We shall soon hold a meeting with National Land Commission (NLC), DoD officers and local leaders,&quot; he said.
