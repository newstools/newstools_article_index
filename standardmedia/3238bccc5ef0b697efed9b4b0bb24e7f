VOI: A committee has been appointed to prepare for the commemoration of the historic first flight in East Africa. The committee, to be chaired by Sarova Taita Hills and Salt Lick Lodges General Manager Willy Mwadilo, will be launched by Governor John Mruttu this week. Organisers say the event will be held on October 8, this year at the oldest airstrip in East and Central Africa in Maktau, between Mwatate and Taveta towns. &ldquo;The event is taking place at Maktau where the first flight in East Africa took to the skies in the region. There will be full air show from morning to evening at the commemorative site,&rdquo; Mr Mwadilo said. &ldquo;On October 3 this year it will be 101 years since the first recorded flight in East Africa took to the skies. From last year the county government has celebrated this annual event with the support of Sarova Hotels, Aero Clubs of Kenya, Guerrillas of Tsavo, Lions Bluff, Kenya Civil Aviation Authority and Kenya tourism Board among other partners,&rdquo; Mr Mruttu said. Speaking in Voi town yesterday, Mwadilo who is also the chairperson of the Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers in Tsavo and Amboseli, said the event will not only help improve tourism, but also economically empower the local community. &ldquo;The local community will showcase their cultural heritage besides selling indigenous food to visitors,&rdquo; he said.
