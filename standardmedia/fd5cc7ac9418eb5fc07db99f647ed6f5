Gicharu said MKU is a fast growing university that requires strategic partnerships. &quot;We are only 20 years old, so it is important to learn from a school like Clarke. My work is to provide the leadership and to make sure the resources are there to make it happen,&quot; said Gicharu. Burns said the university is also keen to expose their students to the global world. &quot;We are very interested in our students being globally and inter-culturally engaged, so it gives our students the opportunity to learn more about themselves and others,&quot; Burns said. Donna Anderson, director of international programs at the university said having students from other countries on exchange, results into strategic friendships with Clarke students.
