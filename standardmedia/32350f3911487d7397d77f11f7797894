To provide clean and safe drinking water to the people of Baraberi in Tigania West, and other dry regions Meru County Government has procured a new borehole drilling rig. While commissioning a borehole at Baraberi and the Mweronkanga Hospital in Tigania West, Governor Peter Munya said residents are faced with scarcity of safe and clean drinking water, saying his administration is working hard to address the problem. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hiring rigs to sink boreholes is expensive so we have bought our own rig to enable us dig them everywhere and save residents the trouble of trekking for long distances in search of water,&rdquo; Munya, who was accompanied by Water Executive Mary Mwiti, Road&rsquo;s Executive Newton Itobi and other senior officials, said. The governor said the government will lay a pipeline to distribute water to residents in their homes. - Phares Mutembei
