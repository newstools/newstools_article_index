&nbsp; Tribal clashes have erupted in troubled area of Kosovo in Naivasha leaving one man dead and over ten houses burnt. The man was shot dead using a G3 rifle near Kambi Shetani village that borders Eburu forest. This brought to seven the number of people who have been killed in the area since the year began. There are claims that a group of warriors armed with guns and arrows had been driven from the neighbouring Narok County to the volatile area.

He said that the 50 year-old farmer was shot on the chest and later attacked using crude weapons as he lay on the ground bleeding. &quot;The attackers cut off the farmers head and later went ahead to burn over ten houses before fleeing into the nearby Eburu forest,&quot; he said. Naivasha Assistant County Commissioner John Opondo said that the body of the farmer had since been collected. He admitted that a gun had been used in the murder, terming the trend as worrying and one that needed to be tamed immediately. &quot;One person has been shot dead following fresh clashes in Kosovo area and we have embarked on a major operation to net the gun and those responsible,&quot; he said.
