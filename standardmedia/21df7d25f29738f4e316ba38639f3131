Meru County Government has bought a rig that will be used to drill boreholes in arid and semi-arid areas of the expansive region. In coming months, boreholes will be dug in the dry Igembe, Buuri and Tigania regions where residents have had to trek long distances in search of water. Water, Environment and Natural Resources County Executive Mary Mwiti told residents of Athiru Ruujine that a programme to construct water tanks had also been launched. Each of the 225 water tanks to be constructed will have a capacity to store up to 225,000 litres of water. &ldquo;These tanks have roofs that will allow for the harvesting of&nbsp; rain water. &nbsp; We are introducing rain water harvesting technology in areas that have perennially faced water shortages,&rdquo; Mwiti said.&nbsp; The county government has also constructed pipelines&nbsp; through&nbsp; most dry regions as it works on providing homesteads with clean water.
