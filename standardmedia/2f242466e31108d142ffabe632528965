Initial reports put the number of attackers at three, but Sediqqi said police special forces who responded to the scene found and killed only one gunman. The attacker was dressed in a police uniform, said Jamshid Jan, who witnessed the attack. An angry crowd surrounded and kicked at the suspected attacker&#39;s dead body, with some vowing to burn his remains, before police intervened. Security forces at the scene evacuated the shrine as the attack unfolded, said Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman Rahimi. The attack occurred at one of Kabul&#39;s largest shrines as Shi&#39;ite Muslims gathered to observe the Ashura holy day, which commemorates the 7th Century death of a grandson of the prophet Mohammed.
