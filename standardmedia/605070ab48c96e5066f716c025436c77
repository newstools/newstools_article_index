&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} Bangkok:A royal convoy on Friday carried the body of Thailand&#39;s King Bhumibol past thousands of weeping Thais to his riverside Grand Palace in Bangkok ahead of a funeral and a traditional royal cremation that will need months to prepare. The world&#39;s longest-reigning monarch, who was worshipped as a father figure during his 70-year reign, died in a Bangkok hospital on Thursday after a long illness. He was 88. The convoy, which included heir apparent Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, moved slowly through Bangkok&#39;s ancient quarter past mourners dressed in black, many of them holding aloft portraits of the king. According to tradition, the bodies of Thai royals are placed in a golden urn. But palace officials said the tradition was no longer upheld and the king&#39;s body would be placed in a coffin with a symbolic royal urn near it. Later on Friday at the Grand Palace, Prince Vajiralongkorn will preside as Buddhist monks chant over the remains.

Most people in the capital and in towns across the country dressed in black but shops opened for business. The king stepped in to calm crises on several occasions during his reign and many Thais worry about a future without him. The military, which took power in a 2014 coup, has for decades invoked its duty to defend the monarchy to justify its intervention in politics. Military government leader Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Thursday security was his top priority and he ordered extra troops deployed around the country. GO TO PAGE 1 2 3 4 Next &raquo;
