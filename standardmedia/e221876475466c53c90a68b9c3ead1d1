A man killed his wife by cutting open her stomach with a knife and removing her intestines and other organs, which he used to scare off shocked villagers. But George Arwa was immediately lynched by the villagers of Kasewe in Rachuonyo East Sub-county. Arwa, 44, is said to have locked up his wife Millicent Auma, 30, in the house on Thursday night, hacked off her limbs using an axe then used a knife to open up her stomach. When the villagers stormed his home yesterday morning, Arwa tied the women&#39;s intestines on both of his hands and threatened to kill them the same way he had his wife. &quot;The man may have covered the woman&#39;s mouth with a piece of cloth to deter her from screaming when he attacked her. He also ordered his brother-in-law&#39;s eight-year-old son who lived with them not to make noise lest he be killed on the spot,&quot; said Daniel Okelo, a resident. &quot;After killing his eldest wife, the man went to spend the night in the house of his former wife in the same compound.&quot; Early in the morning, the boy ran to a neighbour&#39;s home and reported what had happened. That is when the villagers attacked Arwa. The assailant then escaped into a nearby bush where the villagers caught up with him and killed him on the spot.
