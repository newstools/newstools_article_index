Washington: The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to reject President Barack Obama&#39;s veto of a bill allowing relatives of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, the first veto override of Obama&#39;s eight-year-long presidency. The vote was 348-76, well above the two-thirds majority needed for an override. The Senate earlier opposed the veto by 97-1, so the &quot;Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act&quot; will become law. The veto override is a blow to Obama, and to Saudi Arabia, one of the longest-standing U.S. allies in the Arab world.
