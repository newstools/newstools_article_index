A retired teacher has managed to stop a woman claiming to be his wife from burying her son on his farm. Benjamin Kibiwot Chesulut moved to court in February 2015 to block the burial of Wilson Kerich on his farm in Ngata, Nakuru County, arguing that he was not his son. Mercy Chelangat, who claimed to have been married to Mr Chesulut in a customary marriage, wanted her son to be interred on Chesulut&#39;s land. Chesulut while testifying before Lands Court judge Silas Munyao he vehemently denied that he had any relationship with Chelangat and said he had no idea how she had settled on his farm. He told the court that he neither built a house for Chelangat nor supported the two in any way. Chelangat claimed that she had six children with Chesulut. Interestingly, she could not remember the year they got married.

The judge dismissed Chelangat&#39;s claims that they were married in a customary marriage. He said Chelangat had failed to prove that Kerich was Chesulut&#39;s son. He ordered her to move out of&nbsp;Chesulut&#39;s land and not to bury the remains of her son on his farm.
