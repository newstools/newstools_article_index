A section of Kikuyu elders have endorsed former Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph ole Lenku for the Kajiado governor&#39;s seat. In a move likely to spark political jitters across the county, Lenku was endorsed by more than 100 Kikuyu Council of Elders members who termed him &quot;the most ideal candidate&quot; for the seat. In a traditional ceremony conducted at Rangers in Kitengela, the elders vowed to support Lenku to ensure he becomes the Jubilee Party flag bearer in next year&#39;s General Election. &nbsp;Lenku underwent some Kikuyu traditional rituals including receiving wise counsel and advice before a special meat eating session was conducted in the presence of elders only. The ritual also entailed vows that he (Lenku) will remain loyal to the Kikuyu community. He was also recognised as a respectable friend of the Kikuyu community and also given the mandate and authority to join elders in high-profile meetings that influence decision making in the community. Lenku was praised for his ability to unite all communities in the cosmopolitan region.

However, we urge you to unite all communities,&quot; said the elders. Some of the elders said they had seen the fruits of Nyumba Kumi initiative, which was implemented when Lenku was the Interior ministry boss. They also condemned those saying he failed during his tenure, terming the claims &quot;cheap politics being propagated by cheap minds&quot;. Receiving the endorsement, Lenku thanked the elders it came as a big suprise. Last month, the former CS was endorsed by Maasai elders of the Seuri age.
