Speaking during a burial Ceremony in Kures village, Baringo County, Prof Tuitoek described withholding of the results as unfortunate and asked Education Cabinet Secretary, Fred Matiangi, the appointing authority to make the results public. &quot;Some of these issues although small are very sensitive. The purpose of an interview is to look for a better person from the rest. Withholding of the results is creating unnecessary tension among stakeholders,&#39;&#39; he said. While describing the recently witnessed confrontations at University of Eldoret and Moi Universities, he urged the CS in charge and the University managements to resolve pending issues and save the vital institution against being converted into supremacy battle grounds. Mogotio MP, Prof Hellen Sambili who is also parliamentary committee member on higher education said she will table the issue before the committee for discussion and deliberation and asked National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) not only to condemn the protest by North Rift leaders over the appointment of the acting vice-chancellor, but resolve thorny issues at the learning institution. &quot;The commission should address real issues and not restrict itself to condemning and ordering for arrest and prosecution of hate mongers. It is time NCIC move to the ground and listen to various conflicting voices and come up with lasting solutions,&#39;&#39; said Prof Sambili. Education Cabinet Secretary appointed Professor Laban Ayiro as the acting vice-chancellor at the University, a move said to have angered the leaders who wanted Professor Isaac Kosgey, whom they said had topped the recruitment interviews, to be appointed as Vice Chancellor of the institution.
