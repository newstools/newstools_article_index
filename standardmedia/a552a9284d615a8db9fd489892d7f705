MOSCOW:&nbsp;The ceasefire established in Syria has been violated 199 times since it came into force five days ago, a Russian defence ministry official was quoted as saying on Saturday. &quot;The United States and so-called moderate (rebel) groups under their control did not implement any of the obligations taken under the Geneva agreements,&quot; Russian news agencies quoted Lieutenant-General Viktor Poznikhir as saying. &quot;If the United States does not take steps needed to fulfil its obligations under the Sept. 9 agreement, then all the responsibility for any collapse of the ceasefire in Syria would lie with the United States,&quot; he added.
