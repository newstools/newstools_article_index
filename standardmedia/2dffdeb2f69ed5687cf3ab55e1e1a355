CORD co-principal Moses Wetang&#39;ula has said the Opposition is not in a hurry to name its presidential flag bearer. Mr Wetang&#39;ula said in the run-up to the 2002 general election, CORD leader Raila Odinga endorsed retired President Mwai Kibaki as Narc&#39;s joint presidential candidate two months to the elections. Kibaki later faced off with Kanu&#39;s Uhuru Kenyatta. &quot;You all saw what happened as Kibaki was elected Kenya&#39;s third President with an overwhelming majority,&quot; Wetang&#39;ula told worshippers during a church service at the AIC Kongowea Church in Mombasa yesterday. There have been intensified calls for CORD to name its flag bearer, with the Wiper party giving a December 2016 ultimatum. Wiper has demanded the naming of the coalition&#39;s presidential candidate by Christmas Day while the Orange party favours April or May next year.

The Bungoma senator was accompanied by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa, Nyali&#39;s Hezron Awiti, who is eyeing the Mombasa governor&#39;s seat, and Ford-Kenya politician Yasin Bajaber. &quot;I am keen on becoming your president. Kenya is never a dynasty where the top seat can be passed from one generation to the next,&quot; said the Ford-Kenya leader. He scoffed at the Jubilee administration for allegedly perpetuating corruption and called on Kenyans to vote the ruling party out in 2017. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
