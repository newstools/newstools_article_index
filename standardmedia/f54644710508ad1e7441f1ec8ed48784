On the Christmas eve of 2014, Joseph Tobiko returned from a local pub where he had been drinking, stabbed his wife,&nbsp;Mutoka Ole Sai, in the chest and fled. The mother of two died in hospital two days later. Tobiko was later arrested and charged with murder. But on May 16 this year, he struck a plea bargain with the prosecution in which he agreed to plead guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter. The High Court on June 2, this year, jailed him for seven years after he admitted killing his wife without provocation. The plea bargain deal spared him from the hangman&#39;s noose.

The court rejected his plea. &quot;I have considered the circumstances surrounding the case and the mitigation tendered by the counsel for the accused. I note that the accused stabbed the deceased out of the blue and without any provocation whatsoever,&quot; Judge Wilfrida Okwany ruled. &quot;I still believe that this is a case where non-custodial sentence would not be appropriate so that the accused, together with others who are in the habit of attacking others without provocation, can learn that such actions attract the heavy wrath of the law,&quot; he said.
