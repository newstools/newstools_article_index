Bungoma MCAs have dismissed the interim Jubilee Party (JP) national officials announced on Thursday by Committee Chairman Noah Wekesa. They claim the list of interim national officials does not represent the face of Kenya. Speaking at the Westgate Hotel in Bungoma town yesterday, the MCAs, led by Bungoma County JP Chairman Henry Nyongesa, are now calling on President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto to pick the party national officials that represent the face of Kenya. &ldquo;In our agreement before the dissolution, we had agreed that the position of the national Chairman or the Secretary General be taken by Governor Ken Lusaka of NFK, we don&rsquo;t need anything else, let us stick to the agreement,&rdquo; said Nyongesa. He added: &ldquo;Let President Uhuru add his deputy change the directive earlier issued&rdquo;.
