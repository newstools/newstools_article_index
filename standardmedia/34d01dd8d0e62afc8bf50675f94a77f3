Two senior officials at the county government were yesterday suspended indefinitely over delay to complete rehabilitation of roads under their jurisdiction. Governor Mwangi wa Iria suspended county Secretary for Transport and Infrastructure Amos Njoroge and Chief Officer Simon Thuku. The governor put on notice other senior employees in the county government to ensure projects under them are implemented in time or face the sack. &quot;All the employees must deliver according to the set time frame,&quot; he said. His action followed delay by the department of transport and infrastructure to put murram on roads that had been rehabilitated under the county&#39;s Sh1 billion programme. So far, 5,000 kilometres of road have been done in all the 35 wards. A further 350 kilometres of road will be rehabilitated before the onset of the rainy season.
