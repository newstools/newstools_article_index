The majority of Kenyans want President Uhuru Kenyatta to consult with Opposition leaders when it comes to picking new electoral commissioners, a new survey has revealed. This view is held by an overwhelming 67.3 per cent of Kenyans in seven out of the former eight provinces. Only Central region, where Uhuru comes from, is opposed to the view. Nearly two out of three Kenyans also support the resignation of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) team to allow for free, fair and credible polls. The support for resignation is lowest in Central at 44.7 per cent. According to the latest survey commissioned by Africa Centre for Open Governance (Africog) and conducted by research firm Infotrak, the support for consultation in appointing new IEBC commissioners is highest in CORD strongholds. Regionally, Coast leads in support of this view with 85.9 per cent followed by Nyanza and Western regions at 82.1 per cent and 69.3 per cent respectively. Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s Rift Valley turf also supports the need for consultation at 67.3 per cent. The Joint Parliamentary Select Committee on Electoral Reforms led by senators James Orengo and Kiraitu Murungi gave the President a free hand in appointing individuals from a pool of candidates picked by an IEBC selection panel.
