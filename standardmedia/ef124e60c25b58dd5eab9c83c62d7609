Hundreds of farmers contracted by Nzoia and Mumias sugar companies yesterday poured onto the streets protesting against cane poaching. And growers contracted by Mumias Sugar Company complained that the miller often delayed their payments and got cane from Nzoia Sugar Belt, which was promptly paid for. Marching through the streets of Harambee Market in Matungu, Nzoia farmers in turn accused Mumias Sugar Company of harvesting their cane without consent. When contacted for comment, Nzoia Sugar Company Public Relations Officer Gilbert Awino said Mumias was raiding from its (Nzoia&rsquo;s) zone even after the expiry of an agreement they had allowing cane harvesting. But Mumias Public Relations Officer Moses Owino denied the allegations of cane poaching and called on their contracted farmers to be patient as they worked out payment modalities. &ldquo;We have farmers contracted to us in Bungoma. Our employees are now accompanied by police because they were once attacked while harvesting our cane,&rdquo; noted Mr Owino. READ MORE Private sugar millers warned against poaching cane Julius Makomere, a farmer contracted by Mumias, said he had delivered cane to the factory but was yet to be paid. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t accept to be duped by Mumias yet they are making profit. They are making a killing from easy cane acquired from Nzoia solet them pay us on time,&rdquo; he said. Judith Shiundu from Panyako in Matungu said Mumias had made her poorer through the payment delays. &ldquo;The company has molested us. They are not paying us yet they are stealing cane from Nzoia region and paying those farmers promptly. We can&rsquo;t accept this; Mumias needs to change or we will uproot our cane,&rdquo; warned Ms Shiundu.
