An employee of a ranch in Laikipia East was shot dead by illegal herders who had invaded it. Edung Lepong&#39;oi, 50, was shot dead at&nbsp;Segera Ranch that has been in the spotlight over confrontations between herders and management. And following the Wednesday night attack, residents of Ngare Nyiro village blocked the entry to the ranch ostensibly to block the police from investigating the fatal shooting. Police claimed the herders raided the ranch at night with intentions of fleeing with hundreds of livestock, which had been detained due to illegal grazing. Laikipia East OCPD Zacheus Ng&#39;eno said the raiders sprayed bullets on two houses made of iron sheets. Lepong&#39;oi and six other guards were asleep in the houses. &quot;He was fatally injured and he died while undergoing treatment at the ranch&#39;s dispensary,&quot; said Mr Ng&#39;eno.

Another ranch worker and a teenager were shot dead in different circumstances in June, this year. Since mid-this year, armed herders have been invading the ranch in search of pastures for their livestock. This is despite a directive issued by Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet who ordered County Commander Angelus Karuru to take action against herders invading private ranches. And in July this year, illegal grazers allegedly shot and wounded&nbsp;Wachira Mwai, a nephew of former President Mwai Kibaki. The invasions by herders have heightened insecurity in the area.
