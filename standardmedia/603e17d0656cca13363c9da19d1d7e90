ODM Leader Mr&nbsp;Raila Odinga has rubbished the formation of the Jubilee Party saying it is inconsequential and an effort in futility. Speaking at Orange House today after holding a meeting with representatives of the Gusii Community in Nairobi,&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Odinga said he was unmoved by the political posturing and chest-thumping by the Jubilee administration saying it is the people who have the final say. &ldquo;I have visited all the parts of this country and learned that Kenyans are tired with this administration that thrives on public relations and buying people,&rdquo; said Mr&nbsp;Odinga. The former Prime Minister said the ODM was ready to face any challenge that will be brought by the Jubilee Party and reiterated that the opposition was equally prepared. &ldquo;We are seeing the opposition in town is trying to organise themselves, the message we are giving them is that we are ready for any challenge they might pose to us.&rdquo; Mr&nbsp;Odinga said ODM will not be shaken by the formation of the new party which he said was hot air and a mere ploy to try and reintroduce single party rule in Kenya. He said that&nbsp;ODM will continue to be the majority party in Nairobi.

I want it to be known that Kenyans are already united under ODM and CORD.&rdquo; Mr&nbsp;Odinga added that ODM was the biggest party in Kenya membership from every community in the country. He said Jubilee was just a tribal party with no bearing. &ldquo;As social democrats, we will continue to unite every Kenyan in readiness for the general election,&rdquo; said Mr&nbsp;Odinga. On IEBC reforms, Mr&nbsp;Odinga said one year was enough to make changes in the electoral body, prepare a new voter register and conduct an election. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need five years to do this,&rdquo;&nbsp;he added. The ODM leader opposed plans to introduce a legislation in parliament to compel people who lose in party primaries to support the winner and prevent them from joining other parties. &ldquo;When one joins a party, they do so knowing that they are in that party because of its ideology and policies,&rdquo; he said adding that, &ldquo;if one loses in the nominations, it is common sense that they support the winner in the interest of the party, you don&rsquo;t need a legislation on this.&rdquo; He said he will continue to engage directly with the people with the aim of ensuring the growth of the party in the grassroots. The delegation was led by Chairman of the Gusii Community in Nairobi Mr&nbsp;Joseph Nyandika who said the community was solidly in ODM and behind Mr&nbsp;Odinga&rsquo;s candidacy.
