&nbsp; {Photo:Courtesy} Pretoria:Fezekile Kuzwayo, who accused South Africa&#39;s President Jacob Zuma of rape 10 years ago in a high-profile case in the country, died on Saturday, her family said. Fezekile, known to South Africans as &quot;Khwezi&quot; to protect her identity after multiple threats and insults, accused Zuma of rape in 2006 before he became president. The HIV-positive activist grew up around Zuma, who had spent about 10 years in Robben Island prison with her father, a member of the African National Congress (ANC). &quot;It is with our deepest sorrow that the Kuzwayo family announces the passing of our daughter Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo,&quot; Fezekile&#39;s mother Beauty Sibongile Kuzwayo said in a statement on Sunday without giving details on the cause of her death. Zuma was acquitted in the case, keeping alive his hopes of becoming president, which he did in 2009.
