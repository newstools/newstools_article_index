A time to be born and a time to die, but&nbsp;Masha&rsquo;s&nbsp;death has shocked many and that is why we want to know the true cause of his death to avoid speculations,&rdquo; said the governor. He&nbsp;called&nbsp;for patience to allow police to carry out comprehensive investigations. &ldquo;Prominent Kenyans have died before under mysterious circumstances and none of their investigations have ever been made public.
