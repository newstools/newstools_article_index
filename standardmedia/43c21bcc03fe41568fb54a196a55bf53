Orange Democratic Movement ODM is now demanding for unconditional release of Nyando MP Fred Outa, insisting that it is his role to articulate issues and matters affecting his constituents. &ldquo;ODM has learnt with concern the arrest and subsequent detention of the Hon. Fred Outa, the Member of Parliament for Nyando by Police in Kisumu for allegedly inciting students of Ahero Girls High School to protest against the transfer of their Principal,&rdquo; said the acting ODM secretary general Agnes Zani in a press statement. Senator Zani said the school falls within Mr. Outa&rsquo;s constituency and it is his responsibility to articulate issues and matters that affect his constituents. &ldquo;Schools are not prisons where people are barred from entering to have issues addressed, they are public institutions and we find it absolutely improper for the state agencies to be used to harass a Member of Parliament out to seek clarification on a matter of concern.&rdquo; &ldquo;As a party, we demand the unconditional release of Hon. Outa or be granted a cash bail which is a constitutional right as the matter is being handled. As leader, Hon. Outa has a role in ensuring quality academic standards are set and the realization of good performance in institutions of learning in his area of jurisdiction.&rdquo; READ MORE Nyando MP arrested for alleged incitement of students to protest principal's removal Governor Mvurya under pressure after defecting to Jubilee ODM in door-to-door campaign against Jubilee
