Two&nbsp;roadside&nbsp;births&nbsp;were reported yesterday, as the health workers strike entered its second day. A woman gave&nbsp;birth&nbsp;at Kirindine in Tigania West as the workers stayed away from Miathene Hospital. Three ambulances were seen transferring patients to private hospitals. As the patients suffered, the striking workers gathered at the hospital&#39;s compound to chart the way forward while the top management also held a meeting. Several patients were transferred to other facilities but others remained in the wards to be attended to by some nurses who chose to work. Some 2,000 health workers are on a strike to protest the county government&#39;s failure to implement several agreements including promotion of 1,200 workers and a pay rise. Japhet and Mary Kinyua, who have a sick child opted to look for help elsewhere. &quot;He has TB and is not doing well. His cough has worsened, so we decided to transfer him to another facility,&quot; said Kinyua. As patients suffer, there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. &quot;There has not been any discussion between the Executive and us. They have not made any efforts to reach us to end the stand-off. We will stay away from our work stations until progress is made to meet our demands,&quot; said Mugambi Bakari from the Kenya National Union of Nurses-Meru branch.
