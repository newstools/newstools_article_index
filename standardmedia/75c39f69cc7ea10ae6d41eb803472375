The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has mobilised its top officials in a battle to retain political supremacy in Kisii. The party is pulling out all the stops to win the Nyacheki ward by-election slated for October 26, 2016. The by-election was occasioned by the death of Peter Ongeri, who was the ward representative, on July 27. ODM, which won the seat in the 2013 elections, will be trying to retain it amid a growing Jubilee Party wave in the county. The Orange party is leaving nothing to chance and is said to be conducting door-to-door campaigns before switching to public rallies. Top officials have already been dispatched to drum up support for Naftal Onkoba. Last week, the party sent chairman John Mbadi (Suba MP) and nominated Senator Janet Ongera to join the candidate on the campaign trail. According to Mr Mbadi, the Nyacheki by-election results will be a reflection of the 2017 general election.
