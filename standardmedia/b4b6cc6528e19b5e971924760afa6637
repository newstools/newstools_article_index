An MCA who stripped naked a year ago to show displeasure over a tweet allegedly posted by Deputy President William Ruto has apologised. Central Gem MCA Fred Ouda yesterday obeyed a directive from the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko to apologise. &ldquo;Because I am a law-abiding citizen and I respect the rule of law and the offices that gave the directive, I am very sorry to anyone who felt aggrieved by my actions,&rdquo; he said. Mr Ouda said although his conscience did not stalk him for his conduct, he respected the public order to apoligise.
