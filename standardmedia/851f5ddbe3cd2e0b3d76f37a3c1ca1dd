Jubilee Party could announce its interim officials as soon as this week. This is after a delegation that went to China returns this week to avert infighting, which is threatening to tear the newly-launched party apart. Jubilee merger co-chairman Noah Wekesa yesterday warned that the ongoing infighting due to a leadership vacuum in the new outfit could worsen should President Uhuru Kenyatta and deputy William Ruto delay installation of officials. Dr Wekesa indicated a team could be picked by this week after the party&#39;s steering committee that had been sent to China returns. The party on whose ticket President Kenyatta will seek re-election, had last week sent two teams to China to learn party management skills from Communist Party of China. The teams were led by merger co-chair Kiraitu Murungi, former National Alliance Secretary General Onyango Oloo and Lee Karuri.
