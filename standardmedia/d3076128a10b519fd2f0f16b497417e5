The High Court in Mombasa has ruled that&nbsp;extradition&nbsp;proceedings&nbsp;against&nbsp;an Italian fugitive should proceed despite his ill health. Leone Alberto Fulvio&nbsp;has lived as a free man in Kenya since 1993 despite an eight year conviction in Italy for drugs related charges. Lady Justice Dorcas Chepkwony&nbsp;also ruled that Fulvio, 67, who was arrested on September 26 after Interpol and Italian authorities blew his cover, should be held under armed guard at Oasis Medical Centre in Kilifi County to enable him recover sufficiently for the&nbsp;extradition&nbsp;proceedings to start. The Italian was presented to the public for the first time yesterday briefly following a Tuesday order by the judge. His lawyer Gikandi Ngibuini&rsquo;s application for bond was rejected by Lady Justice Chepkwony who said she had no jurisdiction to hear the same when the matter was properly before the magistrate&rsquo;s court. &ldquo;I do not know why this man was arrested. What I know is that the police want him to go under the process of&nbsp;extraditionand as such I cannot make any other order apart from what I said on Tuesday that once the doctor certifies he has recovered he can now be taken to the court having jurisdiction to hear&nbsp;extradition&nbsp;proceedings&nbsp;against&nbsp;him,&rdquo; she said. Fulvio, who was aided by two armed policemen and his daughter, sat in the open court briefly before he was ushered into the judge&rsquo;s chamber for the proceedings.

Interpol and Italian prosecutors want Fulvio&nbsp;extradited&nbsp;to Torino in Italy to start serving a sentence of 8 years, 9 months and 18 days imposed by a court on January 29 1992. Police and Immigration officials&rsquo; conduct in this&nbsp;case&nbsp;is now a matter of concern following revelations that apart from not serving his sentence, he fled to Kenya in 1993, renounced Italian citizenship on December 15 2009, became a Kenyan citizen and acquired Identity Card Number 28622187. Certificate of good conduct The police certificate of good conduct issued on January 20 states that Kenyan Criminal Investigation Department CID issued it after finding that&nbsp;Fulvio&rsquo;s fingerprints did not turn up any criminal record after being run through CID&rsquo;s database. But an affidavit sworn by Chief Inspector of Police John Lelei attached to Interpol in Nairobi on October 5 shows that &ldquo;in the course of my duties at Interpol bureau in Nairobi I got information that one Alberto Fulvio was wanted in Italy and a Red Notice had been published in the Interpol website.&rdquo; GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
