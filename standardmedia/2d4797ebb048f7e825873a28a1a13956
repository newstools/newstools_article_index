KAKAMEGA: Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli on Sunday met Luhya elders in his latest efforts to ensure western Kenya fields one presidential candidate next year. Speaking in Khwisero, Kakamega County, Atwoli said he is consulting leaders and stakeholders across the political divide. &quot;Some people have said we cannot unite. That is a misplaced theory. We are already succeeding and I am committed to the course 100 per cent,&#39;&#39; he said. The elders led by Phillip Masinde, a former Cabinet minister, had a lengthy discussion with Atwoli over the direction the community will take in the forthcoming General Elections. Atwoli, however said some elders from the region don&#39;t have the interests of the community at heart and are driven by greed for money&nbsp; Last month, the Luhya Elders Forum denounced Senator Moses Wetang&#39;ula and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi presidential bids.
