Reports that MPs have ganged up to force through an amendment on party-hopping in the Elections Laws (Amendment) Bill 2016 is ominous. Granted, the choice to associate with whichever party one chooses is a democratic right. Yet it is easy to see where the proponents of the clause; President Kenyatta and CORD leader Raila, are coming from. The chaotic nature of our democracy is such that those holding the lowest ideals are celebrated; those quick to denounce sworn ideals, switch allegiance at the snap of a finger and trumpet what they denounced a while ago carry the day. The corollary is that politics and parties are vehicles for self-promotion and aggrandisement. The MPs&rsquo; fear of being short-changed in a one-shot party primary are legitimate. Some have been short-changed before. But then, should we compromise the quest for functional democracy because of a few cases? Not at all. Those with misgivings should strive to be heard within those parties. Party-hopping will not, of itself, cure the inadequacies inherent in parties. In any case, parties are publicly funded; too many splinter outfits deplete funds meant to build capacity and structures that ensure parties are democratic enough and thereby contest over ideas and offer a viable alternative for both candidates and voters.
