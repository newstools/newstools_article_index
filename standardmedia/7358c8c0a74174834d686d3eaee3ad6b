Chemelil Sugar Company has shut its factory for repairs to boost sugar production efficiency. The company&rsquo;s managing director, Charles Owele, said the manufacturing plant in Muhoroni would be closed for five weeks for annual maintenance. It was shut down over the weekend. The plant recently started a third production shift in response to the demand for its brown sugar. The maintenance work, which will include major rehabilitation of gantry cranes, mills and the factory&rsquo;s four boilers, is expected to increase Chemelil&rsquo;s factory capacity by more than 70 per cent. The company embarked on the maintenance after receiving a loan of Sh265 million from the Sugar Directorate, part of which will go towards offsetting the Sh198 million it owes farmers. &mdash; Kepher Otieno &nbsp; READ MORE Muhoroni Youth protest against 'mistreatment' Barclays Bank half-year profit drops by 10per cent Limping Leopards to meet Omino&rsquo;s red-hot Stima: Bruised Ingwe visit Stima as Chemelil head to Ulinzi
