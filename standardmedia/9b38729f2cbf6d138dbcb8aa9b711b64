MACHAKOS: Senator James Orengo has praised Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, describing him as &quot;the most trusted leader&quot; among all Kenyan politicians. Speaking yesterday at a church service at the Africa Inland Church Bomani in Machakos town, Orengo said Kalonzo had distinguished himself as a true nationalist, who does not carry the burden of tribal baggage. &quot;The time we&#39;ll end tribalism in Kenya is when we will get the right leaders and I can confidently say before this congregation that Kalonzo is the most God fearing leader in the country,&quot; said the Siaya senator. Orengo, who was hosted by Senator Johnstone Muthama, asked the faithful to be on the front line in supporting leaders who have a track record of consistency in service to humanity. He said the recent changes to election laws and the reconstitution of IEBC will ensure free and fair elections in 2017.
