&nbsp; The third anniversary of the Westgate terror attack was marked without major activities Wednesday. It was business as usual at the mall. Traders said their businesses are picking up due to improved security. &quot;Security has improved and we are getting more customers as compared to last year. But this issue is not confined to Kenya, you can see it in other parts of the world,&quot; said a trader on the second floor, the epicentre of the attack on September 21, 2013. At the mall, security has been heightened with more police deployments. Journalists visited the mall to check if there were any activities to mark the day, but there was none. The management allowed the scribes into the mall to asses the progress. Traders spoke freely calling for continued vigilance to tame any such planned attack.
