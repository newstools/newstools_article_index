With the Nov. 8 election now only weeks away and polls turning against him, Trump is spending precious time in campaign speeches defending himself from accusations from several women who say he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. What he would do if elected is covered, but much of his speeches are spent belittling his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He also accuses the U.S. news media of a plot to bring him down, and charges that the women who have made the accusations against him might be doing it for a taste of fame. Opinion polls show a gloomy picture for Trump. A week after a video surfaced of him bragging in lewd terms about groping women, the latest Reuters-Ipsos poll on Friday showed Clinton up, with 44 percent to Trump&#39;s 37 percent. And the crowds have gotten more protective of their hero. One woman at a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Thursday wore a homemade T-shirt that said &quot;Trump Can Grab My,&quot; with an arrow pointing to her crotch.

Both were ejected. Trump&#39;s message has gotten through to his supporters in a big way about Clinton, who Trump calls a criminal for her handling of classified information as secretary of state. &quot;She would be the most dishonest and corrupt ever elected to high office,&quot; he said. &nbsp; &#39;SO JADED ALREADY&#39; A crowd of young voters had a ready response when he brought up Clinton at an event in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. &quot;Lock her up!&quot; they chanted, mimicking the lines voiced by older voters at other events.
