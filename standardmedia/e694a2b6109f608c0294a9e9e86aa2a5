Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula has dismissed claims of discord in CORD and maintained the opposition leaders are united to the end. Wetang&#39;ula said CORD is experiencing a political process where all the three principals cannot speak the same language all the time but have modalities of arriving at a consensus. Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ODM&#39;s Raila Odinga and Wetang&#39;ula have all sworn to fly the coalition&#39;s flag as the preferred candidate for presidency in the next year&rsquo;s election. &quot;We have unity of purpose. Our main aim is to wrestle Jubilee government out of power. We know where we have come from and we know where we are going together as Cord co-principals,&quot; said Wetang&#39;ula. He added, &quot;Having come this far together as CORD principals, Kenyans should not be worried of any discord. It is not easy when all of us believe we are strong candidates to represent the coalition in the next general election.&quot; The Bungoma senator addressed journalists at Sosa Cottages after meeting delegations of Vihiga County elders for a consultative forum.

Wetang&#39;ula said the three principals are in competition and all believe they are capable of carrying the mantle of the coalition forward. &quot;We are looking for a stress free mechanism to reach out for our candidate. A team is working on modalities of arriving at the candidate,&quot; he said. He revealed the team from Ford Kenya that has been selected to work on the selection of CORD&#39;s candidate includes Kakamega senator Bonny Khalwale, Eseli Simiyu (Tongaren MP), Chris Wamalwa (Kiminini MP) and Cynthia Mutere. The Senate minority leader further revealed that whatever will be the case in selection of their candidate, they will put an eye on the ball which is leadership of the country. &quot;Already we have strong pillars to build a house, why should we go for weaker pillars that will build a weak house,&quot; he said.
