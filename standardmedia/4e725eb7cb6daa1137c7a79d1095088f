A group of women Monday demonstrated against two ODM leaders for allegedly disrespecting Governor Salim Mvurya. According to the protesters, women reps Aisha Jumwa (Kilifi) and Mishi Mboko (Mombasa) sang dirges at a recent rally attended by Opposition leader Raila Odinga. The demonstrators said this was meant to demean Governor Mvurya. The two were among other leaders led by Raila and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho who attacked Mvurya last Friday for ditching the Orange party for Jubilee. Ms Jumwa led others in singing a &quot;sendoff&quot; song for Mvurya which the women said was disrespectful. Carrying placards and leaves, the women dismissed anyone wanting to dictate to them concerning county matters. Asha Makei from Msambweni said it was time neighbouring counties stopped interfering in Kwale matters.
