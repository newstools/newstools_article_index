Turkey has issued an arrest warrant for its former international football star striker Hakan Sukur in the probe over the failed July 15 coup aimed at unseating President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a report said Friday. Sukur is accused by prosecutors of &quot;being a member of an armed terror group&quot;, a reference to the organisation of the US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen who Ankara claims was behind the coup, state-run Anadolu news agency said. It added that Sukur and his family had left Turkey last year.
