Masinga MP Itwiku Mbai seeking to have a State corporation forced to give locals 1,000 acres of land around the Seven Forks Scheme. He wants the National Assembly to force Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) to give out the land arguing the firm is not using it. &quot;Most of the land KenGen owns in Embu and Machakos counties remains idle and should therefore be given out to residents to start economic activities,&quot; Mbai said. The MP spoke when KenGen commissioned projects worth Sh69.7million in Masinga and Mbeere South constituencies. The company owns 12,000 acres of land around the Seven Forks Scheme.
