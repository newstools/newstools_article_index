Democratic Party (DP) will not join Jubilee Party but will support President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election bid next year. The party&rsquo;s national officials announced on Saturday that DP will field candidates in all elective posts except the presidency. Speaking when they officially opened Embu County branch office in Runyenjes, DP national chairman Esau Kioni however invited President Kenyatta to vie on its ticket. &ldquo;DP policies are well known since they were the same used by former President Mwai Kibaki to achieve development projects during his 10-year-tenure. We call on Kenyans to embrace the party in the grassroots,&rdquo; Mr Kioni said.
