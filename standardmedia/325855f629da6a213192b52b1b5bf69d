The Mosiro Ward by-election will provide an opportunity for Jubilee Party to gauge it popularity ahead of the General Election. Kajiado West MP Moses ole Sakuda, who is leading the campaigns, is optimistic the area will deliver the first JP MCA come October 26. Mr Sakuda (above) believes residents will vote for Jubilee&rsquo;s&nbsp;Jonathan Koroine citing government development projects in the area. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way the people of Mosiro will vote for the opposition with all these development projects being initiated by the government,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;He cited the electrification project launched in the area recently by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto as one of the initiatives that will determine the election outcome. The seat fell vacant following the death of MCA Peter Kurrinyo of ODM. Jubilee&rsquo;s Mr Koroine will battle it out with Peter Tirishe of ODM. Kajiado Senator Peter Mositet, who has camped in Mosiro, said he was determined to deliver the seat to Jubilee. &nbsp;&ldquo;My team and I have decided to camp here until the by-election is over. We will try our best to deliver the first seat to our new party,&rdquo; said Mositet. But the ODM brigade, led by Governor David Nkedianye, has vowed to recapture the seat. The governor said they will not be intimidated by government machinery or propaganda in their quest to retain the seat.
