Registrar of Political Parties Lucy Ndung&#39;u has confirmed that the Party of National Unity (PNU) was dissolved on Friday to join Jubilee Party. Ms Ndung&#39;u said yesterday her office received the merger instruments signed by the party&#39;s chairman, John Kamaman and Organising Secretary Alphonse Musyoki. &quot;PNU held its National Delegates Convention on Friday morning and dissolved to join Jubilee Party. I have the merger instrument signed by PNU officials,&quot; said Ndung&#39;u. But PNU Secretary General John Okemwa has insisted that the party,&nbsp;associated with retired President Mwai Kibaki, had not dissolved to join the new outfit to be used by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto for re-election in 2017. Mr Okemwa said proper procedure was not followed in convening the party&#39;s NDC so the process was illegal. He said PNU would hold its delegates conference on October 28 to make a decision on the political path to take but maintained that joining Jubilee was not on the table.
