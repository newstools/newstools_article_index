CORD leader&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;Odinga wants&nbsp;lawyers&nbsp;to rise up against oppression and social injustice, and says the Jubilee administration is undermining free speech. Addressing&nbsp;lawyers&nbsp;during the annual Law Society of Kenya (LSK) conference at Leisure Lodge resort in Kwale County yesterday,&nbsp;Raila&nbsp;said the upsurge of&nbsp;extrajudicial killings should concern members of the bar.&nbsp; He warned&nbsp;lawyers&nbsp;that if they remained silent, they too could become victims of State intolerance. &ldquo;Many Kenyans are being arrested because of what they post on Facebook and Twitter and it is only a handful of&nbsp;lawyers&nbsp;who stand with them,&rdquo; he said He noted that in the past the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) had fought against subjugation, and asked them to renew their commitment to speak out against social injustice as oppression does not discriminate and anyone can be a target. &ldquo;For the first time I recently saw&nbsp;lawyers&nbsp;in the streets when one of their own was brutally killed,&rdquo; the CORD leader said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lawyers&nbsp;must speak out against the retrogressive policies of the Jubilee government.&rdquo; Plunder of public resources READ MORE Anxiety in CORD over Mudavadi, Kalonzo ticket Lynched Nyamira man drank children&rsquo;s blood, kin say It pays to make a dignified exit and find an escape route Raila&nbsp;repeated his criticism of the Independent Election and Boundaries Commission (IEBC)&nbsp; and said the high amounts of funding caps it had set was designed to encourage Jubilee leaders to plunder public resources in the run up to the 2017 elections. He accused IEBC&nbsp;&mdash; whose chairman Isaack Hassan was present at the conference &mdash;of gazetting the figures at the behest of the Jubilee administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;If you look at our economy then it is crazy for someone to spend Sh5 billion. They (IEBC) cannot even come to me and ask how much I previously spent&nbsp;&mdash; to set a bench mark&nbsp;&mdash; because I have been a presidential candidate before, but off course the regulations were drawn by Jubilee,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Raila. &nbsp;The former Prime Minister&nbsp; noted that most major scandals&nbsp;unfold a few months before&nbsp;elections.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the country begins to prepare for elections you will see big scandals preceding the polls and already you can see what is happening at the IEBC,&rdquo; he said. &quot;We are in the middle of debate about how to reform IEBC and I am happy that Mr Hassan is in the audience. It is strong institutions that ensure good governance,&quot; he said. GO TO PAGE 1 2 Next &raquo;
