Today, at the age of 92, Mugabe is totally useless, as would be the case with any nonagenarian great grandparent. The book also highlights Mugabe s alleged concerted efforts in stifling the media, building the Gushungo dynasty, manipulation of Christians and Mujuru s strategy to rescue Zimbabweans. Mourners are gathered at number 10 Bangala Street, Rhodene in Masvingo, and burial arrangements are yet to be announced.
