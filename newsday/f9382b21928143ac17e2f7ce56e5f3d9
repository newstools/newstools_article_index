GWERU upcoming musician, Alei has started his music career with a bang by collaborating with award-winning artistes in a bid to make an instant impression on the industry. BY SINDISO DUBEThe 23-year-old rapper has collaborated with award-winning rapper and producer, Ti Gonzi and Anonzi Xnder as well as Star FM DJ JBoss, Tricky J, Styce and South Africa-based Gt Beats on a track Bho Zvekuti remix.Bho Zvekuti is a street lingo for It s all good or it s okay and the track talks about living a stress-free life in the spirit of loving.The track was produced by the reigning best Zim hip-hop producer of the year, Anonzi Xnder (real name Alexander Mutumwa). I had to rope in the big guys, who are already in the industry, so that they guide me in this difficult field. Xnder is well-known for producing hit singles that explains my working with him, TI Gonzi is not new at making headlines and also awards, that also includes Tricky J, JBoss, and Stacey, Alei said. It s hard rising up as a newcomer. That s why I had to stand with my brothers in music for guidance. After collaborating with them many have been paying attention to my works now and I have seen a sudden change from the music I used to produce before incorporating the big guys. Born Alei Mnhangu in Gweru, the musician went to Mkoba 1 High School, where he started doing music in the school choir before he released his first single, Havafare, followed by Bho Zvekuti, which has received rave reviews online.
