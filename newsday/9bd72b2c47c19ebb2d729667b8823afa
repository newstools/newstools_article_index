THE Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has taken the Public Service Commission (PSC) to court over unremitted membership subscriptions amounting to $60 677. BY CHARLES LAITONIn summons filed at the High Court on September 23 under case number HC9700/16, the ZCTU claims the debt dates back four years ago. The defendant (PSC) was affiliated to the plaintiff (ZCTU) for the period ending August 31, 2016 and was, therefore, bound by the ZCTU s constitution for the duration of its affiliation, ZCTU said in its declaration.The labour umbrella body said clause 7 (5) of its constitution binds all its members to pay their dues at an amount and in a manner prescribed by the general council at any given time of which the subscription amount per month per member which PSC was supposed to contribute was $0,35. The defendant failed to adhere to the terms pertaining to its affiliation by failing to pay the affiliation fees due to the plaintiff. As a result of its failure to pay its dues from January 2012 to September 2016, the defendant now owes plaintiff a total of $60 677, ZCTU said.The labour umbrella body further said it had made various attempts to have the money paid by the Ministry of Public Service, but the latter failed to do so citing declining membership and low revenue streams. Despite demand, the defendant has failed, neglected and/or refused to pay their outstanding balance of $60 677, which amount has been outstanding since June 21, 2016 and is now overdue and owing. However, the PSC has since entered an appearance to defend notice and is geared to challenge the claims as and when the matter would be set down for trial.
