AN assistant inspector with the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) stationed at Redcliff, Norest Zindoga, has taken to the stage, recording an enchanting gospel album, Rumbidza Mwari. BY FLATA KAVINGAThe seven-track effort, which was recorded at Voice of Thunder Studios in Chitungwiza in November last year, is already enjoying airplay on local radio stations.Zindoga said he chose to record a gospel album because he was an elder in the Zaoga Forward in Faith Ministries Church. I grew up in church and I used to participate in the praise and worship team from 1999, he said, adding that he developed a passiong for music since his years at primary school in Chikomba, Chivhu.Zindoga said during training at ZRP Morris Depot from June up to December in 2006, he was also a member of the police band. In 2015, I met a friend, Ophiro Kumutsana, who introduced me to Gibson Makumbe, who then helped me to record Rumbidza Mwari, he said.Other songs on the album, apart from the title track, are Mhururu, Ndasimudza Mese, Wandisimudzira, Zvipo, Wakatendeka and Mweya Mutsvene.The musician said he used digital music, but fused the song Wakatendeka with a live lead guitar. On my second album, I will be using live instruments because I have noticed that the output on digital music is not very clear, as compared to using live instruments. In terms of holding live shows, fans prefer live instruments ahead of digital music, Zindoga said.He said as a Chaplain in the police force, he still conducted morning devotions and lunch hour services.Zindoga said he was already working on a video for the album.
