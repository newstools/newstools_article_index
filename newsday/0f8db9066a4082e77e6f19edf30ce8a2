LOCAL fuel firm, Stadic Petroleum (Pvt) (Ltd), had its charge of selling contaminated fuel withdrawn on Tuesday after the Standards Association of Zimbabwe (SAZ) cleared it of any wrongdoing. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEThe company, through its representative Augustine Mahwana, had denied the charge, arguing that the fuel samples which formed the basis of the State case were not credible. The samples were collected by the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority in the absence of the firm s representatives.Provincial magistrate Tendai Mahwe then dismissed the matter after a retest of the fuel indicated that there were no contaminants.The State had alleged that on June 28 this year, an informant, in the company of officials from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Air force of Zimbabwe and the National Economic Conduct Inspectorate, visited Stadic Petroleum s premises to inquire whether the firm was complying with the Petroleum Act and Regulations.The State alleges the team took three diesel samples from the fuel pumps for tests at the SAZ for verification, and results indicated that the diesel contained some impurities.The fuel dealer, however, disputed the results, culminating in fresh tests.Francisca Mukumbiri represented the State.
