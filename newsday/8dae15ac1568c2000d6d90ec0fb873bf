BY CHARLES LAITONAs part of his bail conditions, Ishmael Kauzani, who is being represented by the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) s Andrew Makoni, was ordered to surrender his passport, report to Harare Central Police Station s Law and Order section every Monday and Friday and not interfere with State witnesses.But Petros Sokole and 57 others, as well as Bulawayo MDC-T youth secretary Kunashe Muchemwa, who were also arrested and charged with public violence over demonstrations that were conducted by members of the National Electoral Reform Agenda against police brutality, will have to endure another weekend behind bars after High Court judge Justice Happias Zhou postponed the hearing to Tuesday.The postponements were occasioned by the non-availability of the State s response to the bail application.The High Court also postponed to Monday the bail hearing of a matter involving Tinotenda Mhungu and 12 others, who were also arrested and charged with public violence over demonstrations that rocked the city last month.All the suspects are being represented by ZLHR lawyers Jeremiah Bamu and Trust Maanda, together with Harare lawyer Charles Chikowore.
