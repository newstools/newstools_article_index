SUNGURA kingpin Alick Macheso will feature on Pengaudzoke s new album to be released soon. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA Alick MachesoThe six-track album, which is Pengaudzoke s debut under Faheem Somanje, following the death of Daiton, is being recorded at Macheso s Alema Studios.Faheem confirmed that the Extrabasso as Macheso is affectionately known was featured on the song, Nhaka, where he provided some vocals. I feel so happy because Macheso is a legend. I am grateful to do a collaboration with him. This means that the final product will be good because of the assistance I am getting from the legend, Faheem said.The yet-to-be-named album has tracks Zai Regondo, Linda, Ndoda Kuroora, Daka, Nhaka and Kumaunde.Faheem said he was about to complete recording the album, which will be used to measure if he had managed to fill in his late father s big shoes. The young musician has been focusing on live shows in which he also played renditions of his father s songs. The album is almost complete. I cannot give the actual date of the launch. As it stands, we are left with doing vocals on two songs. I could have finished recording two weeks ago, but because we had a number of shows across the country, we did not have enough time to do so. I am confident that this week, I will do the vocals, he said.After the death of Daiton early last year, Macheso adopted Faheem who has since become a curtain raiser at his live shows. The sungura giant also offered Pengaudzoke a free recording contract.
