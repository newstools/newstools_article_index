ONE of the country s top comedians, Doc Vikela, has described comedy as the spice of life, which helped relieve people of stress, while at the same time unpacking governance issues at a higher level through fits of laughter. BY LORRAINE MUROMODoc VikelaIn a wide-ranging interview with NewsDay following his return from Botswana, where he staged comedy shows, the award-winning comedian said comedy also helped to break the ground for discussing sensitive matters in a light-hearted manner.Doc Vikela said he enjoyed himself at the Gaborone International Music and Culture Festival held over four days, adding that he picked up a few precious lessons in the process. It was an awesome experience. My humour was appreciated like never before and the audience totally loved my set. They were with me all the way and I felt more at home, the comedian said. Comedy relieves stress. It also takes a dig on the day-to-day issues in a higher manner. It provokes debate and humbles oppression. Doc Vikela challenged stakeholders in the local comedy industry to embrace high levels of professionalism so that the sector would be taken seriously. While in Botswana, the greatest lesson I got hold of was professionalism. Comedy needs undivided attention in a bid to succeed. Most of the comedians there shared their experiences in the business and I realised that as Zimbabwe, we still have a long way to go, he said. Some of the artists that took to the stage with the Zimbabwean comedian included Salvado from Uganda, Trevor Gumbi and Lihle from South Africa backed with local acts.Doc Vikela also promised fans to expect great performances at the Shoko Festival from September 23 to 25 and the Intwasa Festival from September 26 to October 21.Born Victor Mpofu, Doc Vikela co-founded Simuka Comedy with fellow top comedian, Simba the Comic King. Ugandan comedy queen, Anne Kansiime, has described him as one of Africa s finest comedians.
