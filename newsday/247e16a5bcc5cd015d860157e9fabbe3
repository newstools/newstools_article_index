THE whistle-blower in the match-fixing trial of former Zifa boss, Henrietta Rushwaya, Leeroy Waguta, yesterday told the court under cross-examination, that fixing matches and football betting was his livelihood. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEWaguta is the main State witness in the match-fixing trial involving Rushwaya, former Zifa board member, Edzai Kasinauyo and ex-Warriors assistant coach, Nation Dube.Waguta told the court he lost count of how much money he had received from Rushwaya to throw South Africa topflight league matches.Upon being asked about his relationship with Rushwaya by defence lawyer, Simon Mupindu, Waguta said he knew her since 2008, when he worked as the manager of Benjani Mwaruwari&#8217;s immovable property in South Africa.Waguta said Rushwaya invited him to Maslow Hotel in Sandton, Johannesburg, South Africa, where she promised him a job as a runner , as she had found investors, who were into soccer betting. After I agreed to work with her, she gave me $2 000 for shopping and she told me the first assignment was to approach University of Pretoria goalkeeper, Washington Arubi, whom they wanted to fix the match against Free State Stars, he said. I met Arubi with a view to persuade him to compromise his performance in the match against Free State Stars and she had given me $8 000. On approaching Arubi, he vehemently refused and even threatened to assault me. Waguta further told the court that on January 23 this year, they fixed a match between Bloemfontein Celtics and Free State Stars after paying the former s goalkeeper, Patrick Tignyemb $15 000, and midfielder Phalane $10 000. Bloemfontein Celtics lost 1-0.Waguta said Rushwaya gave him money to give to players such as Chippa United defender, Mbuyiso Sambo, ($8 000) on February 20 this year, Polokwane City goalkeeper, George Chigova $15 000 and defender Lebohang Motami $10 000 to lose against Bidvest Wits.He further told the court that he confided the plan to fix the Zimbabwe-Swaziland Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers to Warriors coach, Kalisto Pasuwa because he was his late father&#8217;s friend.During cross-examination, defence lawyer Harrison Nkomo asked Waguta if he was going to fix the match had the matter not been reported, to which he replied he would have proceeded with the plan, as he needed the money.On the Zimbabwe-Swaziland matches, Waguta said the three players, who were to be selected to fix the matches were to receive between $15 000 and $20 000, while Rushwaya, Kasinauyo, Ian Gorowa and Dube would receive $40 000 each, with him earning R100 000.On a different matter, Waguta told the court he, at some point, clashed with Mwaruwari after he (Waguta) accommodated Raji Perumal, a convicted match fixer, at Mwaruwari&#8217;s residence.&#8220;I was staying with Raji Perumal at Benjani&#8217;s residence without his approval, after he came with Rushwaya and they gave me R780 000, which was meant for the Zimbabwe-Brazil match &#8230; and Zimbabwe were supposed to lose 3-0,&#8221; Waguta said.The trial will continue on November 23.
