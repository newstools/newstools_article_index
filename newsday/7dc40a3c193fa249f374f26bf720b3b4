CHARLES Manyuchi s World Boxing Council (WBC) welterweight silver title voluntary defence fight against Frenchman Damien Martin set for October 14 at the Harare International Conference (HICC) could be rescheduled again to a later date after, it emerged that the proposed venue will not be available on the night. BY HENRY MHARAThe fight was initially set for September 30 at the HICC, but had to be delayed by two weeks to give Manyuchi s handlers, Oriental Quarries Boxing Promotions, enough time to market the highly-anticipated bout.It would be the first time the boxing superstar would be competing in such a high-profile fight on home soil.He has fought all his continental and world fights either in Zambia, where his handlers are based, or Europe.However, it appears his local fans, most of whom have not managed to watch their hero live, will have to wait a little longer, as it emerged that the HICC would be booked for a music concert on the same night that the Manyuchi/Damien fight has been scheduled. The venue hosts a music show featuring Jamaican reggae outfit, Morgan Heritage and local superstars Oliver Mutukudzi and Winky D.Show organisers, 2 Kings Entertainment, have already confirmed the gig. Everything is under control. All the payments and papers have been done, so we expect a big show and we call upon all reggae lovers to throng the place in their numbers, one of the organisers, Dee Nosh told NewsDay.Morgan Heritage have also confirmed their performance through their official Twitter account.Oriental Quarries Boxing Promotions, through their operations director, Christopher Malunga, were yet to respond to questions sent to them yesterday at the time of going to print.It is highly likely though, that the match could be moved to a later date.The budget for the match has been set at $172 000, a target that Malunga is confident they will meet.A fight against Damien serves as a warm-up to Manyuchi s mandatory title defence fight.The Manyuchi camp has not officially announced an opponent for the fight, but the boxer has hinted on a possible rematch with Russian pugilist, Dmitry Mikhaylenko.
