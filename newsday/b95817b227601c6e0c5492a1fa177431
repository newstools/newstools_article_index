An electricity transformer that exploded at Gweru s main water source, Gwenoro Dam on Monday, has left many parts of the city without water, with residents resorting to boreholes and unprotected wells for the precious liquid. BY Stephen ChadengaA snap survey by this paper revealed that residents, particularly in high-density areas have been jostling to fetch water from the city s few boreholes.Acting town clerk Edgar Mwedzi confirmed that the water shortages were caused by an electrical fault at Gwenoro water treatment plant. The dry taps are a result of a transformer that blew (sic) on Monday. Zesa is attending to the transformer and we are not sure when they will finish the job so that normal water supplies can resume to residents. The transformer explosion follows another electric fault, which was attended to by Zesa on Sunday, he said.Zesa Holdings southern region general manager King Dube could not be reached for comment yesterday.In February this year, the city went for more than one week without water following an electric fault, which saw the transformer going up in flames affecting water supply pumps at Gwenoro Dam.Over the years, Gweru s water problems have been worsened by power outages as well as the city s obsolete water pumps and pipes.
