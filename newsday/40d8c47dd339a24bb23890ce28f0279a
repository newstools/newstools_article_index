THE 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22) comes to Africa this year, with the continent eager to hammer out a binding global warming pact. VIEWPOINT by WISDOM MDZUNGAIRISo much is at stake for the African continent, given it is one of the most severely impacted by climate change, with water scarcity and extreme weather conditions such as floods and droughts becoming perennial. In fact, the consequences are too numerous to mention.Yet, most African countries are still to come up with a national climate change policy. Zimbabwe is one of those countries struggling with its implementation, perhaps due to political stagnation and numerous contestations.Zimbabwe is expected to also ratify Paris alongside Africa.This policy should guide those countries eager to adapt and mitigate against the worsening effects of climate change on how to deal with these important issues and save thousands of lives affected by global warming.As it stands, four million people in Zimbabwe are facing starvation due to changing climatic conditions. Hence, a serious administration would embrace any initiative that seeks to reduce the impact of global warming at the worst.It is one thing to have a dedicated government department to deal with climate issues and it is another to turn those well-crafted ideas to mitigate effects of climate into action.Most of Africa has a lot to learn from countries such as the Kingdom of Morocco, which has turned huge tracts of deserts into productive land.Morocco, host of this year s global climate event in the premier resort town of Marrakesh, has somewhat forged a climate change leadership role on the African continent, in particular through the emergences of its world class renewable energy projects.COP 22 president and Moroccan Foreign minister Salaheddine Mezouar said that if it remains business as usual , Africa will only be able to provide 13% of its needs in terms of food by 2050. In the framework of the Paris Agreement, Morocco has committed to reduce by 32% its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.While 195 countries adopted the Paris Agreement last year, it will actually enter into force when about 55 countries, that account for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions, join by approving it domestically and submitting their instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval to the UNFCCC.Some 26 countries representing 39% of total greenhouse gas emissions have since joined the Paris Agreement. It is thought that a further 31 have either committed to join at the Marrakesh climate summit or are extremely likely to, based on national statements and completion of domestic ratification processes.If that happens, as is highly expected, this would bring to 57 countries representing 58% of emissions well over the 55 threshold this year.It is pertinent to state that Africa represents a meagre 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet the continent has until now been receiving only 4% of global climate finance. What an indictment, not only on the part of Western leaders, but Africa as well.Progress was registered by the United States and China s formal support of the Paris Agreement last week, when the two deposited their countries official instruments with United Nations secretary-general Ban-Ki Moon at the G20 summit.The US and China, together, account for about 38% of the world s total greenhouse gas emissions, and their action ended speculation about when the world s two largest greenhouse gas emitters would join the landmark international climate agreement.Clearly, by belatedly joining the Paris Agreement, the US and China turned the page from making commitments to delivering action. It is hoped that this will encourage other world leaders to follow their lead.What is important is that the US-China move brings the world firmly within range of hitting the 55:55 threshold this year perhaps as soon as this October.In joining the Paris Agreement together, the US and China emphasised what can be achieved through co-operation and reconfirmed their responsibility to lead by example.Argentina, Australia, Canada and Mexico, also significant emitters, have all committed to join the Paris Agreement this year, while Brazil appears poised to join soon following the completion of its domestic approval process recently.Given this strong signal sent by the US and China, several countries are expected to also follow through on their pledges.UN secretary-general Ban has scheduled a special event on Wednesday during the UN General Assembly for the remaining countries to join the Paris Agreement by submitting their formal instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval ahead of the Marrakesh climate summit.COP 22 scientific committee chairman Nizar Baraka told African journalists recently that entry by countries meant the Paris Agreement would be in full force and effect under international law, binding those nations and catalysing implementation of their commitments. Baraka added that reaching entry into force rapidly would also demonstrate strong political commitment to the Paris Agreement and increase the pace of putting its operational elements in place.No doubt stabilising the global climate is the greatest challenge of our century. This, because temperatures have exceeded global annual averages for 38 consecutive years, and the impacts, are being felt all around the world!It is, therefore, not in doubt that the water sector in Africa should represent potential solutions to climate change challenges, in addition to being a particularly climate-vulnerable sector.This means Africa should have a common position around water issues ahead of COP 22 and consider ways to put water at the heart of climate negotiations.Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe. Heat waves and drought plague many countries, destroying agriculture, increasing the risk of wildfires and endangering lives. Rising sea level threatens coastal communities and infrastructure by amplifying flooding and storm surge.To indicate the importance of the water sector, climate champions say Africa needs $50 billion to mitigate effects of global warming. Therefore, COP 22 is a clarion call for Africa s time to rise up or sink.Africa s hopes are that the climate agreement will enter into force 30 days after at least 55 parties to the UNFCCC, accounting for at least 55% of global emissions, ratify the agreement this year, post Marrakesh.
