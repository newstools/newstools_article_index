THE 2-1 chastening by Bulawayo giants Highlanders at Barbourfields Stadium on Sunday might have finally extinguished any lingering hopes of seeing Dynamos winning the 2016 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title, let alone competing in the final sprint. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAWith each of the top-flight clubs having to play seven more matches, it s now becoming clear that Dynamos will not be part of what promises to be an intriguing run-in involving FC Platinum, Caps United, Highlanders and probably ZPC Kariba.It s now clear that for the second successive season, there won t be the illuminating blue and white shirt on the winners podium at the end of the season when champions are crowned.Even in the unlikely scenario that they win all their remaining seven matches, it is almost impossible for the Harare giants to come back from this.A massive 12 points separates them from log leaders FC Platinum, on 47 points, with bitter city rivals Caps United in second place on the league table with 46 points, while Highlanders are third with 41 points.ZPC Kariba lie fourth with 36 points.FC Platinum, Caps United and Highlanders all won their respective weekend assignments, which emboldened their title chase, as the league marathon staggers towards the finishing line.While mathematically it is still possible for Dynamos to win the championship, certain facts douse the faint hope.Never mind Highlanders and Caps, but for Dynamos to catch up with FC Platinum, the Zvishavane team would have to lose four of their last seven matches with DeMbare all theirsFootball is a crazy old game, but what are the odds of FC Platinum losing four matches in the last seven matches, having only lost two in 23?If Norman Mapeza s side were to lose four matches and win the other three with Dynamos winning all seven, the two would both end on 56 points, and if they are the top two teams, it would come down to goal difference.At this stage FC Platinum s goal difference is 14, while DeMbare s is just three.DeMbare have had some astonishing comebacks in the past, but this time the task is made the tougher with Caps United and Highlanders also involved in the title sprint and in a much healthier state than Dynamos.Lloyd Mutasa s (pictured) team would need all of the top three to encounter a spectacular collapse where Caps and Highlanders would lose at least three of their last seven matches.And the fixture list does not look favourable to Dynamos where they still have two away matches against the top two teams FC Platinum and Caps United as well as a trip to Triangle, while they still have to host Chicken Inn too.Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe has summed it all up thus: Our chances are as good as those of FC Platinum and Highlanders. I don t know about Dynamos. We have been very consistent. We have never been out of the top three since the season started and that tells you about our ambitions. The Glamour Boys have endured a difficult campaign this term, with their lack of goals being their Achilles heel. It started with their experiment with Portuguese coach, Paulo Jorge Silva, who after initially promising to bring strikers from abroad, went on to sign Evans Gwekwerere, whom he described as the striker I have been looking for , after failing to secure the Brazilians he had promised.Silva s decision to part ways with veteran striker, Takesure Chinyama, who immediately returned Poland, also backfired terribly, with the team struggling in front of goal. The attacking midfielder Masimba Mambare is the team s leading goalscorer speaks volumes of the team s lack of potency.Dynamos, with 18 goals in the league so far, have only outscored relegation favourites Border Strikers (9) and Tsholotsho (17). DeMbare s goals ratio is less than a goal a game.The club s failure in the transfer market, where they lost Ronaldo Chitiyo, while failing to sign Raphael Manuvire and Archford Gutu, might have also haunted the team.Dynamos remaining fixtures Tsholotsho (home), FC Platinum (away), Hwange (home), Caps United (away), Mutare City (home), Triangle (away) and Chicken Inn (home)
