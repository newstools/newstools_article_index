THE much-anticipated WBC title fight between local boxing superstar Charles Manyuchi and Frenchman Damien Martin, which had been set for the Harare International Conference Centre at the end of the month, has been moved to October 14. BY SPORTS CORRESPONDENTOriental Quarry Boxing Promotions, who are handling the bout, told journalists at a Press conference in Harare yesterday about the shift in dates.Manyuchi will defend his WBC Silver title against Martin, the first fight of such a high profile to be staged in the country. The reigning Sportsman of the Year has fought all his continental and world fights either in Zambia, where his promoters and management are based, or Europe.Christopher Malunga, the operations director of Oriental Boxing Promotions, based in Zambia, who handle Manyuchi s affairs, said the pushing of the dates had been necessitated by other engagements that involved their WBC Silver champion, Catherine Phiri.Malunga said they had to travel with Phiri as she fulfilled the ambassadorial role for an international company. A whole week of our initial plans were thus chewed up by this development and we were compelled to push the dates for the Zimbabwe fight by 14 days, said. I will put my head on the block, the fight will happen on this date and there will be no more movement. Malunga said they had set aside a budget of $172 000 and they were anticipating the involvement of the corporate world to make the event a success. According to the schedule unveiled by the manager, Manyuchi, who has been on a break home in Zimbabwe, returns to Lusaka tomorrow to resume camp.He, together with the contingent of other Zambian boxers making up the card, will be in Zimbabwe two weeks before the fight to assist in the marketing of the bill.
