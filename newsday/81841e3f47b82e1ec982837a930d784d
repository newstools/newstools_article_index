HARARE giants Caps United have been dealt a huge blow ahead of their Harare derby against bitter rivals Dynamos at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday, with top marksman, Leonard Tsipa (pictured) and winger, Phineas Bhamusi suspended for accumulating three yellow cards. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKATsipa, the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League leading goal scorer with 11 goals, two ahead of second-placed Gift Mbweti of Hwange, picked up a yellow card in the match against Harare City and two against Border Strikers in May and another on Sunday. Speedy winger, Bhamusi received yellow cards in matches against Chicken Inn, FC Platinum and Border Strikers.Caps United will be desperate for all three points, as they race for the Premiership title with second placed FC Platinum and third-placed Highlanders.The Lloyd Chitembwe-coached side are two points ahead of Norman Mapeza s platinum miners, while Bosso are three points adrift of Caps.Anything less than a win on Sunday for Caps will see the other two teams looking to take advantage.Fifth-placed Dynamos are also aiming for a top-four finish and they would not need extra motivation to produce their best against bitter rivals Caps.Caps would have needed their best talents, but Chitembwe will have to do without some of his most consistently outstanding players of the season.While the Green Machine have options on the wings, it is at the point of the attack that could give Chitembwe a headache, as he prepares his charges for the blockbuster clash that could have a bearing on the destiny of the league title. Without Tsipa s power and influence, Caps United s front line does not possess the same bite, with Dominic Chungwa and Simba Nhivi often failing to rise to the occasion at crucial moments.While Chungwa has emerged as one of the heroes of the recent derby clashes after deciding a fierce contest with the only goal of the match in the reverse fixture against Dynamos, he has not been as reliable as Tsipa, whose experience could have been handy for the Green Machine in Sunday s clash.Caps United will be confident they can still get the result they want even in Tsipa s absence.He has used his experience in driving the Green Machine to mount a serious title challenge and is also chasing the Golden Boot Award. Last season, he scored in the 1-1 draw between Dynamos and Caps.Caps United team manager, Shakespeare Chinogwenya acknowledged that it was a blow losing the two ahead of such an important match for the table toppers. It s disappointing to lose the two players, Tsipa and Bhamusi. They are the kind of players needed in matches like this. They are also players, who have been playing in each and every game, he said.While Bhamusi has been a vital cog in the Green Machine, they know they have good replacements, particularly with the return of Tafadzwa Rusike, who made a second half appearance in the match against Border Strikers on Sunday, where he scored Caps United s third goal.FC Platinum clash with Ngezi Platinum Stars at Mandava Stadium on Saturday, before Highlanders face Bulawayo City at Barbourfields the following day.Fixtures: Saturday: Mutare City v Border Strikers (Sakubva), Chicken Inn v ZPC Kariba (White City), Tsholotsho v Chapungu (Luveve), FC Platinum v Ngezi Platinum (Mandava).
