The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) is seeking bidders to carry water supply and sanitation infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion works in three growth centres under a World Bank-managed fund. BY BUSINESS REPORTERThe World Bank is managing the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (Zimref), which has set aside $20 million for the implementation of a national water project.Zinwa will implement the project through a programme-implementing unit and is in charge of project management.It will oversee the growth centre water and sanitation improvements.The growth centres targeted were Guruve, Gutu, Lupane, Madziwa, Mataga, Nembudziya and Zimunya. In a notice on Sunday, Zinwa said the works were estimated to take 12 months for Guruve and Lupane (18 months) while the rehabilitation in Zimunya would take 12 months. Bidders have up to November 14 to submit their papers.The $20 million water project seeks to improve water resources planning and support reform of the water sector nationally.It is estimated that 52 000 Zimbabweans would benefit from the rehabilitation and expansion of the water systems in these seven small towns. The project would also provide technical assistance for the development of the National Water Resources Master Plan, the commercialisation of Zinwa and the creation of an independent water services regulator, as stipulated by the National Water Policy. The growth centre water and sanitation improvements cost $14,04 million.Investments will include expanding and rehabilitating water treatment works, boreholes, transmission mains, storage and service reservoirs, distribution systems, connections, and meter installation and replacement.The invitation for bids by Zinwa comes as a Zimref mission team was in the country last month to look into how the water project would be implemented.The mission was led by World Bank infrastructure specialist Chloe Oliver Viola and includes other specialists in procurement, water and sanitation, engineering, environment and financial management.Water supply and sanitation services have deteriorated over the last two decades.Zimbabwe s access rates to water and sanitation services have dropped to 46% for water supply and 30% for sanitation.In the past, Zimbabwe was known to have the highest access rates on the continent. The deterioration of water and sanitation services in 2008 led to the outbreak of cholera, which affected 100 000 people and claimed over 4 000 lives.Zimref is a country-specific multi-donor trust fund managed by the World Bank and supports recipient-executed, bank-executed and hybrid projects.This support is under Zimref s four programmatic windows private sector productivity and competitiveness; governance, efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure; strengthening livelihoods and resilience; and analytical and advisory work.Initial donors to Zimref include Denmark, the European Union, Germany, Norway, the State and Peace Building Fund, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.Denmark exited the programme at the end of June.
