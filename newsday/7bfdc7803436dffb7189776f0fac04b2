GOVERNMENT will be gazetting the deregistration of close to 8 million hectares in reserved gold mining areas in all the provinces in a bid to encourage formal participation in the gold mining sector. BY VICTORIA MTOMBASpeaking at the launch of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Mines and Mining Development minister Walter Chidakwa said Cabinet authority had been secured. In order to allow people to go into formal gold mining we are deregistering 7-8 million hectares of land that was reserved for gold mining. We are taking 3 million hectares which we will give to this generation of Zimbabweans. Chidakwa said the argument for the move was basic because when one applies to mine in a reserved area they would not be allowed, but an artisanal miner would start mining without approval.He said to date a total of 20 tonnes of gold has been produced, which was 2 tonnes more than in the previous period last year and the target by year-end is 24 tonnes.Chidakwa said artisanal miners have to be capacitated in a more sustainable way and the School of Mines was in the process of training the miners.He added that there was need for Fidelity Printers to move into gold mining areas collecting the gold from the artisanal miners.Meanwhile, Chidakwa said Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCCL) was set to sell coking coal to a South Africa company under an off-take agreement and was finalising agreements.Chidakwa said government realised that the company was using coking coal to energy security instead of selling it since the coal has high returns and high prices.Chidakwa said the coal miner would be selling off some of its properties and remain with 1 000 units for the workers. We are in the process of sorting out a scheme of arrangement for creditors and by the 10th of October we would have cleaned the balance sheet of Hwange, he said.HCCL is highly indebted and owes workers over $50 million in salary arrears.
