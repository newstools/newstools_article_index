THE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) says some sectors have seen orders going up by 50% after government restricted the importation of certain products to boost local industries. BY MTHANDAZO NYONIIn July, government gazetted Statutory Instrument (SI) 64 of 2016, which removed goods that have local equivalents from the open general import licence, triggering mass protests either side of the Beitbridge border post.Under the new regulations, those who want to import restricted products have to secure a $30 permit, only valid for three months, after justifying why they should be allowed to bring products into the country.In an interview with NewsDay on the sidelines of the Baker s Inn s Buy and Win Promotion launch held in Bulawayo last week, CZI president Busisa Moyo, who was the guest speaker, said SI 64 has had positive impact in the local industry. It s a positive impact. In general for those companies on SI 64, we understand that orders are up 30% to 50% as result of that, Moyo said. So all we encourage is that those companies that are supported under SI 64 must be prioritised in terms of payment because foreign payments can constrain production. So we need assistance in that regard. Moyo, however, said companies were currently busy retooling, increasing production and looking at how they could satisfy local demand. He said the instrument will help companies generate employment for citizens.Meanwhile, Moyo said as CZI they were behind bond notes introduction as the initiative will ease cash shortages. We accept them because they are not compulsory. They come along with the multi-currency system and there is an independent body that will monitor them, he said.He said as industry they were concerned about negative sentiments on bond notes coming from other sector.
