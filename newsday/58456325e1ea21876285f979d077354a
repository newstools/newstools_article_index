A ZAMBIAN satirical play, The Pastor and the Prostitute, left local theatre lovers in stitches when it was staged at Theatre in the Park on Friday by the Bantu Empire theatre outfit. BY LORRAINE MUROMOIt relays the story of a man of the cloth, who, broke his ministerial ethics in the process of assisting a sex worker to turn around her life. At first, the sex worker tries to blackmail him, as she does not want to repent from her ways, but ends up falling in love with the pastor and they get married at the end of the play.Writer and director of the play, Francis Malunga, told NewsDay that, as Zambian artistes, they felt honoured to stage their play in Zimbabwe and were looking forward to bringing more productions. I pray this collaboration between Zimbabwe and Zambia continues and we get to see productions from Zimbabwe coming to Zambia. Cultural exchange is very important, he said. As artistes, we are mouthpieces, we speak for the voiceless, we pass on information that is critical and when people watch, it is easy for them to remember, we teach through arts. There are a lot of issues that we can bring out not only through the form of entertainment, but education as well. Malunga said that there was need for the two countries governments to invest more in theatre and the arts, as a way of enhancing cultural exchanges.He applauded Zimbabweans for their hospitality and said their stay was refreshing and hoped to return with more productions. We felt like we were home and never missed Zambia because everyone was co-operative, Malunga said.He also said if the arts industry was to survive, artistes needed to marry arts with education.
