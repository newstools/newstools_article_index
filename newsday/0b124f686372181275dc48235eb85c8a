A CIVIL engineer with the Ministry of Local Government has organised a meeting with Bubi villagers with a view to converting an old farmhouse at Molo Farm into a clinic. BY SILAS NKALAThe development comes as villagers have complained of walking long distances of between 20 and 50km to the nearest clinics in Makoni and Majiji.Bubi s ward 18 MDC-T councillor, Andrew Nduna Matshazi said the meeting will be held on September 19. We were supposed to meet the engineer at the site tomorrow (today), where villagers are expecting to be advised as to what is needed for the farmhouse to be turned into a clinic. He is expected to advise the villagers whether the structure should be extended or refurbished and what else is needed for the farmhouse to suit the clinic standards, he said.Matshazi recently said the Bubi Rural District Council had approved plans for the construction of clinics at Molo and Mbembeswana 2 areas.The councillor said the shortage of clinics forced some patients to travel about 49km to St Lukes Hospital in Lupane.
