HIGHLY sought-after music producer Oskid is set to celebrate his birthday in style with a braai party at Sally Mugabe Heights, in a fundraiser for his nationwide Oskid Talent Show tour themed The Breakaway Star, which starts today. BY LORRAINE MUROMOThe fundraiser, targeted to raise an estimated $34 000, will be graced by Creator Fire, Nadine Brown, Dobba Don, Nutty O and Jah Signal, among others. Tour spokesperson Shepherd Tsandukwa told NewsDay that the tour would cover all the country s provinces to unearth and nurture hidden talent. We have realised that Zimbabwe has talent, but doesn t have resources, especially for upcoming stars. That s why we are taking this stance. We want to bring someone with a dream up and we are determined to find them where they are, he said. The auditions are going to cater for 100 participants in every province and only 10 will make it to the top in every province. Through the selection process, one qualifier from each province will make it to the final 10 in Harare, where only three of them will receive free full package contracts of recording an album and a video by Oskid. Tsandukwa said the selection process included the payment of a $10 registration fee before auditions began and that the only talent they were were in search of was singing. The criteria we will use for the show will be easy, considering that an individual only has to pay a registration fee of $10. With regards to talent, we are looking at the art of singing zimdancehall and hip-hop, he said.
