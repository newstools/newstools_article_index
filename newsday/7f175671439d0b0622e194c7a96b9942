ZAPU leader Dumiso Dabengwa has said removing President Robert Mugabe and Zanu PF alone is not enough, saying Zimbabweans must also weed the country of the evil system that has sustained the governing party since 1980 to guarantee economic turnaround. BY NQOBANI NDLOVUZAPU leader Dumiso DabengwaAddressing party supporters at Gadadi business centre in Umzingwane district, Matabeleland South province, Dabengwa on Saturday said Mugabe and Zanu PF s bad governance lies at the root of the country s socio-economic problems .He, however, warned that pushing out Mugabe was not the end game, adding the 92-year-old veteran politician had created a system which could remain a stumbling block to economic recovery after he was gone. Mugabe must go is a starting point for a democratic agenda because he personifies all that is wrong with the all-pervasive dictatorial machine. However, taking the first step is not the same thing as arriving at a destination, Dabengwa said. We must get rid of Mugabe from power, but it is equally important to get rid of the system that has sustained him in power for so long and with so many negative consequences of the gravy train. He has perfected a system that has allowed the country to be bled through run-away corruption. He said Zapu was also against the introduction of bond notes which government plans to introduce purportedly to ease the liquidity crisis, describing the move as mischievous . We are strongly opposed to the introduction of worthless paper money that will amount to the mopping up of hard-earned foreign currency. The move is mischievous because we know that in the absence of investor-friendly policies, there will be no capacity to pay our way internationally and get back to productivity, the Zapu leader said.Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor John Mangudya recently declared that there was no going back on bond notes, saying the first batch should start circulating on the market end of next month, despite public fears that the notes were a replica of the long-discarded Zimbabwe dollar.
