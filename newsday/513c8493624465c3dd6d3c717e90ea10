PLAYWRIGHT Getrude Vimbayi Munhamo yesterday urged government to urgently consider the abolishment of the death penalty as it was an archaic mode of punishment in modern civilisations. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOMunhamo told NewsDay ahead of a concert to commemorate the World Day Against the Death Penalty through art set for October 10 at Theatre in the Park.The concert will feature an array of local artists across genres with Munhamo s play, The Dead Are Alive, also to be staged during the concert. Munhamo said she was inspired to write the play to add her voice against the death sentence. While some developed countries have banned this kind of penalty, it is still in use in many other countries around the world, which we are saying must come to an end, she said.Munhamo said the The Dead Are Alive juxtaposes and explores cultural and traditional justice systems against the backdrop of modern methods. The story revolves around the character of Taizivei Murambadoro who is sentenced to death for robbery and murder although he was not present when his colleagues committed the crimes.Munhamo said she was happy that artists have joined hands to advocate for the abolishment of the death sentence.She expressed gratitude to Daves Guzha for allowing the play to be staged at Theatre in the Park.Tehn Diamond, Chirikure Chirikure, Everson Ndhlovu, Stewart Sakarombe and DJ Naida are expected to perform.Choreographer Lionel Tendai Guzha described the death penalty as an unfair law.
