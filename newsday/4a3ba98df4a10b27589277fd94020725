The African Development Fund (ADF) board has approved four agriculture and forestry sector risk participations amounting to $62 million to cover investments in 16 countries, including Zimbabwe. by staff reporterADF is a concessional arm of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB).The risk participations will come under ADF s private sector enhancement facility (PSF).Risk participation is a type of off-balance-sheet transaction in which a bank sells its exposure to a contingent obligation, such as a banker s acceptance to another financial institution.Risk participation allows banks to reduce their exposure to delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and company failures.In a statement on Friday, AfDB said the four transactions were risk participations in private sector projects of the bank group, covering investment programmes in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C te d Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The PSF was launched in 2015 to provide risk sharing and increase private sector financing in low income countries.The PSF is supported by a $230 million grant from the ADF to cover potential losses on payment defaults up to $690m, AfDB said. With these approved risk participations, the cumulative amount of exposures approved since commencing operations has reached $345m [51% of total programme amount], AfDB said. These new transactions bring to 23 the number of approved projects under the PSF scheme, which covers a cross section of sectors including independent power producers [including renewable energy projects], toll roads, container terminals, cement plants, agro-industries, and financial institutions.
