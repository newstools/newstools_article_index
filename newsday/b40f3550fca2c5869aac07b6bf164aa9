An independent power producer (IPP) has applied to the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) to construct a 2,5 MW solar photovoltaic power station. BY BUSINESS REPORTER In a statement yesterday, Zera said the proposed plant would be located at Musvaire in Mutoko, Mashonaland East. Notice is hereby given that Zera has received an application from Riverside Power Station to construct, own, operate and maintain a 2,5 MW solar photovoltaic power station for the purpose of generating and supply of electricity in Zimbabwe, Zera said.Zera said the project would also include the construction of 3,4 kilometres of a 33kv line from the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) Mutoko substation to the proposed Riverside power station site.According to Section 40 of the Electricity Act (Chapter 13:19) anyone operating an electricity undertaking which generates, transmits, distributes or supplies electricity should be licenced by Zera.According to the Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management study commissioned by Zera, the country could save 250 MW by implementing energy efficiency measures in key sectors of the economy.Zera and the ZETDC have registered an increasing interest from IPPs to invest in solar power. The country is currently struggling to meet its energy requirements due to limited investment in the capital-intensive sector. Power generation currently stands at 1 475 MW against a peak demand of 2 200MW as new power generation projects take time to complete.
