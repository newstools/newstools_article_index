OPPOSITION legislators yesterday took advantage of the official opening of the Fourth Session of the Eighth Parliament to complain about death threats they received on their mobile phones from an anonymous number. BY VENERANDA LANGAVice President Emmerson MnangagwaAs soon as the Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda announced that President Robert Mugabe would officially open the new session of Parliament at midday, Kuwadzana East legislator Nelson Chamisa (MDC-T) stood up to raise the issue of harassment of opposition lawmakers each time Mugabe addressed Parliament. This is a serious issue because we are MPs by virtue of having been elected by people and by the Constitution, and the President cannot be President without us MPs, and this is a breach of the Constitution, he said.Chamisa read one of the messages from an anonymous number, which said he was a young MP and, therefore, had no reason to die early because his family needed him. Zanu PF MPs shouted that the message was sent by his mistress.Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa said the death threats were of great concern to all MPs. Whoever is responsible for such messages threatening lives or the security of MPs or even any citizen, this cannot be taken lightly, he said.The VP, however, chided Chamisa for raising points of order when business of the House was suspended to allow the President to deliver his speech.Mudenda then made a ruling, saying Chamisa had raised a serious matter. We shall refer the matter to the Standing Rules and Orders Committee so that they set up a privileges committee that will go into details of this. Those affected must submit their complaints and the investigation process will then take place, he said.Meanwhile, as Mugabe was receiving his speech ahead of the official opening of Parliament, Mkoba MP Amos Chibaya (MDC-T) exclaimed loudly that the 92-year-old leader should double-check it to avoid reading a wrong speech again. You must double-check President, these are conmen, he shouted, drawing laughter from the opposition benches.Last year, Mugabe mistakenly read the State of the Nation Address at the official opening of Parliament.In his speech, Mugabe outlined a very busy legislative agenda, with 33 laws that will be brought for crafting either as amendments to already existing laws or as new laws.Among the new laws to be crafted are the Computer Crime and Cyber Security Bill, Data Protection Bill to curb misuse of online applications, Public Entities Corporate Governance Bill to foster good corporate governance, Coroner s Office Bill to pave way for the setting-up of the Coroner s Office responsible for medico-legal investigations, and amendments to indigenisation laws to be in tandem with the indigenisation policy. Several laws will be drafted, while a new Labour Amendment Bill will be crafted as well as a Health Bill and another Bill to regulate medical aid societies.
