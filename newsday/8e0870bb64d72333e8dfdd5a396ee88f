Suspended Prosecutor-General (PG) Johannes Tomana, who is facing charges of criminal abuse of office, is now set to be tried at the High Court after the State yesterday indicated it was preparing to furnish him with his trial date on October 17, the court heard. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDETomana&#8217;s trial was supposed to kick off on August 29 this year, but was postponed to October 4 after the State notified the court that it had not furnished the defence with relevant court papers in time for Tomana to prepare his defence.However, Tomana s reporting conditions were scrapped after his lawyer, Tazorora Musarurwa, made an application before magistrate Vakai Chikwekwe.Allegations against Tomana stem from 2004, when the then chief executive of the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (Zupco), Bright Matonga, was charged with culpable homicide arising from an accident which claimed the life of a pedestrian, Chipo Chikowore. It is alleged Tomana ordered the State to withdraw the charges against Matonga.The State also alleges sometime in 2006, Matonga was again charged with contravening sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and in December 2008 Tomana allegedly ordered prosecutor Morgan Dube to drop charges against Matonga after plea.In another matter in 2006, former Zupco board chairman Charles Nherera was convicted of corruption and sentenced to three years imprisonment and in that case Tomana was the defence witness.After Tomana was appointed PG, he allegedly declared Nherera was innocent and wrongfully convicted and thereafter facilitated his release.Former Bindura Hospital acting medical superintendent Beauty Basile was charged with criminal abuse of office, but Tomana ordered the withdrawal of the charges after plea in November 2009.Again sometime in October 2009, gold dealer Patrick Mavros was charged for gold possession without a licence, but Tomana directed that prosecution be declined despite Mavros having admitted to the charge.Jonathan Chingwinyiso appeared for the State.
