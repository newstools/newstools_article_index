SOCIAL movements leaders yesterday gave law enforcers up to Monday to take action against Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo, failure of which they have threatened to effect a citizen s arrest for allegedly abusing over $400 000 from the Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund (Zimdef). BY OBEY MANAYITIPresident Robert Mugabe last week reportedly blocked the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) from arresting Moyo over the allegations.Moyo has since denounced Zacc s investigation, accusing the anti-graft body of pursuing a Zanu PF factional agenda. However, Tajamuka spokesperson, Promise Mkwananzi said if nothing was done against Moyo by Monday, they would take the law into their own hands. We have waited for the law to take its course on Moyo, who has admitted to abusing public funds. If there is no arrest by Monday, then we are going to effect a citizen s arrest on him and surrender him to the nearest police station, he said. On that note, we also want to warn Vice-President Phekezela Mphoko that he should not try to interfere with the law. This is the second time this year alone, after he released two suspects from Avondale Police Station. If he continues with that behaviour, he will only have himself to blame. Another activist, Patson Dzamara, of the Occupy Africa Unity Square movement, said Zanu PF and government officials were exhibiting retrogressive behaviour, which called for action by citizens. He (Moyo) is part an arrogant and thieving elite, who views the national purse as his private property. Moyo s conduct summarises the failure, corruption, dishonesty and mendacity, which has been the hallmark of Zanu PF s rule over the last 36 years, he said. It, however, gives credence to the fact that Zanu PF and Mugabe must go because they have failed absolutely.
