ACTING President President Phelekezela Mphoko has said the government is working to address the issue of birth certificates for the children of Gukurahundi victims, as the emotive subject returns to the headlines. Agencies/Staff ReporterAddressing mourners at the funeral of former Speaker of Parliament, Cyril Ndebele, in Bulawayo on Monday, Mphoko said the government would also look to facilitate the reburial of those killed in the 1980s conflict.Mphoko, who is also in charge of the national healing and reconciliation portfolio in Cabinet, said the government was committed to bringing closure to the Gukurahundi issue and also ensuring the reburial of victims of the conflict. The government is working on modalities of healing the wounds of the disturbances experienced in Matabeleland and parts of the Midlands provinces in the 1980s by ensuring that all victims are identified and given decent burial, he said. The late Ndebele was working on how to introduce the programme, which is expected to heal victims of the disturbances. Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo recently rekindled the Gukurahundi debate, when his family wrote to the Tsholotsho district administrator, Gloria Raundi, requesting for permission to exhume the remains of his father, Melusi Job Mlevu, a victim of the Gukurahundi massacres, and accord him a decent burial at the family shrine.Mlevu, who worked as a PF-Zapu councillor, was reportedly abducted by the Fifth Brigade in 1982 and ordered to dig his own grave before he was murdered and shoved into a shallow grave.He became one of the earliest victims of one of the darkest chapters in Zimbabwe s history. Rights groups say the conflict left 20 000 civilians dead, mostly villagers in Midlands and Matabeleland regions, as the government unleashed an army unit to crack down on perceived ex-Zipra dissidents.President Robert Mugabe has described the mass killings as a moment of madness , but has declined to publicly apologise for the atrocities despite pressure from human rights groups and opposition parties.
