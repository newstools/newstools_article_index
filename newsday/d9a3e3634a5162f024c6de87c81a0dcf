By Munyaradzi MadzokereThe Sunshine City Boys, who have struggled for consistency in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League race this season, will be looking to be at their best in the country s most prestigious cup competition which guarantees participation in the Caf Confederation Cup. We are the defending champions of the Chibuku Super Cup and we want to successfully defend this title. We know very well that it s not going to easy, but my team is ready, he said.Chunga described cup competitions as unpredictable, hence, they were not taking Border Strikers lightly. We are not taking our opponents lightly and we can t say it s an easy game as long as we have not yet played them. Remember Caps United lost to a boozers team, Highdon Raiders, some years ago and we could lose too if we are not careful, Chunga said.The City Fathers beat Harare giants Dynamos 2-1 to lift the Chibuku Super Cup title last year. Border Strikers, whose prospects of surviving relegation this season seem to be dwindling with each passing week, will be hoping to leave a mark in their first cup competition in the top-flight league.They also have a new coach in Luke Masomere, who will be looking to make an immediate impression in his first match in charge.
