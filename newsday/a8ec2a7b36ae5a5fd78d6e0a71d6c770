NORTON residents were on Sunday treated to uplifting music from the brother and sister duo of Forward and Gladmore Mazuruse, who performed alongside Reginald Denhe from Mt Darwin, as well as the Remnants from Madziwa. BY ARTS REPORTERForward Mazuruse performs at the Norton Super SundayThe musicians were performing at Bright Light Prophetic Ministries crusade held in Norton by church founder, Brighton Chikomo.Chikomo said music had a special place in the house of God and he had a passion to work with musicians as he did his ministerial work. I am a firm believer in worship and I appreciate the fact that when praises go up, the glory of God comes down, he said. True to that assertion, we had a powerful service where many were delivered from bondage and afflicting spirits coupled with accurate prophecy from God. Mazuruse, whose song Muneni, was a crowd favourite, said it was refreshing taking time out of the busy studio schedule to minister hope through inspired music. Music to me is ministry and it feels good taking a break from the studio sessions with various artistes to come and minister hope to the nation, he said. Mazuruse alternated well on stage with his sister Gladmore, whose debut album, Rumbidzwai, will be released in the next few weeks.
