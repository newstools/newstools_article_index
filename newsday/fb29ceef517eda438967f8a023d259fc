VICE-PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has urged journalists to do their work without fear, favour or apology, because their work is protected by the Constitution and is a fundamental pillar in the development of Zimbabwe. BY BLESSED MHLANGA The media industry has a key role to play to inform and educate the citizenry and the expectation is that you fulfil that role without fear, favour or apology, he said while addressing the National Journalism and Media Awards dinner in Harare on Thursday.He, however, called on the media to exercise their rights responsibly to ensure that they do not incite violence, hatred and breach rights to privacy as indicated in the Constitution. The rights accorded to your industry by the Constitution should always be esteemed, never abused and exercised responsibly but I did not say do not speak out against those who advocate for violence and hatred, they should be exposed, but the media should not propagate hatred, he said.Mnangagwa gave the media a pat on the back for exposing corruption. Corruption must never be rewarded with impunity, while righteousness is punished with hostile editorials, he said in apparent reference to Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo and his deputy, Godfrey Gandawa, who are facing allegations of siphoning over $400 000 from the Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund. We all have a responsibility of fighting corruption in all sectors of our society in whatever form or fashion it presents itself and on the platform I agree with you totally we are sailing in the same boat.
