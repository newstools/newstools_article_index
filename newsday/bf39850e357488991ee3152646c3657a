TAJAMUKA spokesperson Promise Dalubuhle Mkwananzi finally tasted freedom yesterday almost three weeks after he was remanded in custody over allegations of public violence that rocked Harare s central business district (CBD) on August 24. BY CHARLES LAITON Mkwananzi (35), who is also the Zimbabwe Informal Sector Organisation s director, is accused of being part of marchers that allegedly set alight police and Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation vehicles during running battles between police and protesters. High Court judge Justice Happius Zhou granted Mkwananzi $100 bail and ordered him to surrender his passport, report once every week at CID Law and Order and not to interfere with witnesses. Although the State was opposed to Mkwananzi s release, Justice Zhou said the State s averment that he assaulted law enforcers on its own would not amount to interfering with State witnesses. The judge said the State s fears could easily be allayed by the imposition of a bail condition barring Mkwananzi from interfering with State witnesses, a possibility which was highly unlikely in the current matter. Mkwananzi s release comes barely a week after four of the several MDC-T activists who were arrested last month on the same charges were also freed on $100 bail each by High Court judge Justice Joseph Musakwa. Kerina Gweshe (62), Arthur Chiguvari (35), Loveness Mahlepu (42) and Tonderai Chakaredza (44) were arrested on August 24 on allegations that they participated in the demonstrations staged in the CBD while acting in common purpose with others who have already appeared in court and others still at large. The State alleges the suspects teamed up at Harvest House, the MDC-T headquarters, along Nelson Mandela Avenue and held a public meeting where they conspired to proceed to the CBD and cause sporadic violence, setting ablaze State-owned properties which included the two motor vehicles. It also alleged they went around the CBD destroying private property and pelted two private vehicles with stones, but Justice Musakwa asked the State if gathering at Harvest House would constitute an offence, to which the State answered it did not.
