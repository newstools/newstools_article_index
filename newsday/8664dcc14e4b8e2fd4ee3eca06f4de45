The song made waves both locally and internationally.Born to Enita Charewa Chamboko, Mare attended St Dominics and Hermain Gmeiner schools.She attributed her success in music to hard work and determination, without which, she said, she would not have reached such heights in her music career.She said she grew up in an RnB culture in the UK and consequently adopted that genre when she fell in love with music. Her new sound, she said, reflected her origins and experiences.The new Afro-fusion genre carried the strains of jazz, gospel and traditional Zimbabwean mbira.However, the death of her mother four years ago became the turning point in her life, which made her look back to her roots and spurred her to establish her own distinct sound.
