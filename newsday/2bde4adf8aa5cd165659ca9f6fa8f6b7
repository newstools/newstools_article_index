BY KENNETH NYANGANI The prestigious annual event is, as has been the norm, set to attract the country s top athletes.Veteran administrator Tagara said preparations for the race were at an advanced stage before applauding the race s sponsor for the continued support. As usual, we are expecting tough competition. We expect to have an interesting battle between Constance Nyasango and Rutendo Nyahora, who have been swapping positions on the podium in the last few races, Tagara said. I am also happy that athletes who participated at the Rio Olympics in Brazil have now recovered, so we are going to witness a tough race indeed. I want to take this opportunity to thank Old Mutual because they have remained committed in supporting athletics in the country. They are also the sponsors of two races in Mutare, two in Harare and one in Bulawayo, so they are doing a wonderful job to improve the sport of athletics in the country. Big-name athletes who are expected to grace this year s event are Olympians Wirimayi Juwawo, Nyasango and Nyahora, among others.Manicaland Athletics Association chairman Joshua Matume said he was happy with the preparations.
