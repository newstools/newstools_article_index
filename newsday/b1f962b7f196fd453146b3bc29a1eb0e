VICTORIA Falls Municipality management has written to the government pleading ignorance of the law after an audit unearthed corrupt land dealings, where the local authority was selling residential stands to councillors for as low as 25% of their value, in violation of government policy. NewZimbabwe.comA circular from government in 2011 directed local authorities to allocate residential stands to councillors for between 30% and 40% depending on period of service.However, a recent audit of the local authority by the government revealed that councillors bought stands for as low as 25%, in violation of the policy.According to the latest council minutes, councillors and management claim they were not aware of the circular, despite it being dispatched five years ago.Council sources said management and councillors were in panic mode, fearing Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere (pictured) might descend on the resort town.The local authority has since written to Kasukuwere seeking to be pardoned on the basis that they were not aware of the directive. This comes in the wake of suspension of Bulawayo deputy mayor Gift Banda and four other councillors on allegations of corruptly acquiring land, a rot also unearthed by an audit.The city fathers, who claim that they were not at first aware of the circular dated April 28, 2011 and addressed to all provincial administrators, town clerks, local board secretaries and chief executives , said they only got to know about it when it was shown to them by the auditors. They said they panicked after learning that Those local authorities who had already granted councillors concessionary rates on purchase of residential stands prior to issuance of this circular should now rationalise the discounts so that they fall within this structure .Speaking at a full council meeting, town clerk, Christopher Dube said the municipality was not aware of the circular and has appealed for condonation. We weren t aware of the circular until the auditors revealed it, that s we are bringing the matter to you, he said. Council already had a resolution to allocate councillors land at a 25% concessionary price and we have been using that resolution over the year. Councillors are agreeing to this and we have taken the matter to the permanent secretary (George Mlilo) of which we await a way forward, as we seek leniency and condonation. The full council meeting resolved that reversing the allocations would lead to administrative problems as some councillors could have sold the stands or were dead or no longer in council.According to the circular, councillors serving their first term in office should buy residential stands at 40%, while those who have been in council for two terms should part with 35% for stands.Those who have more than two terms should buy at 30%.The discounts, meant to cushion councillors, most of whom are not gainfully employed, are only applicable to residential stands, while councillors should pay full amounts for commercial and industrial stands. Councillors, including mayors and chairpersons, shall access residential stands in the same local authority at 40% of the cost price, for those serving their first term, 35% for those in second term and 30% for those on a third term and above, reads part of the circular.This is irrespective of whether one owned such property prior to assuming office, but should not have benefitted prior to circulation of the notice and the stands should be in their respective wards. The discounts do not apply to commercial and industrial stands, meaning to say a majority of councillors who un-procedurally acquired such from 2009 to the present day on concessionary rates should either return or pay the difference, as they are hitherto reversed.
