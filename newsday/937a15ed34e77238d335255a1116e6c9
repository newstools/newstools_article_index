The fiscal statement fiasco in which policy proposals to Parliament by Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa were reversed a few days later by his Cabinet colleague, Information minister Chris Mushohwe, demonstrates that President Robert Mugabe s Cabinet may be the most dysfunctional and discordant the world has ever seen. By Justice Takesure,Our ReaderPresident R.G.MugabeEvidence on the economic landscape over the years suggests the Mugabe administration has spectacularly failed to deliver economic growth. His is a Cabinet that wages war on itself. The stories about there being enemies and detractors aren t true. The circus should, of course, not be allowed to continue. It is high time Zanu PF purged the malaise from within or without.Former Finance minister Tendai Biti alleges Mugabe deliberately betrayed and humiliated Chinamasa. If this is half true even, diehard Zanu PF parliamentarians should agree Mugabe needs a new mandate as soon as possible that only a Presidential election can bring. And that is, at the very least, an impeachment with bipartisan backing not being out of order. If Biti s allegations are true, it is time to resign en masse from Cabinet and government or risk being fired that now a strong case has been made, just before bond notes are used to pay on time the 2016 civil service bonuses, as may have been long planned.
