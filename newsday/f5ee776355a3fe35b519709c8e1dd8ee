HIGHLANDERS coach, Erol Akbay believes that any team that makes a mistake in the remaining four rounds of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League campaign will be thrown out of the race. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAOnly three points separate the top three teams Caps United, FC Platinum and Highlanders, as the race reaches its climax, with four matches to go for each team.FC Platinum and Highlanders still have to play each other. The platinum miners stumbled at the weekend, suffering a 2-1 defeat to Harare City with both Caps and Highlanders taking advantage with wins.But for Akbay, there is no more room for error and any team that stumbles will not be able to recover. It s a tight race a three-horse race. Everyone wants to win all their remaining four matches. Any team that makes a mistake will be out of the race. You can t afford to make a mistake, he said.The Dutchman is banking on Caps United dropping points in their remaining matches against Dynamos, Harare City, Ngezi Platinum and Chapungu. I think our match against FC Platinum could decide the championship depending on what Caps United will be doing. If they stumble, our match against FC Platinum could be a title decider, I think. But if they keep winning, it could be of no influence. Everyone has a chance and we will try to avoid mistakes. Bosso, who have won their last six matches, still have to play Bulawayo City, Tsholotsho, FC Platinum and Hwange. FC Platinum still have to play Ngezi Platinum at Mandava Stadium before making the trip to Ascot for a date with Chapungu. They will then host Highlanders before rounding off the campaign with an away tie to Tsholotsho.Caps United seemingly have the tougher run of fixtures, with two Harare derbies, while Ngezi Platinum are a potential banana skin before the trip to Ascot Stadium to face Chapungu.
