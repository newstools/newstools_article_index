A South Africa-based Zimbabwean businesswoman has sued the Zimbabwe Republic Police demanding the immediate release of her car, which was impounded at Beitbridge Border Post over smuggling allegations. BY SILAS NKALAKhethiwe Nyathi claims the seizure of her Toyota Fortuner was illegal and filed an urgent chamber application at the Bulawayo High Court on September 30, citing the officer-in-charge Border Controls and Minerals Unit Beitbridge, the officer commanding Matabeleland South District and Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri, as respondents. The applicant (Nyathi) was arrested and arraigned at Beitbridge Magistrates Court, where on the first count, which is conspiracy to smuggle the State withdrew the charges against her. On the second count defeating or obstructing the course of justice, she was ordered to pay a $400 fine, which she duly paid, Nyathi said in her affidavit. The applicant obtained an ex-parte order for the release of her motor vehicle, which order respondents to date, refuse to comply with. She said she had already been subjected to all legal processes and had no pending criminal trial, adding her vehicle was still held at the Beitbridge Border Post for no apparent reason. Applicant is losing out in terms of revenue and incurred levies and expenses due to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, as the temporary import permit under which the vehicle was brought into the country has since expired, Nyathi said. The vehicle is under a South African insurance policy. That insurance is also issued subject to certain terms and conditions, one of them is that it cannot be outside the jurisdiction of South Africa for more than a certain period of time. The insurers are now demanding to see the vehicle and the applicant cannot produce it. She said she had brought the vehicle into the country mainly for use to travel between Zimbabwe and South Africa, while conducting her contract mining business.
