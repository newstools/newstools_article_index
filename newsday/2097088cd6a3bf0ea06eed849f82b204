THE Zimbabwe Sugar Milling Industry Workers Union (ZSMIWU) executive has suspended its president Freedom Madungwe on allegations of misconduct. BY PAIDAMOYO MUZULUZSMIWU said they would meet with their members tomorrow to brief them on Madungwe s misconduct.Madungwe was suspended on Tuesday after a full executive meeting accused him of abusing funds and clandestinely conniving with the employer to fire other union members.ZSMIWU secretary-general Captain Gono confirmed Madungwe s suspension yesterday. The national executive committee of the union established that Madungwe was involved in activities that are inconsistent with the objectives of the union on the provisions of ZSMIWU constitution and resolved to suspend him pending a hearing, Gono said in a statement. Among the charges is that Madungwe wrote to the human resources director asking for a vehicle to attend a political demonstration when it s clear the union is apolitical. On September 8 he collected $380 from the NEC saying it was for the executive, but the money was never given to the members concerned and, lastly, he connived with company lawyers to have some union members fired over an industrial action that took place. However, NewsDay understands that Madungwe has defied the suspension, and instead reportedly suspended other members of the executive members, prompting tomorrow s meetings.Gono said the meeting with workers would take place at Triangle starting 10am and then move over to Chishamiso at 2pm.Efforts to get a comment from Madungwe were unsuccessful.
