ZIMBABWE has engaged its Sadc counterparts to lobby for a regional position on the continued ivory trade ban which the country wants lifted ahead of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meeting to be held in South Africa next week. by PAIDAMOYO MUZULUThe European Union and North America are pushing for the continued ban on trade in ivory to curb poaching of elephants and rhinoceros.But Environment, Water and Climate minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri told NewsDay yesterday that the Sadc region had to come up with a regional resolution as it carries the burden of wildlife overpopulation due to its good conservation methods. As Sadc ministers, we feel we are being punished by not being able to sell our ivory. We have to take a position as a region in order to save ourselves, she said.Muchinguri-Kashiri said the region should be allowed to trade in ivory for the benefit of its communities. The animals are causing havoc on our environment, particularly now with adverse climate change challenges. If we are not allowed to sell, then it s unfortunate because our people will not be able to see the value of conserving these animals, she said.Muchinguri-Kashiri said the EU had made it difficult by imposing restrictive conditions to trade in ivory. The EU is supporting trade in ivory, but it has put a condition that the receiving country has also to give permission before the consignment can be shipped, she said.Zimbabwe has, since last year, been exporting some baby elephants to China as a means of managing its elephant population.Muchinguri-Kashiri said government was working on exporting 500 young elephants that could still adapt to new environments.CITES which has 181 member countries remains one of the world s most powerful tools for biodiversity conservation through the regulation of trade in wild fauna and flora. Thousands of species are internationally traded and used by people in their daily lives for food, housing, health care, ecotourism, cosmetics or fashion.
