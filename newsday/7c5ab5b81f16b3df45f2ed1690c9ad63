Our main focus is to build a side for the Olympic qualifiers in three years time and that s why we have tried to come up with a good balance between the experienced core players and the youngsters from the successful Under-18 squad, Kawonza said.Eight African nations will battle it out for the continental crown in the two-day tournament where a slot in next year s World Rugby Women Sevens Series qualifiers will be at stake for the winners.Botswana and Zambia, the bottom two sides in last year s competition, are excluded from this year s tournament after Rugby Africa made it an eight-team tournament, down from the 10 that competed last year.South Africa won the 2015 edition of the Rugby Africa Women s Sevens that doubled as Olympics qualifiers by beating Kenya 31-7 in Johannesburg, while Zimbabwe settled for fourth position after a 33-0 defeat to Tunisia in the 3rd/4th place playoff match.Zimbabwe Squad for Rugby Africa Women s Sevens: Charity Muchuchuti (captain), Precious Marange, Peace Sithole, Carol Malenga, Rumbi Chigumba, Constance Ngwende, Sicelumusa Nyoni, Ruvimbo Musere, Margret Magwaro, Hilda Marange, Simbisai Kadye, Delight Mukomondo.
