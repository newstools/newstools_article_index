SowetanIn a teaser shared by Anele on Instagram Kelly revealed that the elaborate investigation of Senzo s murder is driving her crazy as she has been barred from speaking out about the events leading up to his death on October 26, 2014. The investigation thing is driving me crazy because people want to know. And I want to get this out of my system and move on with my life she explained in the short clip. At the end of the day I m not the killer here. At the end of the day I m one person that wants the country to know what happened. At the end of the day Senzo was not only loved by me. He was loved by his family. He was loved by the country. And for me I feel like the police are not doing enough. I m actually mad. In another clip Kelly divulged details about the love she shared with Senzo claiming that he loved her even in his grave . I ve always been at peace where Senzo is concerned how he felt about me. You can t take that away from me. That is the beauty of it that you can scream you can accuse you can call me names but one thing that you can never take away from me, is the fact that that man loved me. Even in his grave.
