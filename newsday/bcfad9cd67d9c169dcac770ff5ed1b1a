I was shocked when I heard that President Mugabe was calling for other African leaders to join him in castigating the United Nations for not implementing reforms to the Security Council and urging the African region to pull out of the world body. By Ba Kiki,Our ReaderHaving been following events of civil unrest taking place in our own country, where citizens are demanding a better living from your government, Mr President, where some opposition parties are taking to the streets to show their anger over your misrule, and where you have responded so viciously by unleashing your heavily partisan police force on them so that they will not voice their grievances on the streets, it s so amazing to hear you can also feel the pain of being deprived of your rights. If you were practising good leadership in your own home, Mr President, the UN would have agreed long back to implement reforms.Yes, Sir, if I may ask, whose interests are you serving in this matter? How much have the Russians or Chinese paid you to threaten to pull out of the UN? Please don t be selfish by holding the whole continent to ransom at the expense of advancing the interests of your masters.In your case, Mr President, your pulling-out will bring a lot of suffering to the majority of the people. Think of the torrid time you will also get from your flamboyant wife, who seems to be the organiser of all your foreign trips. Please, Sir, we long wish to see you getting more embarrassments from such people around you. Just think well before you continue to make us Zimbabweans suffer from such ill-informed decisions.
