The Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ) says a $50 million bond to finance two projects by the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) has been fully subscribed, demonstrating the market s confidence in its instruments. BY BUSINESS REPORTERIn 2014, IDBZ went to the market to raise the money, which would be used by ZPC to finance the refurbishment of Kariba South Power Station ($38,8m) and the repowering of the Harare Thermal Power Station ($11,2m).In a notice on Sunday, IDBZ said: We are pleased to advise the market that the bond has since been fully subscribed. The IDBZ is grateful for the continued support the bank receives from the investor community in its resource mobilisation initiatives, as this demonstrates the market s confidence in the bank s instruments. Refurbishment at Kariba South will guarantee existing plant capacity of 750 megawatts (MW), while the repowering of the Harare Thermal Station will increase generation capacity by 30MW. In its annual report, IDBZ said $30,7m had been raised last year to finance the two projects, adding that the bond was available for subscription under the private placement.IDBZ said its intervention was expected to optimise output from the two existing power stations, which would help increase the country s energy output and reduce the power supply gap.The development bank said it was in the process of packaging a number of housing projects and should be approaching the market in the fourth quarter of this year with the second tranche of its housing bond to raise between $10m and $15m.The resources would be used to fund the implementation of the housing projects that would have reached bankability, the bank said. Through the issuance of innovative and appropriately packaged instruments, the bank contributes towards the development of a robust capital market, while facilitating the implementation of critical infrastructure projects, it said.For the half-year ended June 30, 2016, the bank posted a profit of $170 000, compared to a $1,84m loss posted in the same period last year.This has been attributed to stable long-term loans funded by bonds.Total income was $2,96m from $3,94m in 2015 due to public sector investment programme funding, the bank said.
