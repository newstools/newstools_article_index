Child rights lobby groups have criticised government for underfunding the Junior Parliament s activities, saying this negatively affected their participation in governance issues. BY REJOICE CHINGWARUThe selection criteria for junior parliamentarians alienates children living with disabilitiesSpeaking on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe Child Rights Coalition Conference held in Harare last week, managing director of the Zimbabwe National Council for the Welfare of Children, Taylor Nyanhete, said lack of funding for the Junior Parliament had stifled children s participation in many issues affecting them. Lack of funding of the Junior Parliament activities has come as a limitation to child participation. It will only be fair for the Parliament to at least allocate resources as they do to senior parliamentarians. Nyanhete also implored local authorities to allocate resources to junior parliamentarians and applauded Bulawayo City Council for funding and supporting the activities of their junior councillors.In a discussion that was convened at the same conference, representatives from other non-governmental organisations also raised issues of junior parliamentarians and councillors not being active in their constituencies and societies.Discussion panellists also questioned the criteria being used to choose junior parliamentarians, saying it excluded children living with disabilities and students who are not exposed to debate and public speaking and those living on the streets.Participants also lashed out at the government structures for the Junior Parliament describing them as tokenistic and that there was no legal framework to support the operation of the junior council.Junior councillors who were present also shared their side of the story, saying they were passionate about helping and meeting the homeless and children living with disabilities, but there were no resources.A junior councillor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that even their senior counterparts were letting them down because they were not getting involved in the issues that concern children. Our seniors are not getting involved and are not helping us to address issues concerning children in our societies, she said.
