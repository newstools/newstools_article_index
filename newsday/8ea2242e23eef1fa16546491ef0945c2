Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) leader, Joice Mujuru, yesterday said a grand coalition to challenge President Robert Mugabe in the 2018 elections was inevitable, adding various opposition parties were now tying loose ends before signing the proposed coalition pact. By Tatenda ChitaguSpeaking at the burial of ZimPF Masvingo provincial spokesperson, Kudzai Mbudzi, yesterday in Marisa village under Chief Charumbira, Mujuru said leaders of opposition parties were now closer to finding each other. As political parties, we will discover each other. We are fighting for the same cause. There are only a few issues that we agreed that need to be ironed out first, she said.Mujuru said leaders of opposition parties needed to do away with their inflated egos to save the people of Zimbabwe, who were suffering under Mugabe s 36 years of misrule that had triggered an unending economic crisis. As political leaders, we need to deflate our egos and unite for the benefit of the people. They (Zimbabweans) have suffered enough and all they want is change. Zimbabweans want to live well, whether they belong to MDC-T or ZimPF, she said. We should fulfil the wishes of Zimbabweans, yet some of us need recognition. That is useless. You should accept if you cannot do some of these things. Zimbabweans are suffering. Some of us have egos that they want to be massaged all the time. We should sit down and agree where we do wrong or right. Some are lying about leaders, something hurting the country. Mujuru blasted ZimPF members involved in factional fights. ZimPF, why are we fighting? What are we telling Zanu PF? What are they learning from us? Egos should end &#8230; we are working for the people, she said.Mbudzi succumbed to an undisclosed illness at a private hospital in Harare on Sunday.
