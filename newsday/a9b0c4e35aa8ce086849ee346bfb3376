GOVERNMENT has drafted a Bill with proposed amendments to the Companies Act, as it sets its sights on a ranking of below 100 on the World Bank ease of doing business rankings. BY TATIRA ZWINOIRAZimbabwe s current position on the international ease of doing business rankings is 155 out of 189.The Bill is currently waiting to be submitted to the Attorney-General s Office before it goes to Cabinet then Parliament.In his mid-term fiscal review of the half year last week, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa said that legislative reforms towards the ease of doing business also included ancillary legislation besides the Companies Act. These administrative and legislative reforms were in the areas of starting a business and protecting minority investors, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency, getting credit, paying taxes and trading across borders, construction permits and property registration. Legislative reforms are targeting the Companies Act and ancillary legislation, while the other facet deals with reforming the procedural, time and cost elements of doing business, he said. As the ease of doing business initiative progresses, Zimbabwe s ranking is targeted at below 100 by the end of 2016, with further ranking improvement anticipated in the medium term. Chinamasa said part of the ease of doing business reforms included the removal of impediments to exporting, as it was the major source of liquidity.Findings from United States Agency for International Development s (USAid) recently concluded Strategic Economic Research and Analysis (2011-2016) in partnership with the Zimbabwe Investment Authority, found the country needs nine procedures to set up a business, one more than the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa average of eight.This comes as it takes an average of 90 days to start a business compared to the regional average of 31 days. Considerations are being made to reduce the cost of business licences to $200 from $520, with a revenue sensitivity study to be undertaken by the City of Harare.The major milestone recorded under the several ease of doing business initiatives taken was on starting a business and protection of minority investors, which now takes 15 days from a previous of 30.USAid said in order for the government to attain world class status, it needed to consider changes in several areas.USAid said some of these areas include merging name reservation and company registration procedures , automating name reservation, implement a single online application, flatten the fee structure, and consider incorporating bank account openings. Consolidate registration: registrations with the National Social Security Authority and Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund should be merged into the initial incorporation process under the registrar, USAid said.
