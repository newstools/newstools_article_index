THE Zimbabwe Junior Golf Association (ZJGA) will host a fundraising golf day at Chapman Golf Club next month in a bid to raise resources for the development of golf in the country for the period to December 2017. BY DANIEL NHAKANISOZJGA president Themba Sibanda said they were extending invitations to individuals and corporates to support the fundraising golf day, which will be held on October 7. The funds raised are intended to meet the travelling, accommodation and general expenses for the junior golfers on their upcoming local, regional and international tours as well as hosting international tournaments which give our juniors the opportunity to experience competitive golf against golfers from other countries, Sibanda said in a statement. Zimbabwe s junior golfers have excelled in regional and international competitions with the country qualifying for the last three editions of the prestigious Toyota Junior Golf World Cup held annually in Nagoya, Japan.The country is also expected to host next year s edition of the prestigious All-Africa Junior Golf Challenge.However Sibanda, a former rugby administrator, said his association s main objective for raising funds was to help provide opportunities for budding golfers from less privileged backgrounds. We feel there is also a need to identify talent among the less privileged in our community. During the national junior tournaments which we hold during school holidays, we make an effort to cater for the less privileged junior golfers from all over the country by providing them with accommodation, meals and transportation. The next tournaments will be held this December, he said.Sibanda said companies and individuals involvement can be in the form donations in cash and/or in kind, participating in the tournament itself, sponsoring tee boxes or greens at Chapman on the day of the tournament and offering items for auctioning on the day or providing prizes.ZJGA has one of the finest development programmes in the world as evidenced by the number and quality of players who have come through the junior ranks. Some of the top players who have made their mark in the field of international golf after coming through the development programme include former world number one Nick Price, Tony Johnstone, Mark McNulty, Brendon de Jonge, the late Lewis Chitengwa (Jnr) and most recently Scott Vincent, among others.
