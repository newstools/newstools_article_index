With 11 points separating the top four teams in the race for the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title, an intriguing finish is expected despite the tough run-in for all the sides involved. BY HENRY MHARAFC Platinum lead the log standings with 47 points after their 1-0 win over How Mine at the weekend and Caps United are second, just a point behind.Third-placed Highlanders are six points behind the log leaders on 41 points, while ZPC Kariba (36 points) are fourth and are still in with a chance of snatching the title.And as the race nears a tantalising finish, a cursory look at each of the four teams fixtures points to a tough seven-week Premier League period, where leadership could be swapped a bit.FC Platinum, with a point advantage, remain favourites and the team to beat in the final stretch, but a closer look at the top teams remaining fixtures appears to suggest that Highlanders have a more favourable run-in, at least on paper.Their win against Dynamos at the weekend was a big statement of intent, which should give them a huge boost, as they aim for a title they last won exactly a decade ago.Of Bosso s remaining opponents, only FC Platinum and Harare City look daunting, with the other fixtures against teams in the league s lower reaches.Four of their last seven matches are at home, against beatable opponents and their supporters would surely look at those with glee and optimism.The Bulawayo giants biggest challenge would be to collect maximum points at Harare City and FC Platinum. The equation is trickier for FC Platinum. They have to win at least five of their remaining matches to reach at least 60 points, which has been the magic number to win the league in recent years.They have two tricky fixtures against title rivals in Highlanders and Dynamos, while a trip to Harare City is a potential banana skin.Caps United appear to have the hardest run-in of all the title contenders. A trip to ZPC Kariba and two Harare derbies against Dynamos and Harare City. ZPC Kariba are still in with a fighting chance, although it would need a modern-day football miracle for Sunday Chidzambga s side to win the title.
