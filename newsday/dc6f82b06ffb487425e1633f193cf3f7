The Zimbabwe Council for Tourism (ZCT) has embarked on an exercise to ensure greater participation by operators in the affairs of the travel and tourism sector. BY TARISAI MANDIZHASpeaking at a media briefing in Harare on Wednesday, ZCT president Francis Ngwenya said there has been a few operators in decision-making and in day-to-day involvement in the work being undertaken to safeguard the sector and its future. This cannot be left to just a few operators and we, in ZCT would like to see a situation in which all the sub-sectoral associations under ZCT have full membership of every operator in each and every one of those subsectors, with no-one left out of the equation or the work process, he said.On Wednesday, ZCT held a meeting with representatives of airlines to ensure that they were members of the Board of Airlines Representatives.He said ZCT would call for similar meetings in other sub sectors to create a united family and a ZCT that was adequately funded and well-informed. Ngwenya said the sector has to make the tourism attractions more accessible to greater numbers of disadvantaged people, such as those with disabilities and lower income as tourism was not the domain of the wealthier.
