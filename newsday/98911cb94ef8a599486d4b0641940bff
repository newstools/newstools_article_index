BULAWAYO s 20-member interdenominational gospel outfit, Dumisa, is this Saturday night set to record their live DVD album at Word of Life International church in the city. BY SINDISO DUBEGospel outfit DumisaThe album, Umalusi Wami, is the outfit s second project after their debut, Sebawothe. Umalusi Wami is also the theme of the concert. The ensemble s name, Dumisa, is a Ndebele term meaning to praise and was inspired by Psalms 148. The ensemble s publicist, Mncedisi Nyathi said said Dumisa, which was formed in 2014, was built on team work. Most of the songs are about God s love, and hope in a troubled world, with impressive lyrics and genres compatible with all age groups. We write our own songs as a team, one brings an idea and we build it together into a song, he said. We invite every gospel fan to come and join us, as we fellowship through music. For us, success would mean impacting generations and when we impact lives for Jesus, we would have lived our dream. The concert is an interdenominational praise and worship expression with the best gospel artistes that include Vocal EX, Adrian, Encounter, Maxinne, Tehillah, and Spirit Praise. Since its formation, Dumisa has performed at major events like the Zimpraise Choir Festival, Word of Life International Ministries Silver Jubilee Celebrations (2015), United Refineries Image Soap Launch, Global Leadership Summit (2014 and 2015), Ibumba Festival (2016), and Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe (EFZ) Worship Night in Bulawayo (2016).They have also shared the stage with Takesure Zamar, ZimPraise, Vocal Ex, Mkhululi Bhebhe, Dudu Manhenga, Pastor G and Eric Moyo.On April 18, they had their debut live concert dubbed I am Free, which drew an attendance of over 800 people.The outfit plans to establish the Dumisa School of Arts (Dusa) which will be a centre for arts development, nurturing of talent and career development.
