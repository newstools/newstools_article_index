WARRIORS star, Khama Billiat kickstarts the final leg of his bid to become only the second Zimbabwean player to win a Caf Champions League medal, a feat which, if achieved, would bring him closer to claiming the best African player plying their trade on the continent. by Kevin MapasureBilliat s Mamelodi Sundowns clash with Egyptian giants Zamalek in the first leg of the 2016 Caf Champions League final at the Lucas Moripe Stadium this afternoon. The 26-year-old has been the shining light for the South African champions in their quest to claim their first Caf Champions League title.He has been one of the most outstanding players such that he has attracted the attention of several clubs, including Zamalek, who are believed to have made an offer to sign him.Chris Samakweri, who won the Caf Champions League with Democratic Republic of Congo giants TP Mazembe in 2010, is the only Zimbabwean with a winners medal from the continental club showpiece.Samakweri made a substitute appearance in the first leg of the final against Esperance, which TP Mazembe won 5-0 at home.He, however, missed the second leg in Tunisia.Dynamos went close in 1998, but they faltered in the final against Ivory Coast giants Asec Mimosas.For Billiat, the big moment has finally arrived, where he can use the stage to keep knocking on European doors.There have been several proposed moves to Europe, but nothing has yet materialised for the Aces Youth Academy product.Having been named the best player in the South African league for the 2015-16 season, he has an opportunity to add to his personal honours for a continental award.Five-time Caf champions, Zamalek will be desperate to take the big prize, but Sundowns will fancy their chances, especially with the talents of Billiat, Keagan Dolly and Leonardo Castro in their ranks.Sundowns will have their eyes on the prize money pegged at $3,5 million, which players and officials will share if they win.
