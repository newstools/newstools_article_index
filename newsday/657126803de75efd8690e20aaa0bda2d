A HARARE woman, who allegedly caused the arrest of Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association chairperson, Christopher Mutsvangwa s son, Neville, on charges of rape, yesterday told a Harare regional magistrate that she did not file a rape charge with the police. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEThe complainant in the matter stunned the State when she revealed that, Neville did not rape her at all, but she was angry with him because he forced her to suck her menstrual blood off his private parts soon after they had sexual intercourse.The woman disowned her statement to the police, saying she only laid indecent assault charges. Your worship, I never reported that Neville raped me, but I reported that Neville forced me to suck his private parts, which had my menstrual blood. Otherwise, I only wanted him to apologise. I never thought the case would come to court, she said.Upon being asked by Neville s lawyer, Harrison Nkomo, which statement of evidence she wanted the court to adopt, she said it should accept what she said in court, adding she was in love with the accused, an assertion the latter dismissed.Nkomo further suggested to the woman she was a prostitute, who was fond of terrorising men who failed to pay her for sexual encounters. She was also reminded of an incident where another man reported her to the police after she had refused to disembark from his vehicle while arguing over payment.Nkomo further asked the woman if she knew Neville s phone number or his place of residence and she said she did not have those details. Magistrate, Hosiah Mujaya remanded the trial to today for the inspection in loco at Mutsvangwa s offices.George Manokore appeared for the State.
