BY DESMOND CHINGARANDERogers Emmanuel Mukaro, who owns Plaintech (Pvt) Limited, was not asked to plead when he appeared before provincial magistrate Tendai Mahwe and was remanded to October 26 on $500 bail.Allegations against Mukaro and his alleged accomplice, Kudakwashe Muchena, who is still at large, are that on September 22 this year, Muchena phoned Imperial Refrigeration from South Africa indicating that he was in a position to supply South African rands to the company s suppliers in the neighbouring country and would in turn require the equivalent amount in United States dollars payable in Zimbabwe.The State alleges, Imperial Refrigeration, which gets its raw materials from South Africa, was agreeable and promised to release the US dollars after a confirmation of deposit from its South African supplier.The firm allegedly instructed Muchena to pay R378 000 into Frigoglass South s FNB Bank account and R337 895 into Metrackark (Pvt) Limited s Nedbank account respectively.The State alleges on September 24 an unknown person sent a scanned copy of deposits to the FNB Bank account for R128 000 and R250 000 and to the Nedbank account for R195 000 and R142 000 to the refrigeration firm through a WhatsApp platform as confirmation of the deposits.
