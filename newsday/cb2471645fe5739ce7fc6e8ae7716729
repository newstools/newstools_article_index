THE opposition MDC-T yesterday said it had set up its own probe team on five Bulawayo councillors, who have been implicated in shady deals and recently suspended by Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere. by PAIDAMOYO MUZULUThe MDC-T national executive met in Bulawayo last Friday ahead of the party s 17th anniversary celebrations and resolved to carry out a parallel investigation into the allegations.Party spokesperson, Obert Gutu confirmed the development. We are very much concerned by the allegations and we set up a committee to conduct an investigation into the matter. I don t want to pre-empt the investigations and possible sanctions that will be meted out if the councillors are found guilty, he said. As a party, we have zero tolerance to corruption and we will do a thorough investigation and afford those accused to make their own representations, he said, but declined to give further details.A senior MDC-T member, who attended the meeting, said the party was under pressure from its funders to act on corrupt public officials. The corruption allegations cannot be underplayed as donors and funders have lots of interest to see how the party reacts to the charges against its councillors. The meeting resolved to set up a committee to investigate the issue and table recommendations to the national executive, the source said.The source added the party was in a difficult situation and expulsion of the whole council cannot be ruled out if the allegations are proven. We will be using the Kasukuwere report as the starting point to institute the forensic audit and the party may invoke the Chitungwiza provision if the case is proven, the source added.The Chitungwiza provision refers to an incident where the party expelled its entire council after councillors were implicated in a messy residential stands scam.
