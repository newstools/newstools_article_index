A video circulating on social media- seemingly taken during Wednesday&#8217;s demonstrations- appears to show a commuter omnibus filled with tear smoke driving off from a street corner surrounded by dozens of anti-riot police. People are seen to be jumping off the minibus. Our reader, Kumbirai Chibaya-Tkcee Shonha, told NewsDay via Facebook, &#8220;it happened at the corner of Nelson Mandela Avenue and Rezende Street, where (commuter omnibuses to) Mount Pleasant park, opposite Choppies Supermarket. It was something else. The kombi was full of people ready to go. That (is) when the police threw teargas canisters inside the kombi. People cried, but the police celebrated. They just wanted to disperse the people by any means. Indeed they succeeded. Some jumped off the moving kombi.&#8221;
