High Court judge Justice Maxwell Takuva has slammed shoddy investigations by the police in murder cases saying this resulted in miscarriage of justice. BY Stephen ChadengaJustice Takuva made the remarks on Thursday when he acquitted a Gweru woman who was accused of killing her boyfriend in November 2012.Febbie Chamunorwa (27), of Ascot Infill, allegedly stabbed Ashton Adias Mukucha at her home following a dispute over sex. But Chamunorwa denied the charges maintaining that Mukucha committed suicide by stabbing himself following a domestic dispute.In acquitting Chamunorwa, Justice Takuva said police evidence from the investigating officer, Sergeant Stanley Mwale, did not help the court save to expose poor investigations in the case.It emerged in court that detectives who attended the scene never photographed or video-recorded the crime scene. In addition, no fingerprints were taken from the knife used in the alleged crime nor did the investigating team bother to take clothes for analysis. The investigations were done in a shoddy manner resulting in miscarriage of justice, ruled Justice Takuva.The judge appealed to the executive arm of government to capacitate the police department particularly in establishing an effective forensic laboratory. He said the lab was in an appalling state with nothing scientific being applied in investigating cases. For years the department has failed to carry out basic tests and this is extremely alarming in view of murder cases, he said.The judge s concerns come barely a week after Home Affairs minister Ignatius Chombo commissioned top-of-the range police vehicles worth $1 million meant to maintain law and order in the country. This is despite the fact that police operate without a crime lab. The State counsel conceded that the evidence brought before the courts in this particular murder case did not discount suicide.It was the State s case that on November 17, 2012 at around 6am, Chamunorwa had a dispute with Mukucha at her home in Ascot Infill.She allegedly stabbed him with a kitchen knife on the abdomen killing him on the spot before proceeding to make a police report that the deceased had killed himself.Chamunorwa said Mukucha threatened to kill himself if she continued refusing to be intimate with him before taking a knife and stabbing himself.
