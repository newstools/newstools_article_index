A 57-YEAR-OLD village headman has been slapped with a 10-month jail term after being convicted of selling grazing land to three desperate home seekers in Beatrice. BY CHARLES LAITONMathew Ruswa, of Village 6, Ringa in Beatrice, had pleaded not guilty to fraud charges when he appeared before Chitungwiza magistrate, Francis Mapfumo recently, but was convicted after a full trial.Ruswa was then slapped with a 10-month jail term, but a portion of the sentence was suspended on condition of good behaviour and restitution, leaving him with a four-month effective jail term.The court heard sometime in October 2015, the first complainant, Alfred Chagurwa, approached Ruswa seeking land to build a house. The two agreed the cost of the portion of the land would be $350.Chagurwa paid $300 as deposit, but was later informed by locals that the land he had acquired was meant for grazing.The complainant then confronted Ruswa concerning the matter, but he assured him all was well while encouraging him to continue building his house.However, in July this year Chagurwa was informed by his sister that the district administrator had visited the area and addressed a gathering emphasising the land was strictly for grazing.Chagurwa approached Ruswa demanding his cash, but the latter had already used it.In another matter, during the same period last year, Nomatter Njawaya of Zengeza approached Ruswa seeking land to build a house and the two entered into a verbal agreement, where Njawaya was asked to pay $350.Later in January this year, Njawaya was approached by police officers, who enquired how she got the land. Upon making investigations, she discovered Ruswa had unlawfully sold her the land.However, when Njawaya confronted Ruswa, he assured her all was in order and advised her to continue building her house.In a related matter, earlier in 2014, Isaac Martin approached Ruswa seeking land to build a house and was asked to pay $500 only to be informed by other villagers that he had been sold grazing land. The matters were reported to the police, leading to Ruswa s arrest.Ruswa has now approached the High Court seeking bail pending appeal, arguing the magistrate erred in convicting him because there was evidence that the money paid by the three complainants was meant for a fencing project.Through his lawyer, Ruswa said: Further, the court a quo failed to assist an unrepresented accused person the court ought to have probed further the issue of the fencing project, as well as the reason why the witnesses had lied to the police in the first place. The matter is pending.
