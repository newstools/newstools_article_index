COURT proceedings in the rape trial of a 40-year-old Victoria Falls teacher stalled at the Hwange regional court last Friday after the alleged victim suffered an epileptic seizure and collapsed, while being cross examined by the suspect s defence lawyer. BY SILAS NKALAThis happened when the suspect, a teacher based in Chinotimba in Victoria Falls, appeared before Hwange regional magistrate, Dambudzo Malunga facing a rape charge.The victim collapsed as defence lawyer, Givemore Muvhiringi, was cross examining her, prompting the magistrate to stop proceedings and remand the matter to today for continuation.In his defence, the suspect who is the complainant s landlord, claimed that on the night of August 30 this year, he arrived home drunk and went into his room where he undressed and fell asleep.He claimed his room had no door, but is closed by a curtain. The suspect said the 15-year-old complainant later sneaked into his room, pulled him close to her demanding sex. As a man, I could not resist it. However, shortly she became violent and pushed me away, before running out of the room, the man said through his lawyer.In her evidence, the girl told the court that the suspect sneaked into her room and raped her after she had taken her epilepsy medication and was feeling drowsy. I pushed him off and ran away before, locking him inside the room, she said.She then allegedly informed her parents about the incident, leading to the suspect s arrest.
