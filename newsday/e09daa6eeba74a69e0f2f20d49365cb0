By Tinashe Mungazi Innocent Muchaneka scored the other goal as the home side managed their eighth win of the season.Muchaneka was the first on the scoresheet getting to the end of a beautiful exchange of passes between Gilbert Zulu and Mbweti after 17 minutes.Muchaneka could have completed a brace two minutes later but he shot wide.Border Strikers goalkeeper Talent Sande denied Obert Moyo with a good interception late in the first period.The second half saw Muchaneka wasting another golden opportunity to help his side stretch the lead, taking too long to pull the trigger before Godfrey Mukambi robbed him of the ball.The visitors threw punches of their own with Hugh Chikosa coming close as did Michael Variso.However, later on it was Mbweti who sealed the visitors fate with a header from a throw-in by Andrew Tandi.Chipangano gaffer, Mebelo Njekwa said the win came as relief for the team which has not been doing well at home. It s a relief for us considering that we were under a lot of pressure to produce a good performance at home, he said. This doesn&#8217;t end here. We have to try to notch up more wins. Border Strikers coach Never Malunga said his side, who sit seven points from safety, still believe they can survive in the topflight. The game was good Hwange played well we had our opportunities which could have been converted but were wasted, he said. This is not the end for us we will continue to fight, this is football where anything is possible so though we are in the red zone we will fight on to the end.
