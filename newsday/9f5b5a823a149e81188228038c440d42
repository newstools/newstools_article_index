This Monetary Policy Statement is issued in terms of Section 46 of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Act [Chapter 22:15]. The strategies and prudential policy measures in this Statement are intended to transform the economy through rebalancing it away from being a consumptive or supermarket economy to a productive one; and away from the high incidence of capital flight characterised by the externalisation of export sales proceeds to one that safeguards its hard earned foreign exchange resources.
