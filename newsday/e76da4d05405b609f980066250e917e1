COMMUTER omnibus operators plying the city-Midlands State University route have slashed fares from 50 cents to 30 cents per head in the face of stiff competition from pirate taxis, which have become a common feature in Gweru. BY Stephen ChadengaThe route is lucrative when the university is open, with transport operators competing for passengers.One kombi driver, who identified himself, as Tinashe Moyo, said pirate taxis were causing them headaches as they operate without being registered. These pirate taxis operate illegally, but because they are small, students rush to them because they are quick to fill with passengers, he said. Because of that reason, we slashed our fares so that we up the competition against them. This has come as sweet news to students and residents of the nearby Senga suburb.Efforts by registered commuter omnibus operators to have the pirate taxis barred from plying the route have hit a brick wall amid reports that traffic police officers in the Midlands capital were refusing to co-operate. We have tried without success to engage the Zimbabwe Republic Police, Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Gweru City Council, Zimbabwe National Road Authority and the Vehicle Inspection Department so that they drive away pirate operators, Gweru Taxi Association vice-chairman, Kilifford Dube said.
