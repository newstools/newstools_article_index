This weekend s international break will not affect the intriguing Castle Lager Premier Soccer League (PSL) campaign with a full programme lined up between Saturday and Wednesday despite the Warriors involvement in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier against Guinea. BY HENRY MHARAThe match between Chicken Inn and Hwange has been scheduled for Wednesday, as the former have three players on national duty in defenders Lawrence Mhlanga, Teenage Hadebe and midfielder Tafadzwa Kutinyu.The rest of the clubs are largely unaffected with Warriors coach Kalisto Pasuwa drawing most of his squad from foreign leagues.Four fixtures have been scheduled for Saturday with the clash between log leaders FC Platinum and ZPC Kariba set to be the biggest draw for many fans on the day, and should prove an intriguing contest.The pacesetters will be making the trip to Nyamhunga Stadium hoping to recover from their 1-1 draw at home to Chicken Inn on Saturday that saw their lead cut to three points by Caps United, who convincingly beat Mutare City 4-1.A win will see them stretch the lead to six points at the top, but for 24 hours at least as the Green Machine would be in action on Sunday, away to Triangle.The two teams meeting in the reverse fixture ended in ZPC Kariba s favour who inflicted FC Platinum s first defeat this season, and thus this is one match that coach Norman Mapeza knows will be a tough one.FC Platinum won this fixture convincingly last season, and Mapeza will be hoping for similar fortunes again this time.Sunday Chidzambwa s ZPC Kariba go into the match buoyed by impressive form which has seen them collecting maximum points in the last three matches, a run which has moved them to fourth on the log standings, nine behind their next opponents, with nine matches remaining. A win could see them briefly take third position as Highlanders only play on Sunday.Victory for the Sunday Chidzambwa-coached side will also be of massive benefit to Caps United who would top the standings if they beat Triangle at Gibbo Stadium the following day.However, a trip to Triangle is the last thing that Caps United would have wanted at this stage of the season where every point counts.Lloyd Chitembwe s side s previous visits to the Lowveld ended in disappointment as they were beaten 2-1 in 2014 before they were hammered 4-0 last year.But Triangle have been struggling, having lost their last two matches and it is the team s defence that might be worrying coach David Mandigora after they conceded seven goals in those two matches.Harare City will be looking to build on their 2-1 win over Bulawayo City when they take on Ngezi Platinum, who have failed to replicate the form they exhibited in the first few weeks of Tonderai Ndiraya s reign.Harare giants Dynamos had their green shoots from the Harare City victory plucked off in Ngezi after they were frustrated to a goalless draw by the league newcomers.Under-pressure coach Lloyd Mutasa will be desperate to get three points against a Chapungu side who are coming from a morale-boosting 3-0 win over Border Strikers.
