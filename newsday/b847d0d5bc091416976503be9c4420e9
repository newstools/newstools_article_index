ZAPU has hailed the suspension of five Bulawayo MDC-T councillors, including deputy mayor Gift Banda, for alleged corruption, saying the move was long overdue. BY NQOBANI NDLOVUThe councillors were suspended early this week by Local Government Saviour Kasukuwere to expedite investigations into allegations of corruption levelled against them.Zapu deputy spokesperson, Iphithule Maphosa told Southern Eye yesterday that the suspensions were a wake up call to Bulawayo residents, accusing MDC-T councillors of pursuing personal enrichment at the expense of service delivery. The MDC-T has scored a first in Bulawayo for all the wrong reasons. Bulawayo has never been under control of corrupt individuals in the form of councillors and MDC-T has just undone that illustrious record by stuffing their corrupt party members and sympathisers into council in the 2013 poll, he said. They were even deaf to the residents warnings over land deals. This must be a lesson to Bulawayo citizens that, come election time, they should vote wisely, first for indigenous Bulawayans, not political entrepreneurs imported from outside the city and secondly for parties with their interests at heart. MDC-T is all about amassing power and not about giving responsible leadership. Ethics and good governance do not exist in their syllabus. But, MDC-T organising secretary, Abednico Bhebhe scoffed at Maphosa s claims, saying the Zapu official should concentrate on resuscitating his dead party . They are not commenting truthfully, they lack an understanding of issues. On the alleged corruption charges, councillors have always had certain privileges and even Zapu councillors, who were once in charge of council affairs, can testify to that, he said. They benefited through the same system and to then turn around and claim the MDC-T is corrupt is shallow propaganda. They should rather concentrate on resuscitating their dead party.
