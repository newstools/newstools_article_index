Kotwa growth point in Mudzi has been hit by serious water shortages after its main water source, Nyamuwanga Dam, dried up in August, leaving thousands of residents stranded. BY REJOICE CHINGWARUThe Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) has since injected over $120 000 into a project to pump water from Dendera Dam and save the dry centre.Zinwa Mazowe catchment manager, Farai Manzira told NewsDay during a tour of the area that the project involved the construction of an over-8km-long water pipeline. It took us about a month to finish this project and we are delighted that the people of Kotwa are now getting water, although there is a lot of rationing, he said.However, Manzira said the Dendera project was only short term, as the water would not last until February next year. The long-term project that will ensure sufficient supplies of water costs about $3 million, he said.Acting Mudzi district administrator, Priscilla Maguto urged Zinwa to pump water from the much bigger Kudzwe Dam, which has the capacity to supply the whole district until the next rainy season. Water shortages have become a serious problem in Kotwa and we fear disease outbreaks, she said. Most households have flush toilets, but we were at the risk of contracting cholera because there was no water to drink, let alone to flush toilets.
