UPCOMING musician and Safeguarding Young people campaign ambassador, Bryan K, launched a video for his new song, Rudo, last weekend at Belgravia Sports Club in Harare. BY LORRAINE MUROMOThe video is meant to compliment the Safeguarding Young People programme, a regional initiative implemented by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to identify and scale up interventions to improve sexual and reproductive health in adolescents and young people in east and southern Africa.In a statement, Bryan K said he was excited to have worked with the UNPFA on the project. I am so excited to be working with UNFPA on this project, as it is a chance for me to give back to my community. I have been involved with the SYP since 2014 and it s so cool to see how much the project has grown, reaching more and more young people. I think it s very important for us as young people to have information on sexual reproductive health and relationships so that at least we can make informed decisions, he said.The music project brings together six artistes from Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, who worked together on the album titled We Will to encourage the uptake of sexual reproductive health services.Meanwhile, SAYWHAT, a youth organisation under the sponsorship of the UNPFA, launched a new online app known as TuneMe, programmed to ensure that young people in Zimbabwe have access to critical information about sexual reproductive health and relationships.
