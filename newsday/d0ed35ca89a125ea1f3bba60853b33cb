THE Gwanda community has channelled its Community Share Ownership Trust (CSOT) funds towards establishment of irrigation projects and construction of clinics and schools science laboratories. BY MTHANDAZO NYONIAddressing journalists at a tour of community projects organised by the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (Zela) on Tuesday, Gwanda CSOT administrator, Costa Nkala said mining companies operating in the district had contributed $6 million for community development projects. We got the money from three mining companies, namely, PPC Zimbabwe, Blanket Mine and Jessie Mine. The money was used to build three clinics, five science laboratories, as well as buying a drilling machine. We have also two irrigation schemes, he said.A number of schools in Matabeleland South province operated without science laboratories and could not benefit from the government-initiated science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) programme to encourage the uptake of science subjects by students.Zela officials noted that most CSOTs in other provinces had stalled due to lack of funding.These include Marange, where giant companies like Mbada Diamonds, Anjin, DMC, Marange Resources and Jinan operated and Mutoko.The five diamond mining companies in Marange were supposed to contribute $50 million ($10 million each) to Zimunya Marange CSOT, but none had done so until their licences were revoked early this year.As at February 2015, Marange Resources and Mbada Diamonds had released $250 000 and $200 000 respectively.In Mutoko, only three of the six mining companies contributed a combined $67 500 to the fund.CSOTs were set up by the government to force mining companies plough back into the communities they were operating in.
