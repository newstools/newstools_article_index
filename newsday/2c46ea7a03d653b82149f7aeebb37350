MATABELELAND north-based Lupane State University (LSU) has organised a fund-raising golf tournament in Victoria Falls to raise at least $100 000 for the construction of a campus clinic. BY LUYANDUHLOBO MAKWATILSU spokesperson, Zwelithini Dlamini, said the health facility is urgently needed, as students will be relocating soon from Bulawayo to the campus in Lupane. As you know, we have a planned relocation, we are inviting all golfers to come and support, us as we try to put a health facility in place for our students, he said. Currently, we have St Lukes and Lupane clinics. If you look at these two health facilities, St Luke s is 30km away, while the local clinic might be overwhelmed, as the numbers increase. So we are encouraging golfers to come and support us, as we want to reach our $100 000 target. The organisers of the tournament which, will be held at Elephant Hills Golf Club, are inviting all interested golfers to register with the university through the bursar s office. The tournament is set for September 24.Dlamini said they were working flat out to fundraise for the construction of a health facility at the university because the current facilities are very far and the local clinic may not cope with the demand once students relocate.Vice-President Phekelezela Mphoko is expected to grace the event.In March, Mphoko led a group of politicians, academics and captains of industry in a golf tournament held at Harry Allen Golf Club in Bulawayo to raise funds to purchase computers for the university.
