People s Democratic Party (PDP) leader Tendai Biti last week endorsed Zimbabwe People First leader Joice Mujuru as their preferred Presidential candidate for 2018. By Never Zisengwe,Our ReaderPeople s Democratic Party (PDP) leader Tendai BitiThis early endorsement comes at a time that MDC-T and ZimPF are said to be at an advanced stage in negotiating for a grand coalition.This early endorsement indicates that Biti s rift with MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai is still there and that he is prepared to use whatsoever influence he may have to ensure that Tsvangirai will never have an iota of chance to be President of Zimbabwe, not in a thousand years. He has not only stopped at that. He is pushing for the so-called National Transitional Authority (NTA) which is made up of academics so as to come into power through the backdoor.I am happy that both MDC-T and ZimPF are said to be very sceptical of the NTA We Zimbabweans must not be fooled by the so-called academics who believe they know it all and want to hijack the revolution. The country is taken forward by those who understand the aspirations of the common people, those who speak the language of the people, to quote the late great Chairman Mao of China. These are the qualities that Mujuru and Tsvangirai currently hold.Fellow Zimbabweans lest we forget, the Cabinet of 2000 was filled with doctors, but that Cabinet goes down in history as the forerunners of our demise.ZimPF and MDC-T should not just embrace everyone simply because they are in opposition. They should embrace those who have a visible constituency, not those who cannot even organise a thousand men march. The future of Zimbabwe is in your hands.
