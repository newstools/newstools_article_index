Zimbabwe will hold the belated World Tourism Day celebrations in Kwekwe on Friday as government moves to market other tourist resorts, Tourism and Hospitality Industry deputy minister Anastacia Ndlovu has said. BY REJOICE CHINGWARUThe celebrations were supposed to have been held last month.At a Press briefing yesterday, Ndlovu said the ministry was moving away from holding celebrations in Victoria Falls and Kariba destinations, which have been over-marketed. We have chosen Kwekwe as this year s venue because we want to diversify and market other places since resort towns like Victoria Falls and Kariba are over-marketed, she said.Ndlovu also said the ministry was supporting this year s World Tourism Day theme, Tourism For All, by ensuring that people with disabilities have equal rights to tourism services and opportunities. As a ministry, we strongly believe that disability is not inability and we want to ensure that people with disabilities access independent travel, accessible facilities, trained tourism staff, reliable information and inclusive marketing, she said. We have, therefore, made it a priority to mainstream disability issues as an integral part of relevant strategies of sustainable development, which will ensure that tourism policies and practices are inclusive of people with disabilities, giving rise to equitable and accessible tourism.
