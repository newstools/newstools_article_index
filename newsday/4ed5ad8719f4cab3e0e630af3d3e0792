THE Bulawayo High Court on Tuesday granted an interdict order, barring State Security minister Kembo Mohadi s wife, Tambudzani, from illegally occupying Makado Farm owned by a white commercial farmer, George Watson. In August this year, Tambudzani, the Zanu PF Senator for Beitbridge, mobilised a group of party supporters, invaded and claimed ownership of Watson s farm. This prompted the commercial farmer to file an urgent application at the Bulawayo High Court seeking an order barring the Senator from illegally grabbing the property. In his application, Watson cited Tambudzani, a Beitbridge councillor, Amon Ntuteni Ndou, Herbert Siyoka, Zanu PF Matabeleland South provincial chairperson, Rabelani Choeni, as well as Lands minister Douglas Mombeshora.After several postponements, Justice Nokuthula Moyo, on Tuesday ordered Tambudzani and the other respondents to stop disrupting operations at the banana farm, measuring 2 000 hectares.Watson s lawyer, Nathan Mashayamombe, from the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, said the respondents should file their opposing papers within 10 days. We have just won a temporary relief order. If the respondents fail to respond within 10 days, we will proceed to seek the confirmation of the judge s provisional order, he said.While the rest of the respondents were not represented, the Lands ministry was represented by the Attorney General s office.
