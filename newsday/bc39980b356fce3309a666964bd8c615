BY SILAS NKALAZimPF Bulawayo provincial spokesperson Geniva Sibanda allegedly sent a WhatsApp message saying Zapu had recycled deadwood .Sibanda s remarks were leaked to Zapu deputy spokesperson Iphithule Maphosa who immediately raised the red flag, saying the utterances were likely to scupper opposition parties negotiations towards forming a coalition.Yesterday, ZimPF s spokesperson Methuseli Moyo apologised to Zapu and said Sibanda s remarks were not sanctioned by the party. For the record, Sibanda statement was unsanctioned by ZimPF, he said. In as much as Sibanda is free to hold personal opinions, it has been brought to his attention that his conduct in this instance was unbecoming of a leader and must never be repeated. ZimPF has tasked the local party leadership to personally convey our unreserved apology to Zapu and Dabengwa, who we regard highly for his service to this nation for the past five decades. Moyo described Dabengwa as an undisputed liberation war icon. ZimPF takes this opportunity to reaffirm our support and congratulates Zapu, the founder and authentic liberation movement of Zimbabwe, for a successful, peaceful and exemplary congress and wish to assure them of our commitment in working side by side with other opposition forces to deliver a prosperous, just and democratic Zimbabwe at the next elections, he said.Sibanda reportedly made the statements last Friday, following Dabengwa s re-election as the party leader.He is said to have likened Dabengwa s recent re-election as Zapu leader to galvanising old re-treaded tyres , suggesting that the former Zipra intelligence supremo had outlived his political usefulness.
