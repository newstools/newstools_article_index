A MATABELELAND human rights lobby group has accused the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education of administrative bungling, resulting in Negasha Primary School, in Hwange East, failing to reopen for the third term. BY NQOBANI NDLOVUThe school reportedly has no teachers, which led to its failure to reopen.The Matabeleland Institute for Human Rights (MIHR) expressed concern over the issue, describing it as a clear picture of the continued structural rights violations in the region due to administrative failures of central government. This failure by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to ensure that there is proper learning at Negasha Primary School is a clear violation of children s rights as enshrined in Section 19 (1), (2) (d) and (3)(b) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, read together with Section 81(1)(d) and (e) and (2), MIHR general-secretary Benedict Sibasa said.He called on the Primary and Secondary Education ministry as well as the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Education to ensure Negasha reopened as a matter of urgency. As an independent human rights watchdog and think-tank, MIHR calls on the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to speedily ensure that pupils at Negasha Primary School are accorded the respect and dignity befitting all Zimbabwean children by ensuring the resumption of proper learning in that school, Sibasa said. We urge the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission to speedily investigate the Negasha Primary School issue and ensure that the rights of children in that community are respected and fulfilled. He said government should also devolve powers to provinces, so as to ensure that there is respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms through timely and appropriate service delivery .Primary and Secondary Education minister Lazarus Dokora could not be reached for comment yesterday.A number of schools face teacher shortages, particularly Science and Maths educators, while the majority are operating without school heads.According to a recent circular from the Civil Service Commission, out of the 620 primary schools in Matabeleland North, 359 have substantive school heads, which means 261 of the schools were being run by unqualified personnel.
