RISING Zimbabwean professional golfer Scott Vincent stormed up the leaderboard in the second round of the $1 million Shinhan Donghae Open in South Korea yesterday to put himself in a strong position to claim a maiden title on the lucrative Asian Tour. BY DANIEL NHAKANISOScott VincentThe 24-year-old US-based golfer made his presence felt after firing a sizzling seven-under-par 64 at the Bears Best Cheongna Golf Club in Incheon to move up 15 places into a tie for fourth, two shots off the lead held by Thailand s Thitiphun Chuayprakong at 11-under-par.Vincent s bogey-free second round which came on the back of an opening 69 on Thursday included seven birdies, three of which came in his last four holes.The Chapman Golf Club product said his anonymity in the star studded field played a significant role in his good showing at the Bears Best Cheongna Golf Club. It s nice coming here where no one really knows who you are and you have no expectations. I m just playing my own game and so far it has been great. If I keep this up, hopefully I ll move in the same directions as those top guys, Vincent said.Home favourite Taewoo Kim matched his opening day s 66 to stay one shot back of Chuayprakong with his two-day total of 10-under-par 132 while India s Gaganjeet Bhullar also found form again with a 66 to stay in contention at the Shinhan Donghae Open.Two-time former Golden Pilsener Zimbabwe Open champion Jbe Kruger of South Africa is tied for seventh position on seven-under-par. Zimbabwe golf fans will however be following Vincent s perfomance in Korea with keen interest as the former St Johns College student continues to impress after a commendable debut season on the Canadian professional circuit.Vincent managed three top finishes in 13 starts to finish in 20th position on the PGA Tour Canada Order of Merit Standings, which earned him an exemption into the second stage of Web.com Tour Q-School later this year.The Web.com Tour is the main developmental tour in the US and the main pathway for players hoping to earn playing privileges on the money-spinning US PGA Tour.
