Zimbabwe national cricket team players will warm up for their impending Test series against Sri Lanka by playing a visiting Pakistan A side later this month. BY Kevin MapasurePakistan A is expected in Harare on September 23 with the first of five one-day matches against Zim A set for September 25.After the limited-overs series, Pakistan A will take on Zim A in two four-day matches, where first team players are expected to take part, as they fine-tune for the Sri Lanka series.The national team players should have resumed training, but have been held up by the delay in the issuance of new contracts after their deals expired at the end of last month.Zimbabwe Cricket is also in the process of searching for a new coach, with the submission of applications having closed last Friday.It is understood, however, that former Zimbabwe captain, Heath Streak is in line to fill the post, which became vacant with the sacking of Dav Whatmore in May this year.Streak has already spoken of his desire to shift from being a specialist coach to become head of the technical department.He was the Zimbabwe bowling coach before he moved to Bangladesh in a similar role, while he has also coached in the Indian Premier League in that capacity.In the meantime, Makhaya Ntini is expected to continue presiding over the team until an appointment has been made.Zimbabwe lost their ODI series to India in June under Ntini s watch before they were soundly beaten by New Zealand in their two-match Test series, which was played in Bulawayo in July and August.The local players, who had gone for almost two years without playing Test cricket, looked lost in the longer version of the game.The Pakistan A series would afford them the needed game time before they engage Sri Lanka in Tests.Some of the players expected to feature in the Pakistan Test such as Prince Masvaure and Peter Moor, received some game time when they featured for the development side that played Sri Lanka recently.
