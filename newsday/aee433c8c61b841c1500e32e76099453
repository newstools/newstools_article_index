MULTI-AWARD winning musician, Jah Prayzah and South Africa-based Zimbabwean singer, Queen Vee are currently riding on a crest of a wave, with their videos being among the Africa s best, as they were featured in the Top 10 of the Africa Hit 30, which aired on DStv s music channel, Trace Africa on Saturday. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOThe smashing video, Watora Mari, which Jah Prayzah featured Tanzanian s Diamond Platnumz, occupied seventh position, while the former Miss Zimbabwe, Queen Vee s video, Mari Mari, where she collaborated with dancehall icon, Soul Jah Love, was eighth. The high-definition video from the rising RnB songstress, Queen Vee, real name Vanessa Sibanda, is also receiving massive airplay on DStv s Channel O, after its premiere in April.Queen Vee is slowly positioning herself as a top female musician having recently broken into the BBC Radio s 1 Xtra Music Bot playlist.On the other hand, Jah Prayzah continues to score big, as his video, Watora Mari, in August, set a new record on the local music scene, after it clocked one million views just three weeks after its release on YouTube.The video, which is already on the Zambezi Magic Zim Top 10, has also been shortlisted for the forthcoming MTV Africa Music Awards (Mamas) 2016.Jah Prayzah is the first Zimbabwean to be nominated for the prestigious awards in the Listeners Choice Award category.In this category, Jah Prayzah will battle it out with 20 other top African artistes such as Bebe Cool (Uganda), Burna Boy (Nigeria), Prince Kaybee (South Africa) and Yamoto Band (Tanzania).Efforts to get a comment from Queen Vee s camp were fruitless yesterday.Jah Prayzah s manager, Keen Mushapaidze saluted their fans, saying it shows they appreciate the dreadlocked singer s music. We are excited to be in the African Hits 30 with the Watora Mari video, he said. The song has been doing well both locally and internationally. And having it now in the top 10 of all current African videos on Trace Africa is more than a milestone for us. We hope the momentum will keep going until, us as Zimbabweans, get the much needed attention from everyone out there. We have achieved all this because of our fans unwavering support. The introduction of the Trace Africa music channel has been well received by local artistes, as it gives them the much-needed exposure.
