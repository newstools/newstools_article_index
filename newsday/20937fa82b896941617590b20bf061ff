The Insurance and Pensions Commission (Ipec) says players in the financial services sector have to introduce products that cater for the changing needs of society, thereby, accelerating government s financial inclusion thrust. BY BUSINESS REPORTERSpeaking at the launch of a funeral package by Ecosure, Thwala Sonke, Ipec s head of prudential supervision, Pupurai Togarepi said insurance companies should use technology to tap into the lower end of the market. We are encouraging financial players not only to look at the upper echelons, but also the disadvantaged people. It s people at the lower end that require insurance, he said.Togarepi said Ipec would put in place regulations to protect the rights and interests of those who buy insurance products in line with the changing needs of the Zimbabwean market. He said the regulator would look at the relevance of the product to the Zimbabwean market adding this would not lower the regulator s oversight role. We are keen to see financial inclusion succeeding in Zimbabwe, Togarepi said.Thwala Sonke (which means carry all in English) allows existing and potential policyholders to cover their immediate and extended family members directly from their mobile phones. Dependents do not need to be Econet subscribers, as long as the policyholder is registered on Econet s mobile money service, EcoCash. Ecosure is a unit of telecoms firm, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe.
