FORMER Vice-President Joice Mujuru has saluted opposition MDC-T Morgan Tsvangirai for braving President Robert Mugabe s dictatorship from 1999 to date, when it was perceived as too risky to challenge the Zanu PF leader. BY BLESSED MHLANGAMujuru, who now leads the opposition Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) made the remarks while addressing party supporters at a rally in Luton, United Kingdom, last week. Zimbabweans should thank Tsvangirai and his team. They taught us courage, that we did not have, something that even shocked us in Zanu PF regardless of the fact that I am a trained soldier. He understood that the liberation struggle was fought to bring us freedom to challenge our leaders, she said.Mujuru, who appealed to her followers to stop judging her on her past association with the corrupt and insensitive government of Mugabe, described the Zanu PF leader as a bully. Mugabe lost direction of the values of the liberation struggle long back, but we could not challenge him internally because we feared him and for me it was also because I was young, she said.Mujuru said Mugabe had dragged the whole country into a mess with his policies that he unilaterally introduced. One person just introduces policies without consultation and everyone follows sheepishly because we were afraid, she said.The former VP said Mugabe was so drunk with power to the extent that he believed he was the President of Africa. He thinks he is the President of Africa and without even consulting he declared he will pull out Africa from the United Nations. If he had that power he would do it the same way he pulled Zimbabwe out of the Commonwealth without consulting the people. She also disclosed that ZimPF was working closely with the MDC-T and Tendai Biti s People s Democratic Party in the fight to bring down the Mugabe regime.
