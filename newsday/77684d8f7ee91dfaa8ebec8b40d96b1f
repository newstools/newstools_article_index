FINANCE minister Patrick Chinamasa seemed to be doing the right thing when he announced a planned civil service trimdown and the suspension of bonuses, but he does not seem to be on the same wavelength with his ministerial and Zanu PF colleagues. NewsDay EditorFor the second time in as many years, Chinamasa s planned austerity measures have been shot down, meaning either Cabinet contradicts its own policies or Chinamasa is a one-man rebel.It is unthinkable that Chinamasa went ahead with his mid-term fiscal review without briefing President Robert Mugabe first and getting approval to do so.Either way, Chinamasa s position has become untenable and he should either resign in frustration or be forced out.Surely, such policy contradictions should be unheard of and if Chinamasa did indeed go against Mugabe s wishes, then he has no place in Cabinet.But what is worrying though, is that while Chinamasa issued what he thought were measures that could shore up the country s finances, his colleagues in Cabinet seem not to have any solution, but instead are quick to jump at his throat.In Information minister Christopher Mushohwe s statement on Tuesday night, he said Chinamasa s proposals had twice been shot down, but he does not say what alternative they came up with to counter the Finance minister s proposals.Surely even if it is for populist purposes, Mugabe and his government must concede that a wage bill that takes 97% of revenue is unsustainable and there should be in a position to make some cuts, no matter how unpalatable.The government struggled to pay bonuses last year, as they only completed paying the 13th cheque well into the year and it is anyone s guess how they hope to improve on the situation this time around.The government cannot be this obstinate in the face of an obvious economic collapse and sooner rather than later, they will not be able to pay salaries, let alone bonuses.It is unthinkable that the government wants to maintain salaries at their current level, as if they are oblivious to the shrinking economy.The private sector has cut salaries and allowances, while several companies have shut down, meaning the revenue government is receiving is far less than what it was a year ago and there is need for authorities to be responsive to the current realities.Chinamasa s heart and mind are in the right place, Zimbabwe needs painful austerity measures, but he is in bed with people who do not have the country s interests at heart and are willing to burn it just to remain in power.If Chinamasa has any integrity and pride, then there has never been a better time to walk away from it all, with a clear conscience and the respect of most Zimbabweans.
