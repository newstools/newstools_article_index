MISS Tourism Zimbabwe patron Barbra Mzembi has urged university and college students to participate in auditions being carried out nationwide in search of the country s most beautiful young women with potential to be Zimbabwe s tourist ambassador. BY SINDISO DUBETwo of the models at the Bulawayo auditionSpeaking during the pageant s auditions at a Bulawayo hotel on Wednesday, ahead of the grand finale on November 25 in Harare, Mzembi said they wanted more participants from tertiary institutions in line with the new requirements. Our new requirements stipulate that the girls should range from 18 to 24 years of age and should have at least a minimum of A Level educational passes. That s a must have. So, we urge educated girls from tertiary institutions to participate in our auditions as we are looking at both the beauty and the brains that will lift the country s flag high, she said. After the auditions, we will do background follow-ups on these girls, making sure that the information they provided is true. We want to eliminate the drama and controversy that has marred the industry in the past years. The Bulawayo auditions were the fifth after Harare, Masvingo, Mutare and Victoria Falls. Eighteen girls will be selected to join the boot camp set to begin on November 17 where they will go through intensive training, education on public relations, tourism, history and modelling after which three models will be trimmed off to remain with 15 finalists. A lot will be learnt from the boot camp. This this time we will camp in a private mansion not a hotel. We want to know the girls better and for them to feel at home so that they interact every minute in the house, Mzembi said.The Bulawayo judges panel was made up of Benjamin Chimutengo, Barbra Mzembi and former Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Lorraine Maphala.
