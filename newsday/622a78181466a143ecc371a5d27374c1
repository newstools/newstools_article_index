Music has been the greatest part of my life from childhood. It was until. 2008 that I started to do it professionally when I joined the Marxist Brothers led by Tryson, he said.Mugari then joined Dendera Kings in 2011 doubling as a vocalist and dancer before rejoining Marxist Brothers the following year as a manager. He resigned in 2013 to go solo.He said it was the stints with dendera musicians Sulu and Tryson that saw him gain experience and motivated him to form his outfit and added that he is overwhelmed by the response he is getting from dendera music lovers.
