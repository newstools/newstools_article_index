GOVERNMENT plans to set up a mining industry loan fund for small-scale miners as a viable vehicle for channelling support towards facilitating and promoting the capitalisation of mining operations by small scale miners. BY TARISAI MANDIZHAThere are more than 600 000 small-scale miners operating in Zimbabwe with figures of registered and unregistered artisanal miners pegged at 700 000.In his mid-term fiscal policy review last week, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa said the government will promote linkages between mining and manufacturing sectors in line with the policy on local content. He said the government will capacitate Fidelity Printers and Refineries in order to curb the diversion of gold to the black market by ensuring that it extends its gold buying centres to other areas outside the main towns and a few mining areas, as well as designating gold millers, as buying agents.Chinamasa said the government will establish a mining industry loan fund for small scale miners and review all reserved areas with a view of considering them for prospecting and pegging for interested investors .He said the mining sector was projected to register a t modest recovery growth of 13,2% in 2016, largely driven by the anticipated growth in gold, platinum group of metals and nickel. Outside of gold [sic], government will also continue to mobilise resources for the growing numbers of small scale miners producing other minerals and in need of support, Chinamasa said. He said modest gains in mining, since the onset of 2016, in terms of both output and market price trends, have been registered by most minerals, with the exception of diamonds, chrome and coal. Decline in mineral commodity prices from their peak, against the background of then strong demand, mainly from China, continues to undermine mineral proceeds realisation for our economy. In the period under review, the value of mineral output for the first half of 2016 was up by 8,8% to $806 million, from $741 million during the comparable period in 2015.Chinamasa said mineral output for gold, platinum, and nickel is expected to remain on a positive trend, while diamonds and ferrochrome output is anticipated to be subdued.Gold output stood at 10,360 tonnes in the first half of 2016, up from 8,869 tonnes produced in the comparable period in 2015 and as a result, revenues from gold exports rose from $340 million in the same period in 2015 to $415 million in the first half of 2016.Out of the 10,360 tonnes produced, large scale primary producers accounted for 55%, while 36% and 9% came from small scale and secondary producers, respectively. The positive performance in gold was also against the background of supportive measures extended to the sector by government, he said.
