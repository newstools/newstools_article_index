MINES and Mining Development deputy minister Fred Moyo has been dragged to the Labour Court by a former employee at his Lennox Gold Mine in Mashava over $80 000 in outstanding salaries and allowances. By Tatenda ChitaguChipadza Averoni Chadenga, in a matter filed under case number 278/06/16, accused Moyo of dithering over his dues, which accumulated over the past nine years, when he was a security manager at the mine. The case is set to be heard on Friday.Chadenga claims he was promoted to be mine security manager in 2011 and was entitled to a $1 500 monthly salary.Instead, Chadenga said he was given amounts ranging from $20 to $50 before he resigned in 2014 in frustration.Chadenga is also demanding overnight and night shift allowances, saying he also guarded gold being transported from the mine using traditional weapons.Moyo, through his lawyer, Wellington Muzenda, is said to have made unfulfilled promises to pay Chadenga, leaving the latter with no option, but to approach the courts for recourse.
