BY Munyaradzi MadzokereZaman s score was the second highest in an ODI match in Zimbabwe since Charles Coventry s 194 at Queens Sports Club in 2008.

Zaman shared a vital 206-run second wicket partnership with Umar Amin (83), who has 15 senior team caps, before he fell to Tendai Chatara in the 47th over. Seventeen-year-old slow left-arm bowler, Mohammed Asghar was the pick of the bolwers taking five for 41.His disciplined bowling exploits helped restrict Zimbabwe to 151 all out.Douglas Hondo s men have a chance to save the series in the third ODI to be played at the same venue tomorrow
