Life assurance companies recorded a 12% growth in net premiums to $173 million in the six months to June 30 fed by fund business and group life assurance income streams. BY BUSINESS REPORTERIn the comparable period last year, life assurers wrote $154 million in net premiums.According to a report by the Insurance and Pensions Commission (Ipec), business continued to be concentrated around the three biggest insurers Old Mutual, Nyaradzo and FML who wrote $144 million or 83% of net premium written.The report said fund business, funeral, group life assurance and other policies constituted 88% of gross written business down from 89% in the same period last year. This suggests weak financial capacity and awareness of other product lines. The spectrum of products continued to be traditional middle -to-top class products which may not be readily affordable to the general policyholder especially the informal traders, Ipec said. We continue to view the informal sector as largely unserved and as such continue to encourage product innovation biased towards this sector. For the half year ended June 30 2016, life companies paid $100 million in net claims (June 2015: $66 million), a 47% year- on- year growth rate compared to a 13% growth in premium income streams. Ipec said operational costs accounted for 21% or $29 million of total costs (June 2015:29%), claims were 73% or $100 million (June 2015: 64% or $67 million) whilst commission costs made up the balance of 6% or $8 million (June 2015:7% or $7 million). Resultantly, the combined ratio spiked from 69% in 2015 to the current 78% mainly due to the ballooning claims bill, Ipec said.
