The MDC-T Students Council condemns in the strongest terms the withholding of Tonderai Dombo, Alex Mukamba and Tembinkosi Rushwaya s certificates by the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) registrar. Fanuel Chinowaita,MDC-T Students Council National SpokespersonUnivesity of Zimbabwe students protesting at graduation ceremony held last monthThe trio have not done anything wrong, which qualifies this treatment, but have exercised their constitutional rights of demonstrating. They have not lied that there is high unemployment and worsening economic situation in the country.It is no longer a secret that the unemployment rate in the country is now over 90%, which leads to many graduates turning into vendors and cross-border traders. This must be fixed with immediate effect rather than infringing the rights of the people who demand employment.Dombo, Mukamba and Rushwaya protested to the right person: President Roberrt Mugabe, because he is the one who promised 2,2 million jobs during the 2013 election campaigns.It is very unfortunate that Mugabe has miserably failed to provide the 2,2 million promised jobs, but only managed to create one job for Simba Chikore, his son-in-law.The MDC-T Students Council denounces the decision made by the UZ registrar and demand the immediate release of the trio s certificates.
