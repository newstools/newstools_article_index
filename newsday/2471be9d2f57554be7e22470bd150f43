BULAWAYO City Council s (BCC) newly-appointed town clerk, Christopher Dube, has declared zero tolerance on corruption, saying the local authority must revert to its core values that frown against graft. BY NQOBANI NDLOVUDube s remarks follow the recent suspension of five Bulawayo councillors, including deputy mayor, Gift Banda on graft allegations.Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere, who recently dispatched a probe team to investigate BCC, has warned that the axe will fall on the remaining councillors over the same charges, revealing that only less than five city councillors were clean .Dube said he had gone through Kasukuwere s audit report, and said council will not want to repeat the same underhand-dealings that led to the minister suspending councillors over graft. The City of Bulawayo has been known as the city of excellence towards attaining good service delivery. The report, presented by the Local Government minister a few weeks back, presented a lot of challenges to the operations of Bulawayo, he told journalists at a Press briefing on Friday. As a new person coming into the organisation, one of my tasks has been to familiarise myself with the report and sit with my heads of departments to map a way towards ensuring Bulawayo attains the lost glory of the city. When one looks at the values of Bulawayo, they clearly show council s intolerance for corruption and anything that is underhand. The acceptance of the report by the councillors, staff and management of the City of Bulawayo is indicative of our wish to move forward beyond the report and correct mistakes, which have been made in the past. Dube reiterated that BCC will stick to its core values, which, among others, emphasise integrity, transparency, consultation, accountability, equal opportunities, fairness, efficiency and responsiveness.MDC-T leader, Morgan Tsvangirai has also warned that his party will not hesitate to fire corrupt councillors.
