AB Communications chief executive officer Susan Makore has said the company s two new stations, Hevoi FM (100.2FM) and 98.4 Midlands, have gone live and started broadcasting. by REJOICE CHINGWARUA B Communications chief executive officer Susan MakotoreThe launch of the stations beat the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe s end of September deadline for all licensed stations to go online. These stations are currently playing music and full spectrum broadcasts are expected soon. The delays on full spectrum are due to issues beyond AB Communications control. The outstanding aspects to do with equipment are due to the current nationwide nostro funding challenges, Makore said in a statement.She said her company made requests for payment to foreign suppliers as early as June this year, but they were delayed due to the prevailing economic conditions. The government has challenges in remitting cash for external payments due to a depletion of nostro account balances. The requests that we submitted between June and July 2016 are still to be processed when ordinarily equipment would have been delivered within six weeks, Makore added.She said the two new stations programming would be determined by the audience preferences.The coming on board of the regional stations further consolidates AB Communications market share in the media sector. It also owns one of the two national free-to-air commercial radio stations ZiFM Stereo, production house Mighty Movies, mobile advertising company TruckAds, music production house Oskid Productions and music events promotions 6 Finger Records.
