THE Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara) says funding for the National Roads Conditions Survey undertaken earlier this year is lagging behind amid early estimates that $5 billion is required to rehabilitate the country s road network. BY TATIRA ZWINOIRAThe survey was launched in April this year to conduct research on the entire road network system in the country to ascertain the extent of the road infrastructure dilapidation.Zinara chairperson Albert Mugabe told NewsDay on the sidelines of Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe roads capacity building workshop in Harare that the mindset of decision-makers needed to change as the extent to fixing road infrastructure was great. We launched a national road survey and when that is done, we will know the actual condition of our roads and be in a position to quantify what the requirements are. We launched it a little earlier this year and we hope to get some results after a year or early next year. Remember, the component of the road survey is funding and we have tried our best to ensure that the funding is in place, but every now and again, we lag behind in terms of funding, Mugabe said. Instead of looking at how much we need to fix the road network, what we actually need to do is look at it inversely, in that if we do not fix our road network, then what will be the cost? When I tell what our requirement is, it is going to be a big figure, but the bigger one is actually the cost of not fixing the road. He said the early estimated figure of $5bn needed for road infrastructure had to be substantiated, as the survey would reveal a higher figure needed as the entire road network system was beyond its lifespan.Mugabe said the main source of funding for the road survey was from the toll fees Zinara received, which were then distributed to different councils.The road survey, if well-funded, is expected to be completed at the end of the first quarter of next year.Yesterday s workshop was hosted by Lafarge Zimbabwe as part of an initiative to encourage the use of cost-cutting newer concrete road technologies that can be used in developing cheaper and more sustainable roads.One of the main technologies being championed is the use of adhesives that can keep the road together, which requires less maintenance. Another includes using hydromedia, a fast-draining type of concrete that helps to quickly minimise the risk of flooding.LafargeHolcim countries technical support engineer, Rex Titus, said the newer road materials used in road construction had the potential to improve smooth flow of business and provide support system transportation.Currently, the poor road infrastructure stems from a lack of adequate financing towards regular maintenance in the country, which has interferred with the smooth flow of business As Lafarge, we contribute to building better infrastructure in Zimbabwe through supply of materials such as cement and aggregates, as well as our technical expertise and other services. We are available to partner with government and other private players to build sustainable road infrastructure in Zimbabwe in a cost effective manner, Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe commercial director Edith Matekaire said.
