SOUTH AFRICA S duo of Theo Kgosinkwe and Nhlanhla Nciza of Mafikizolo came, shined and left merrymakers clamouring for more, as they serenaded revellers at a well-attended concert on Saturday night at Belgravia Sports Club in the capital. BY XOLISANI NCUBE/TAPIWA ZIVIRAMafikizolo perform on stage at the Belgravia Sports Club in Harare on Saturday nightThe award-winning group, belted out hit after hit and proved why they were the darling of Zimbabwe with a top-notch act, which saw thousands who had braved the chilly weather and a biting economic situation to tango all night long.Forget the poor stagework by some presenters from a private local radio station, who were constantly booed by the crowd, Mafikizolo, with their sing-along tunes like Ndihamba Nawe and Thandi Mali, among others, captivated the pack with their well-choreographed stage works.The dancers showed their prowess on the dance floor, putting the tempo beyond the reach of local artistes Jah Prayzah and Zimdancehall president Winky D, with whom they shared the stage.With the crowd already in an idyllic mood after a splendid feat from KO, another South African singer, who also warmed the stage for the main act (Mafikizolo), the duo opened their set with hit song Sibongile, sending the crowd into rapture as they joined to sing along.They wowed the crowd with their popular songs and a flawless stage choreography, showing brilliance by their dancers, much to the delight of the appreciating fans.With the country witnessing political unrest in the past weeks, it was a blissful moment for many in the face of gloom and doom Zimbabwe is going through.Before Mafikizolo and KO, award-winning Zimdancehall star Winky D gave all he could, but fell short to the visitors, as his attempt to introduce new songs proved to be a blunder as they were not well received.Only his first two songs were received well by the crowd, but when he introduced a new song-titled 25, the horde seemed not to appreciate, preferring his old tunes.The misery on the Disappear hit-maker s set appeared to have also suffered sound technical glitches, which subdued his instruments with his voice to override the instruments.High-riding Jah Prayzah appeared to be a big let-down to his fans judging from the responses from his playlist and later, the stage act.Before taking to the stage, the crowd was eagerly waiting for the Tsviriyo hit maker, but he seemed to disappoint them, particularly on the song Watora Mari from his new album Mdhara Vachauya, which he featured Tanzanian singer, Diamond Platnumz.None of his backing vocalist could simulate the Bongo Flava artiste and provide a similar flair to that witnessed on the smashing video.Jah Prayzah also had a torrid time to convince an already tired crowd that he was better than the visitors as they walked out of the venue in the midst of his performance.
