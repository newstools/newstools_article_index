FAECAL ingestion by children who end up with diarrhoeal diseases is reportedly part of the several factors contributing to stunted growth in Zimbabwe. by VENERANDA LANGAThis was said during a recent Unicef Brown Bag presentation on sanitation, hygiene, infant nutrition and efficacy by researchers from Zvitambo Institute for Maternal and Child Health Research.Zvitambo director Jean Humphrey told participants during the discussion that implementing washing, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes by minimising faecal ingestion and optimisation of children s diet can reduce clinical intestinal disorder and stunting.She said baby observation studies in 2011 that were carried out in some rural areas in the country revealed faeces get into the mouths of babies on average 38 times in six hours because 75% of the time the babies hands were dirty and were in the mouth. Children eat large amounts of dirt from the ground and end up eating chicken faeces because they live where chickens roam, Humphrey said. The average ecoli consumed per day by less than 18-month children was too much and parents should ensure children avoid eating chicken faeces and dirt while playing. Through optimising infant diet, Humphrey said it removes a third of stunted growth in children. The study revealed at two years a child with a burden of diarrhoea was 0,38% shorter than those with less diarrhoea. The reasons baby WASH is going to reduce stunting is by reducing clinical intestinal disorder, she said.Children that are stunted account for 14% to 17% under five deaths, attend less school and perform poorly at school, and in adulthood they are said to have 66% lower economic productivity and are also more likely to have stunted children. In old age, people who experienced stunted growth are said to be likely affected by chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and others.Zvitambo assistant director Naume Tavengwa said it is important for mothers to engage in exclusive breastfeeding of infants up to 24 months.Laura Smith, a research fellow with Zvitambo, said exposure to toxins produced by moulds found in maize, barley, wheat, groundnuts and others might affect child growth and cause infection in the body that diverts nutrients from growth.Zvitambo early childhood assessment assistant director Gwendoline Kandawasvika said one in three children do not reach their full development potential due to stunting.Associate director for biomedical research at Zvitambo, Andrew Prendergast, said they were undertaking trials which will inform on new approaches to stunting in Zimbabwe, adding they had already started in Shurugwi and Chirumanzu.
