GWANDA civic groups have criticised the move by the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) to install bulk water meters at the main reservoir to stop the municipality from accessing treated water without downpayment. BY NQOBANI NDLOVUGwanda owes Zinwa nearly $10 million for water deliveries.According to Zinwa, the installed four bulk water meters at the reservoir were for the Gwanda Municipality which obtains water from Zinwa for onward transmission to the town s residents.However, Gwanda civic society groups, in a petition to Zinwa, council and Gwanda Central legislator Edison Gumbo, said the explanation did not make any difference as residents would still be affected.They described the move as insensitive amid grinding hardships faced by residents as seen by their failure to pay bills on time. The proposed move by Zinwa will compromise section 77 (a) of the country s Constitution, therefore, exposing citizens to communicable diseases and unclean environment. We strongly condemn this move which proved that Zinwa did not consider the plight of residents concerned as there were no prior consultations, but thought of it as the best means of increasing its revenue collection base from Gwanda residents through Gwanda Town Council, part of the petition read.The petition, dated October 6, was signed by Juliet Nkiwane (Women Development Association in Zimbabwe), Sithabile Nkomo (Positive Women Trust), Sichasisile Ndlovu (Community Youth Development Trust) and Simbarashe Tasaranarwo (Gwanda Community Development Trust). As stakeholders in the local governance with much interest in protecting and promoting the welfare of the residents (citizens) of Gwanda, the above-mentioned CSOs and residents association representatives, we saw it fit to openly object to this move basing our arguments on the fact that the prepaid water meter system is not suitable for the current Zimbabwe economic context. We believe that if there is any need for a prepaid water system installation, that can be more suitable to all government, companies and commercial entities that use water for more than the basic requirement per month, the petition added.
