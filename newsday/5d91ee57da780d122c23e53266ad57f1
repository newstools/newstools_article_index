Edgars Stores Limited saw its profit-after-tax tumbling by 90,7% to $109 119 in the 26 weeks ended July 9, 2016 period due to declining revenue and payment of terminal benefits. BY TARISAI MANDIZHAIn the corresponding period last year, Edgars posted a profit of $1,18 million.In the period under review, revenue declined by 23% to $23,1m due to weak consumer demand, liquidity constraints and failure by companies to pay salaries on time.In a statement accompanying the group s unaudited interim results, board chairman, Themba Sibanda said the group expected a more profitable second half and the leaner business model currently in place will help us meet the less-than-favourable economic conditions .In the period under review, Edgars embarked on staff rationalisation, restructuring and remodelling the business to improve accountability, productivity, and differentiation between chains, preparation towards implementation of the new IT solution and cost-cutting measures. These initiatives have resulted in extra once-off costs amounting to $900 000 being incurred. This included retrenchment costs of $650 000, $200 000 of which relates to manufacturing. This, together with the decline in sales, has resulted in a loss before tax of $300 000 for the period (2015:$1,9 million), he said.Commenting on the retail operations, Sibanda said Edgars chain sales for the half year were 31% down to $14,5m from $21,5m in 2015.
