The objective of every procurement process is to ensure that contracts are concluded after due process that leads to the identification of the best supplier in any competition. PURCHASING &#038; SUPPLY NYASHA CHIZUBoth the private and public sectors are concerned about issues of engaging the right supplier that offers the right quality in the right quantity, at the right price and at the right time.Many contracts are concluded when the five rights do not exist.It is a fact that, every competition has a winner and a winner in a certain competition may be the worst in other leagues.Procurement officers must ensure that they identify appropriate suppliers using appropriate methods, as described in the procurement manual or procurement laws.Procurement can be likened to fishing where there are different methods of fishing, different baits and different sources of different kinds of fish.It is possible to catch a tiger fish in a bream base in a lake.Assessing the competitiveness of a procurement process, therefore, considers matters that are more than just achieving the result, but an assessment of other factors around the result.There is high risk of failure to identify potential suppliers, mainly because of the selection of an inappropriate method.It is possible to fail in total to identify potential suppliers and offers might be received from suppliers that are not suitable. A request for a quotation or proposal may close without any response.Responses in some instances may be received from chancers, who would lack the required attributes to successfully complete the contract. The risk of failing to identify potential sources is as a result of a poor procurement planning process.It a sign of lack of market knowledge and possible arm s length relationships with strategic suppliers.Deciding the strategy on how the market shall be approached is very critical.It reduces the need to approach the market several times when offers received are not satisfactory.There is risk of high price disparities that may lead to a conclusion of a contract on the basis of price ignoring other procurement fundamentals, when the price offered is very attractive at the expense of value for money procurement.A good strategy would define the means of approaching the market.This includes knowledge of market factors that may hinder participation, that include competition laws, as with the case of professional services and the general structure of the market for general goods.Such knowledge would ensure that the organisation formulates procurement policies, guidelines and practices that speak to the market. This includes the methods of inviting proposals and the scope and coverage of advertisements.There is high risk of receiving offers from unsuitable tenders if the advertisement cannot reach out to the intended market.The risk is also attributable to the quality of tender documents.The description of the requirements, as advertised, may fail to communicate appropriately to the market, leading to the attraction of unsuitable suppliers.Further, specifications may not be clear after the description has been appropriately crafted, leading to poor responses.It is also important that the evaluation criteria is very clear, since it forms the basis of every procurement decision.Issues that are critical to the buying organisation need to be clear in the mind of potential suppliers and this can be done by means of the emphasis expressed or the scores given to such requirements.At the end of the day, effectiveness in procurement is only enhanced where staff is capacitated.Procurement staff need knowledge and skills to tackle specific issues that are not provided by the academic and professional qualifications in procurement. Skills development, therefore, become a necessity.Nyasha Chizu is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply writing in his personal capacity.
