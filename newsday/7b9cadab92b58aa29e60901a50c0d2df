ARTISANAL miners in Shurugwi have called on government to set up a financial institution to specifically cater for players in the mining sector. by Obey ManayitiSpeaking during public consultations on the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill yesterday, the small-scale miners said the bank would go a long way in providing funding to the sector and help it grow.The consultations are being held by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mines to gather public views on proposals to amend the Mines and Minerals Act. We have a number of small-scale miners who are contributing immensely to the mining sector. However, we have seen that there is no political will on the part of government to empower this cluster. We need a mining bank that can capitalise our operations, mainly buying equipment and paying employees, small-scale miner Robert Antonio said. Banks and other micro-finance institutions are not favourable to small-scale miners. The bank should also have experienced people willing to grow this sector, he added.Other miners said the law should penalise prospective miners who hold onto to claims for speculative purposes.Others said the Bill must make it mandatory for miners to plough back into the community and encourage value addition.Some said the new regulations should make it mandatory to commission a baseline study focusing on mining fees that should be paid at different levels of mining and gazette prices that minerals should cost as unscrupulous middlemen were ripping them off.The Bill seeks to establish a Mines Affairs Board and residents said appointment to the board must be fair and all inclusive to promote transparency in the sector.
