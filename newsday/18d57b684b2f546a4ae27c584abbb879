THE third edition of the Midlands Music Awards (MMAs) ceremony scheduled for Friday this week is expected to live up to its billing, with a live broadcast from the YaFM, a local radio station in Zvishavane. BY NICOLA GIBSONThe event, scheduled for the Cathedral Hall in Gweru, will see performances from artistes including Samkoko, Brandon Mvura and Olinda Marowa. The radio station (YaFM) will cover a live broadcast from the venue for two hours 30 minutes, the awards vice-president Mavis Koslek said. The preparations for the MMAs are at an advanced stage with artists confirming their participation. This year, we have a red carpet and bigger event. We honour our musicians by giving them this platform. We have had our challenges, but we are back on track. The awards are on and what we have done is to create a platform for artistes that are born and bred in Midlands province to register with us. It is not forced. We are willing to assist, so they register to become a member. She said after the artistes had registered with them, they were then expected to submit their materials for adjudication, adding that new music only would be accepted. The music will be then collected and taken to the Midlands Music Awards, where we select professional musicians who adjudicate each and every material album submitted to us by the artiste, Koslek said. The album will then reach a certain percentage to become a nominee. Once it has passed, we take the nominee into our voting system. We have created a Facebook page for people to vote for their best nominees in different categories.
