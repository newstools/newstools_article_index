DYNAMOS coach Lloyd Mutasa and his assistant Murape Murape (pictured) will stay put at the Glamour Boys for the remainder of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League campaign following a meeting between club president Keni Mubaiwa and influential board chairperson Bernard Marriot on Monday. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAThe two principal figures at Dynamos had fallen out following the reversal by Marriot of Mubaiwa s decision to part ways with the two coaches.Mutasa had been dismissed for poor results, while Murape had been told to leave the club over comments he made in an interview with NewsDaySport suggesting, among other things, that the poor results were a result of a bad pre-season. Mutasa was initially told to continue in his post as the club searched for a new coach, preferably foreign, but barely 24 hours after Mubaiwa s announcement, Murape was back on the Dynamos bench after Marriot vetoed the decisions to fire the two.Mubaiwa felt undermined when his decision was overruled and threatened to quit his post.However, the pair buried their differences during their meeting on Monday, with sources saying they agreed to let the coaches continue in their jobs for the remainder of the campaign.The sources also said chances were still high that Mutasa could even lead the Harare giants next term given that the team had made a marked improvement since he took over from Portuguese coach Paulo Gorge Silva.They agreed that changing of coaches was destabilising the team and Mutasa deserved more time.The sources, however, said in the event that they decided to bring in a new coach next term, Mutasa and his assistant Murape would still be retained in the set-up. The two gentlemen agreed that the coaches should continue for the rest of the campaign, the source said. They agreed any changes now would destabilise the team and that they would review the situation at the end of the campaign. But from their discussions, Mutasa could be given another chance to lead the team next term. In the event that a new coach is brought in, the coaches are likely to be retained in the set-up. Mubaiwa had said he wanted to engage a new coach and had started negotiations with some foreign coaches.Dynamos in fifth place on the league table with 38 points, 13 behind leaders FC Platinum with five matches left in the campaign are all, but out of the championship race. They will finish the season empty-handed after exiting the Chibuku Super Cup in the first round following a defeat to How Mine last month.They host Hwange in a league match on Sunday.
