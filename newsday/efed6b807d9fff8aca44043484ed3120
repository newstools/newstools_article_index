Tourism and Hospitality Industry minister Walter Mzembi has implored investors to invest and help upgrade tourism facilities in the Midland province. BY REJOICE CHINGWARUSpeaking at the belated World Tourism Day Celebrations held in Kwekwe last week, Mzembi said the province had potential waiting to be explored. We have seen the potential in the Midlands province in terms of tourism and we want to explore it. It has the potential, in terms of mining tourism, religious tourism and other areas, and we are calling on investors to invest in order to unleash the full potential of these facilities, he said in a speech read on his behalf by his deputy, Anastancia Ndhlovu.This year s celebrations were moved to Kwekwe as part of diversification and marketing of other places, as resorts such as Victoria Falls and Kariba have been over-marketed. Mzembi said tourism players should work together to expand the sector and help to sustain the lives of those people surrounding the tourism facilities. We would like to encourage tourism players to unite and work together and we want tourism to be able to change the lives of people living in areas surrounding tourism facilities, he said.Mzembi said there was need for an upgrade of local tourism facilities, which was not accommodative to people living with disabilities. I urge the tourism industry to recognise that people with disabilities have equal right to tourism services and opportunities. If the tourism industry wants to maintain and develop quality, sustainability and competitiveness, it must support and develop tourism accessible for all for the benefit of everyone, he said.
