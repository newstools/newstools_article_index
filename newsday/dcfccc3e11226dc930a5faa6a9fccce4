ZIMBABWE forward Kuda Mahachi (pictured) has recovered from a broken arm and is expected to start training at his South African Premier Soccer League club Golden Arrows after the international break. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAWarriors team doctor Nick Munyonga said yesterday the Golden Arrows striker was recovering well and would start training with his teammates after the international break next week. Kuda is recovering very well. He has been going to the gym and working with a physiotherapist. But I have been in touch with the team s doctor and he will start training next week on October 16, said Munyonga.The Warriors star broke his right arm after landing awkwardly at training in a tussle for the ball with Maritzburg defender Blessing Moyo ahead of the trip to Guinea for Zimbabwe s final Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier on August 31.The former Chicken Inn attacker was operated on two days later in South Africa. His recovery comes at a time the Warriors are expected to start preparations for the Afcon finals in Gabon in January.Zifa have officially written to Zambia, Egypt and Ivory Coast proposing international friendly matches during the last Fifa international window of the year in November. Next month s international window is the last one before the Afcon to be staged between January and February next year.The soccer-controlling body failed to organise a match for the Warriors in this weekend s international window. This weekend has been set aside for the Fifa 2018 World Cup qualifiers, but the Warriors, who were kicked out of the qualifiers for failure to pay former coach Brazilian Valinhos his dues, will be inactive. The Warriors proposed opponents will also be occupied with the 2018 World Cup qualifiers next month.This is likely to see the Warriors engage football minnows that are not involved in the qualifiers, or Togo, who have also qualified for the Gabon tournament, but are out of the World Cup qualifiers.
