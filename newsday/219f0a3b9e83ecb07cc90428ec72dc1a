MULTIPLE award-winning songwriter and musician, Ammara Brown, yesterday said she matured as a musician after applying professionalism in her work and charting her own course on the local music scene. BY LORRAINE MUROMOAmmara told NewsDay following the release of her new single, Owami, on ETV last Saturday, as well as Wachu Want, that she was happy with the reception of the new tracks. Being professional is an attitude I ve maintained while constantly developing into a better version of my true self. As a result I own my own space in the industry, my own lane, she said. This has earned me the respect of my male peers in the industry. That, combined with a good team, more monetary investment and better strategies have made me a force to be reckoned with. She said Owami, a collaborative effort with several South African musicians, had received an overwhelming response from fans. It is Coke Studio collaboration between myself, Zinhle Ngidi, Sizwe Ngubane and produced by Top SA DJ, Mobi Dixon. It s getting great response from my Ammartians. I am very happy, she said. My new single, Wachu Want, featuring Chengeto, has also received overwhelming response from the public amassing 16 000 online plays in its first 24 hours. She said the video for Wachu Want, produced by Oskid, would be shot later this month. Meanwhile, Ammara refused to comment on suggestions that Mukoko, the hit track by Tytan in which she features, was a sexually-charged track given the wordplay and suggestive dances accompanying the video.
