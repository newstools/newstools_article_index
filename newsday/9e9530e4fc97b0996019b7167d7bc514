AFTER launching his 10th studio album, The Man-U-Script, in Bulawayo on Friday night, talented song writer, singer and producer Sanii Makhalima said there will be no launch in Harare for his latest release due to financial constraints. BY SINDISO DUBE I am happy to have come to Bulawayo and presented my latest album to my fans here. I will launch in other towns as we continue to share the new music on every corner of the country, he said. Unfortunately there will be no Harare launch as my budget is very tight. Doing an album launch in Harare is very hard. Everyone will be looking at you in anticipation of big things and if you pull a low-budget project, the media sometimes won t be friendly towards your launch and are quick to criticise. The 10-track album was launched at Club Eden where the artiste also gave away free CDs and performed songs from the latest album as well as some of his yesteryear hits.The album carries tracks such as I Surrender, Unodei featuring Andy Muridzo and Wakanditi Hauchandidi featuring Trevor Dongo and hip-hop artiste Takura.Wakanditi Hauchandidi became an instant crowd favourite as the singer delivered it to the fans.The artiste said the album is centred on his life and the situations he has faced in his life. The Man-U-Script is all about my life. I unpack my life experiences and what they have made me. I am narrating on how I grew up, my musical journey and how I have interacted with people in life, problems and relationships. It s about how all these interactions have nurtured me thus the concept, The Man-U-Script, Makhalima said. I Surrender is doing well on the Power FM weekly top 40 charts.With two decades in the music industry Makhalima has released a series of hits such as Usadaro, Ndofefeterwa, Hakuna Mumwe and Ndipe Rudo.
