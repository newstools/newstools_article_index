An examination of the existing political and economic situation prevailing in Zimbabwe seems to suggest that corruption is crippling the running of the country and this has led to the suffering of many people. The sprouting of many political parties indicates that people want power and influence in order for them to accumulate wealth. By Concerned ZimboHigher Education minister Jonathan MoyoHigher and Tertiary Education minister Jonathan Moyo and his deputy, Godfrey Gandawa allegedly used their influence to illegally channel the scarce resources to unintended beneficiaries.There is no simple accepted definition of corruption because what may seem corrupt in one society may not necessarily be perceived as such in another.Moyo has drawn brickbats from students unions from the Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund (Zimdef) for siphoning $270 000, yet getting a pat and a hero s welcome from the people in his constituency.The most commonly used and popular definition of corruption is that it is the use of public office for private advantage. In the ongoing investigations instituted by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc), Moyo used Zimdef funds to develop his constituency and Zanu PF programmes in order to fortify his position. It is high time that we should raise concern about the fallout in government-run institutions.It is high time that we should urge Zacc to advise Moyo to fully co-operate with it in order to bring this matter to finality, as soon as possible, as many people are interpreting it in different ways.The presumption of innocence until proven guilty remains a sacrosanct principle of our law, and Zanu PF has full confidence in our judiciary to act as final arbiters in these matters.It is, therefore, prudent for all of us to call for all people to desist from public comments that would undermine due process and create further confusion.Moyo sees himself as the proverbial sacred cow, hence, he is now spilling the beans in order to clear himself. A few years ago, Moyo was quoted saying people who misused public funds should be held accountable, now it is his turn and he is now crying foul.It is right and proper to urge all parties, as well as external stakeholders to allow the law to take its course.We should take heed of Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa s words that everyone, including Cabinet ministers and Vice-Presidents, can be prosecuted if there are reasonable grounds to suspect the commission of the crime as they are not above the law.We should unite and fight against corruption, as it is the root cause of all the problems bedevilling the country.We should also respect and give credit to Zacc, as it is a State arm mandated with investigating and dealing with cases of corruption.
