MUTASA South MP Trevor Saruwaka says his rights to religious freedom were infringed when he was chucked out of Parliament building during the official opening of the Fourth Session of the Eighth Parliament. BY VENERANDA LANGAMutasa South MP Trevor SaruwakaSaruwaka, a Rastafarian, was refused entry into Parliament when he appeared wearing in a multi-coloured fashion jacket with colours associated with both the Zimbabwean flag and that of Rastafarians.He attempted to enter Parliament building from the Kwame Nkrumah Avenue entrance clad in the jacket, but was turned away by security personnel. The colours I was wearing take a meaning in my Rastafarian faith and I feel prejudiced and discriminated, Saruwaka told NewsDay in an interview. My faith is deeply grounded in pan-Africanism, and on a day with a lot of importance like the official opening of the Fourth Session of the Eighth Parliament a day important to the development of our country through a presentation to the people s representatives, I felt one ought to be allowed to dress to their best comfort. The MP said he had also chosen to wear the multi-coloured Zimbabwean flag jacket because he believed it ushered blessings on him. In the Bible, Joseph had his coat of many colours which was a blessed jacket, Saruwaka said.In June, Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda ruled that national flags would not be allowed in the House after flag euphoria. A number of MDC-T MPs including Saruwaka had entered the House with the national flag draped on their necks as scarfs.The opposition MPs claimed it was a show of patriotism, but Mudenda banned the practice.The national flag has became a symbol of making a social statement on mis-governance, corruption and economic hardships experienced by Zimbabweans and was popularised by cleric Evan Mawarire of #ThisFlag movement.Meanwhile, in an unrelated matter, a pressure group, Zimbabwe Reveal for Generations Trust, has petitioned Parliament demanding urgent operationalisation of the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission in order to deal with past atrocities.In a statement, the Trust director Eddington Makono Mugova said there were atrocities, abductions, torture of inmates, and violent destruction of properties happening in the country which calls on the need for the commission to start its work. We need a committee of Parliament to look on fairness in distribution of agricultural inputs and food distribution in rural areas in a transparent manner. Food is being distributed on partisan basis where Zanu PF supporters are the only beneficiaries, Mugova said.
