Batsmen Vusi Sibanda, Regis Chakabva and Tino Mawoyo have both missed out on central contracts with Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC). by Kevin MapasureMost of the players on the central contracts list have already signed new deals with ZC, but a few players that include seamers Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara and batsman Prince Masvaure still have fitness issues that have delayed the signing of new contracts.Panyangara missed the India limited-overs India as well as the Test series against New Zealand which were played in Harare and Bulawayo, respectively, this year.Chatara, on the other hand, missed the New Zealand series, while Prince Masvaure played.They are also expected to sign their contracts once the fitness issues are ironed out, but there is nothing on the table for Sibanda and Mawoyo.For Sibanda it is likely that he has just fallen out of favour with the selectors, while Mawoyo, who has been plagued by injuries for a long period may need to prove himself this year before he can be rewarded in future.A total of 16 players are set to get central contracts.National team regulars and former skippers Elton Chigumbura and Hamilton Masakadza were offered new deals as was current captain Graeme Cremer, Sean Williams and Craig Ervine. Batsman Peter Moor, who scored his first Test half century against New Zealand August won himself a deal, while Malcolm Waller also clinched one.The players continued with preparations for the Sri Lanka series after ending their protest over contracts and outstanding match fees on Monday.Central contracts list: Graeme Cremer, Elton Chigumbura, Sikandar Raza Butt, Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara, Richmond Mutumbami, Donald Tiripano, Neville Madziva, Prince Masvaure, Wellington Masakadza, Malcolm Waller and Peter Moor.
