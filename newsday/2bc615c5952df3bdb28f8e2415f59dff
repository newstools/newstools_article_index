DATATA Primary School in Gwanda recently received a shot in the arm after community members joined hands with a local Christian group, Habakkuk Trust, to construct a classroom block. BY KHANYILE MLOTSHWAThe school, located in Gwanda district s ward 2, is facing an acute shortage of classrooms, with all pupils from early childhood development to Grade 7 cramped in two classroom blocks.Dickson Dube, a member of Habakkuk Trust in the ward, said community members contributed more than $2 000 for the project. Over $2 000 was contributed by the community and the rest of the money came from the school development levy, he said. The trusses were bought last month and have since been delivered. A businessperson pledged to donate roofing sheets for the whole structure and we are hoping by the time the rains start, we would have completed the roofing. Dube said in the midst of battling socio-economic challenges, the majority of the community members managed to contribute $10 per household for the roofing material. At the moment, pupils are learning seated back-to-back, which has compromised the quality of learning and has resulted in poor performance in most cases, he said.
