After losing the first of five one-day internationals against visiting Pakistan A, Zimbabwe A will look to bounce back when the two teams clash in the second cricket match at Harare Sports Club this morning. BY SPORTS REPORTER Zim A captain Malcolm Waller will demand a better show with the bat from his side in their match against Pakistan A todayPakistan A, who only arrived in Harare the day before the first match, recorded a six-wicket win, which was inspired by Umar Amin whose 122-ball knock produced 86 runs as his side ran out Zim A s total of 197.The visitors completed the win with 30 balls to spare and the hosts would have been disappointed with their show in their own conditions.Zim A, fielding a side with Test experience, will be looking to improve on their batting where their top batsmen got the starts in the first match, but failed to kick on.Opening batsmen Vusi Sibanda and Brian Chari fell for 22 and 26, but it was Tarisai Musakanda, batting at number three, who was the pick of the crop for the hosts with 56 runs.Regis Chakabva, who will be looking at using this series to regain a place in the national side, managed just 16 runs while Malcolm Waller, who captains the side, made nine.Wicketkeeper/batsman Richmond Mutumbami didn t do well either scoring just six runs, but Sikandar Raza justified his experience with 40 runs from 72 balls.Zim A also have former national team captain Elton Chigumbura in reserve and they can call upon his hard hitting which could give the team a better chance of restoring parity in the series.Chigumbura will be desperate to face some deliveries having missed the Test series against New Zealand in July and August.National team players in the side will be looking to warm up for the Test series coming up against Sri Lanka before the triangular series involving the same nation and West Indies.On the bowling side, Zimbabwe picked up four wickets, but both Neville Madziva and Tendai Chatara were not successful in that regard and will be desperate for success in the second match today.
