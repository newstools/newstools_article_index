BY LORRAINE MUROMOLeonard Karikoga ZhakataIn a statement released by the musician s camp, they said the track which also features Sulumani Chimbetu and Progress Chipfumo off his latest Mutunga Dzese album, has cemented his position as a top musician. The track has also received backing from other songs on the album that have been doing incredibly, well especially Zvine Mwaka, which has bagged 10187 votes, the statement read in part. The voting patterns prove Zhakata is among the country s top five musicians, contrary to speculative thinking by some armchair critics who seem to be hell-bent on pulling Zhakata down. The camp claimed that no song has ever amassed as much votes in a single week, adding that Zhakata s strength lay in his message that identifies with listeners situations. Madam Boss is a song which speaks of a strikingly beautiful and powerful woman described as a cash controller , with suggestive dance skills on stage.Since the release of his album the, musician has toured Banket, Beitbridge, Chegutu, Chivhu, Glendale, Guruve, Kadoma, Kwekwe, Mabvuku Marondera, Masvingo, Mvurwi, Mt Darwin, Mutoko, Nyamapanda, Shamva and Shurugwi.Zhakata rose to fame in 1994 following the release of the hit song, Mugove, off the album Maruva Enyika, which became like a street anthem. He broke new ground in the music industry by becoming the youngest and the first Zimbabwean solo musician to sell over 100 000 copies of an album after selling over 120 000 copies of Maruva Enyika.
