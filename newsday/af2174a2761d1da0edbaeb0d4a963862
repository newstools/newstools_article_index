RISING gospel musician Daniel Mhere has penned a song dedicated to the national soccer team, the Warriors, after its recent qualification for the next edition of the Orange Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals to be held early next year in Gabon. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA Daniel MhereAccording to Mhere, the five-minute track, Tambai Bhora Vakomana, was meant to support the national team, who are the only southern African country to participate in the prestigious continental tournament finals.The musician, who is an older brother to gospel sensation Mathias Mhere, said he soon would begin working on the video to accompany the song. The song is about supporting our national team. Our Warriors are going on an expedition representing the country, something that needs to be honoured. The Warriors will not only be representing Zimbabwe, but the whole of the southern Africa since we are the only country from this region, he said. This is not a gospel track. I am trying my best that by the time the Warriors leave for the tournament, I would have done the video for the song. Meanwhile, the elder brother, Mathias, recently scooped an award during the Midlands Gospel Awards (MDA) held at The Cathedral in Gweru. He won in the Best Traditional Gospel during the event that is meant to honour artistes from the Midlands province.Last year, the Favour singer scooped two awards at the same event.Other notables, who won on the same night, were Olinda Marowa (Best Contemporary, Gospel), Hazvinei DJ Chilli Sakarombe (Best Radio Personality) and Oskid (Best Producer).
