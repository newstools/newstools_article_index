Those outside Harare can collect the forms from our official website, www.zimhiphopawards.co.zw. Submissions of will then start on September 15 up to October 25 through our hip hop shop or the online platform. This year s awards will see a few changes and additions to the categories from the usual 21. This year we will add two more categories, firstly, best hip-hop hustle given to any individual that has worked hard in their respective fields to contribute to the growth of the hip hop culture as a genre or business, be it an artiste, dancer, manager or designer. We also have best verse which will be awarded to an individual who will pull an outstanding verse or a line on a song this year, Nyandoro said. The venue, he said, would be announced soon.Work to be considered for nomination this year should fall within the stipulated time range of November 2015 to October 2016. Last year s awards were held at Harare s Club 1+1 and saw Bulawayo rapper Cal_vin winning big-best male, best album and best song, whilst Ti Gonzi walked away with best collaboration and best freestyle. The Zim Hip-Hop Awards Company recently opened a shop named Classic Hip-Hop Store in Harare s central business district which will distribute local music, local fashion designs, offer consultancy to artistes and also help with funding.
