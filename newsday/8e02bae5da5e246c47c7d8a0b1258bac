OPPOSITION Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) leader, Joice Mujuru, takes her campaign trail to Beitbridge this weekend after rounding up her international diplomatic offensive, which saw her address rallies in South Africa and the United Kingdom. BY OWN CORRESPONDENTThe rally will be held at Dulivhadzimu Stadium on Saturday.Mujuru is likely to use the event to vent her anger against implementation of Statutory Instrument 64/2016, which effectively banned importation of certain basic commodities, which had become a source of livelihood for the majority of Beitbridge residents, who survived on vending.At her Masvingo rally in July, Mujuru cited Beitbridge as one of the places where people had expressed concern about bad policies. The riots in Beitbridge were because government did not consult the people before coming up with such a policy. You do not start by throwing a policy to the people. There was need to explain to the people. People are now clever. They think and analyse. Let us not lie to people, she said. How can you limit importation of basic foodstuffs yet some people have extended families and may need more quantities than what you allow in the country? Now they are asking where the industries are that you want to protect. On July 1 this year, residents went berserk and destroyed government property at Beitbridge Border Post, as they protested against implementation of the statutory instrument.A Zimbabwe Revenue Authority warehouse, council vehicles and traffic lights were destroyed, while some shops were looted in the demonstrations that later spread throughout the country. Mujuru has since challenged the introduction of SI64/2016 and the matter still pending in court.
