DYNAMOS board of directors chairperson Bernard Marriot and club president Keni Mubaiwa finally found each other following a meeting held in Harare yesterday to try and bring sanity to the Harare football giants. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAThe Glamour Boys had been left leaderless with treasurer Webster Marechera the only executive member of the club, after a fallout between Mubaiwa and Marriot the most powerful member of the board.Mubaiwa had taken a back seat and threatened to resign over a decision by the board to reinstate assistant coach Murape Murape, whom he had fired two weeks ago. He felt undermined.On Friday, the administrator told NewsDay Sport that he had made up his mind on stepping down and would not reverse the decision no matter what persuasion. But after their meeting yesterday, it is understood they reached common ground and agreed to continue working together.Mubaiwa confirmed the meeting with Marriot, but referred questions to Marriot. Yes, we met, but we agreed that Marriot will issue a Press statement on the resolutions. That is what we agreed, so you can talk to him, Mubaiwa said.Marriot could not be reached for comment.Murape was fired following comments he made in an interview with NewsDay Sport where he suggested that Dynamos lacked quality players and that a bad pre-season was the reason the team had struggled to mount a serious title challenge this season.Coach Lloyd Mutasa was also told that he would leave his job over poor results.Dynamos are set to complete a barren season after exiting the Chibuku Super Cup in the first round last month.Meanwhile, the draw for the semi-finals of the Chibuku Super Cup will be conducted today.Defending champions Harare City, FC Platinum, Ngezi Platinum and Highlanders are the remaining teams. For the draw, there would be no seeded teams and teams will be paired by drawing lots. The first team drawn from the pot shall be paired against the third team drawn and the second team drawn shall be paired against the fourth team drawn.The semi-finals have been scheduled for October 22-23 with the final set for November 5.The organisers of the tournament said venues would be announced in due course.
