Home side ZPC Kariba held Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title contenders Caps United in what is probably the most exciting scoreless matches in the topflight this season. by Dennis Kagonye in Kariba The fans who thronged Nyamhunga Stadium were treated to enthralling entertainment as the two sides fought for full marks.ZPC Kariba dominated the first half, where they were let down by poor finishing from Talent Chawapihwa, and could also have scored through former Caps United stars Tawanda Munyaduri and Tawanda Nyamandwe, who both fluffed good opportunities.On the other hand, Caps United controlled the majority of the second half with Dominic Chungwa missing probably their best chance in that period, having been denied by goalkeeper Tafadzwa Mawaya in the first half.Chawapihwa could have won it for the home side later on, but he also fluffed his lines.Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe expressed satisfaction with the draw and the performance by his team. I am pleased with the way my players showed character in this match coming from the disappointment of getting knocked out of the cup competition at the weekend, he said. I am happy with a point gained away from home against such a tough opponent. On the other hand, Sunday Chidzambwa was also pleased with the draw although he felt that had his players, particularly Chawapihwa, been more clinical in front of goal, they would have won the match.The draw, coupled with that of table toppers FC Platinum against Border Strikers, opens up a window of opportunity for Highlanders to capitalise and reduce the gap between them and their rivals when they take on Harare City at Rufaro Stadium this afternoon.
