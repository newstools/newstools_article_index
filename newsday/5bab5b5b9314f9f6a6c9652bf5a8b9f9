BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAYesterday Zifa, through spokesperson, Xolisani Gwesela, said that they had engaged Zambia, Ivory Coast and Egypt to try and secure an international friendly for the team next month. We have written to Egypt, Ivory Coast and Zambia for possible international friendlies, he said. Negotiations are still ongoing and we hope to secure a friendly with any of these teams for the next international break in November. We are also still talking to Nigeria and we will have a clear picture by next week. We want to ensure that the Warriors are well-prepared for the Gabon tournament. Next month s international window is the last one before the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) to be staged in Gabon between January and February next year.The football supreme body failed to organise a match for the Warriors in this weekend s international window.This weekend is set aside for the Fifa 2018 World Cup qualifiers and the Warriors, who were kicked out of the qualifiers for failure to pay former coach, Brazilian Valinhos his dues, will be inactive.The technical team led by Kalisto Pasuwa had requested friendly matches against opponents from West Africa.The Warriors proposed opponents will be involved in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers next month, with Egypt hosting Ghana, while Ivory Coast will be travelling to Morocco.Zambia are on the road to Cameroon and that could complicate the issue. They could, however, engage football minnows, who are not involved in the qualifiers, or Togo, who have also qualified for Afcon 2017.Togo played an international friendly with Uganda on Tuesday and have another match against Mozambique in Maputo on Sunday. The Warriors qualified for the Afcon finals for the first time in 10 years after finishing top in Group L, which also contained Swaziland, Guinea and Malawi.They were placed in the last pot for the draw that will be conducted in Libreville on October 19.
