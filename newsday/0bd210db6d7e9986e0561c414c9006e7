JAH Prayzah fans in Marondera are looking forward to a treat this week as they will get a chance to interact with their idol as he brings the Mdhara Achauya craze to the sleepy farming town in a show dubbed Marondera s First Ever Family Show . BY JAIROS SAUNYAMAThe gig, scheduled for Rudhaka Stadium, will see the lanky musician sharing the stage with Zimdancehall sensation, Freeman, and Pengaudzoke, fronted by Faheem Somanje.Show organiser, Daniel Masaiti said the decision to host the family show followed calls by the town s residents who wanted their children to watch Jah Prayzah performing live. For the past two years, I have been getting calls from parents, mainly mothers, asking me to bring Jah Prayzah to Marondera for a family show so that they can bring their children to witness their role model performing live, he said. It has been long since this town has hosted a family show, let alone bringing Jah. This is why the show is dubbed First Ever Family Show. He said he opted for Rudhaka Stadium because it was more spacious and could accommodate more people, compared to other local venues, as he was expecting a huge turnout. We will have people travelling from as far as Macheke and Masomera and there is need for space for children and parents. All the musicians participating on Sunday are crowd pullers, he said.
