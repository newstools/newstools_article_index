(2) 2Triangle ended a four-match losing run in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League with an important away win against Bulawayo City at Barbourfields Stadium yesterday. BY FORTUNE MBELEThe victory brought with it relief for coach David Mandigora, who was under pressure with his job under threat.Junior Chirambamuriwo and Hardlife Mavundi scored for the Sugar Sugar Boys inside three minutes in the 29th and 32nd minutes.Bulawayo City, who got their consolation two minutes after the break via Mkhokeli Dube, dominated the second half, but could not get the goals.After yesterday s win, Mandigora was left convinced that his side was back on track in their quest to finish among the top-four teams on the league table. I am relieved because we had not won in the last four matches. I am very happy for the boys; they worked hard. Getting three points away from home is a good sign that we are back on track. We just want to end the season in a respectable position and that s a top-four finish, Mandigora said.A well-timed substitution, where Lameck Nhamo replaced Simba Makoni in the 26th minute, made a difference for the travelling side with goals coming almost soon after the change.Bulawayo City coach Try Ncube was displeased with his team s performance and the outcome of the match. We are disappointed.
