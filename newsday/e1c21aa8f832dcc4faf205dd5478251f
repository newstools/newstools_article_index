We are delighted to have this important match against Egypt and I am sure it will help us to assess our players preparedness ahead of the AWC, Mlauzi told the Zifa website.The technical team retained the core of the Olympic squad as they seek continuity and consistency before the continental showpiece.Skipper Felistas Muzongondi and Rudo Neshamba are among the few players who have been dropped for the preparatory match due to injury. We have dropped Rudo [Neshamba] and Felistas [Muzongondi] because of chronic injuries. We remain grateful for the girls sacrifice during the Olympic games and the Affrica Women Cup of Nations qualifiers, therefore, they will be considered for selection once they have recuperated, Mlauzi added.Seeking to bolster his squad, Mlauzi has broadened his selection pool by calling up American based Palesa Chipendo and England based Moddy Muwoni, who are both midfielders.
