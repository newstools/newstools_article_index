POLICE indiscriminately bashed some revellers, who were left injured, as they tried to gain entry to the last show of Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo on Saturday at the Large City Hall in Bulawayo. BY SINDISO DUBEThe trouble, which was witnessed by NewsDay, ensued when fans started pushing their way into the venue, complaining of having been made to stand for long hours on end in the queue.This was after only one entrance was used by the organisers for use by both the fans and the artistes. The police then relentlessly bludgeoned the helpless fans after they started demanding answers on why they had been made to stand in the long winding queue.The police did not only use the truncheons, but also sprayed the revellers with pepper spray, as they tried to restore order. The spray left revellers coughing and scratching their itchy eyes.Some of the victims, who seemed to have been affected, could be seen lying on the ground.When contacted for comment, Bulawayo police spokesperson, Inspector Precious Simango said she was in Harare and could not comment on the matter.The festival spokesperson, Nkululeko Nkala defended the police s actions. The police were trying to maintain order at the venue, since people wanted to gain access violently, which could have caused more problems. We thank them (police) for their work at the festival this year, not as a service provider, but partners, he said.One fan, who identified himself as Sibusiso Ncube, said the promoters might have underestimated the attendance. I think the promoters might have underestimated the numbers that would come for such an event. They should have opened more entry points with the artistes using a separate gate from the fans and this disorder could have been avoided, he said.Away from the violent skirmishes, the concert, which was well-attended, saw several local artistes, among them Ramsey K, Mzoe 7, Leeknotic, Sandra Ndebele and DJ Mzoe, showcasing their talent to an appreciative crowd.
