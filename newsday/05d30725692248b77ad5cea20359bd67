AN Islamic humanitarian organisation, Universal Peace Federation (UPF), has claimed that economic sanctions imposed on the Zanu PF government by Western countries, were stifling transfer of financial aid to local orphanages. BY MUNESU NYAKUDYAUPF founder, Musa Menk made the claims in Harare recently, while addressing delegates during commemorations of the Day of Peace organised by the Zimbabwe United Nations Association.Menk said a lot of needy Zimbabweans were failing to access financial aid from Islamic states because of sanctions. Orphans are suffering in Zimbabwe because of sanctions. When my country says let us send money to Zimbabwe to those whom we would have identified that they need help, the bank will then say no because of sanctions, he said. I, therefore, say sanctions disturb peace in any country if money cannot be transferred easily because of them. In a separate interview with NewsDay at the same function, Parliamentary Thematic Committee on Peace and Security chairperson, Senator Damian Mumvuri claimed that Zimbabwe is a peaceful country despite the recent violent protests experienced in major cities. Generally, Zimbabwe is a peaceful nation and we have a peaceful people. What has been going on is a temporary measure that can be passed. There are issues that must be resolved and the responsible authorities should be expansive and if that is done, we will continue as a peaceful nation, he added.Commenting on the theme of the day, Building Blocks for Peace, Mumvuri said in order for meaningful development to take place in the country, there was need for peace.Harare Provincial Affairs minister Miriam Chikukwa in her speech said: The modern challenges of poverty, hunger, diminishing natural resources, including water, social inequality, environmental degradation, diseases, corruption, racism and xenophobia, among others, pose serious challenges to peace and stability and can create fertile grounds for conflict.
