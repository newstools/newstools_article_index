AGRO-processing firm, National Foods Holdings, says efficiency at its Bulawayo factory is now 70% up after the upgrading of its manufacturing equipment. BY MTHANDAZO NYONIIn an interview with NewsDay, National Foods Stockfeeds managing executive, Lewis Ngwenya said in the last two years, they have been upgrading their manufacturing plant in Bulawayo to improve efficiency.Ngwenya said they spent more than $200 000 on new packaging equipment to recapitalise their stockfeed business. Since we have put up new equipment, we have seen that our through-put into the factory has gone up, he said. We have moved from six metric tonnes to 10 metric tonne per hour on each line and that gives us 60 to 70% efficiency improvement on it. It has improved the efficiency of doing stockfeed business. We are almost there, he said. Ngwenya recently told NewsDay that they were seeking to increase exports of stock feeds to the Botswana Meat Commission by more than 43% a month after the Botswana company said it will increase its off-take from them.The division was last week given an ISO 9001 certificate by the Standards Association of Zimbabwe.
