CHIVI Rural District Council (RDC) chairperson, Killer Zivhu, has launched a watermelon project meant to economically empower over 500 households in the drought-prone Chivi South district. By Tatenda ChitaguZivhu also donated four tonnes of 10kg mealie-meal to women in the area, as well as containers for fetching water to irrigate their nutrition gardens.He also launched a pilot project at his rural homestead on a plot that spans over two hectares.Speaking at the launch of the project at his rural homestead yesterday, Zivhu, also president of the Association of Rural District Councils, said the watermelon project was suitable in the arid district for villagers to raise income before the onset of the rains. While I periodically give people foodstuffs, it is not sustainable to continue giving them 10kg bags of mealie-meal as this will create a dependency syndrome. I realised it is better to give them watermelon seeds and the know-how to grow them, as well as create a market for them so that they get income and improve food security at household level, he said.Zivhu said the project is set to avert hunger in the area as crops fail every year, leaving many villagers dependent on food handouts from the social welfare and non-governmental organisations. We expect each household to produce 1 500 watermelons and we create a market for them so they can have money for fees for their children as well as their upkeep, he said.Early this week Zivhu donated his monthly $230 allowance from the RDC to a 13-year-old cardiac patient Tawanda Shoko, from Mudadisi Village in Chivi North.He has also built several houses for orphans and child-headed families in Chivi.
