Anyone who thinks this could be a serious proposition is crazy. How on earth could a failed African leader have the audacity to propose that Africa deserves two permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council when there is only Botswana President Ian Khama who can run his country properly? By A.McCormick,Our ReaderPresident Robert MugabeMany African leaders are dictators and have no principles of justice, human rights, democracy or peaceful co-existence with their subjects. They always resort to violence against innocent citizens when their hold on power is challenged.They have reduced the continent into a flight zone as citizens flee economic mayhem or political violence. Their corruption levels know no bounds.There was a reward of $5 million offered to any African president who observed his constitution and stepped down peacefully and orderly after his term of office expired. The money was safe as the person making the offer must have known that all African leaders make much more than $5 million through corruption and would hang onto power to keep enriching themselves the good of their citizens or country never enters the equation.If President Robert Mugabe were to be the person elected to represent Africa, the first thing he would do is have the International Criminal Court disbanded as he did with the Sadc Tribunal not for the good of humanity, but to save his skin and that of all the other African leaders who have abused the human rights of their citizens. He would block any proposal put forward by the US or UK that would lead to world peace, not for the good of the world, but out of spite because they have sanctioned him for his lack of principles and dictatorial tendencies in ruling (ruining) Zimbabwe. How can he dare to lecture the world body on resolving conflicts peacefully whilst back home he is using the police and Zanu PF youths to beat up and instil fear in his subjects? It is bad enough for the world having such a person ruling a tinpot State like Zimbabwe, but it would be catastrophic for the world if he had veto power in the Security Council.
