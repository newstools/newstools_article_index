In response Mugabe attacks weaken State institutions: To put it simple, you do not think President Robert Mugabe should behave like every other human? By Mark Longhurst,Our ReaderPresident R.G.MugabeHe can make laws sympathetic to himself and be accountable to no one. Former Rhodesian Prime minister Ian Smith did not have the venom and hatred that Mugabe has. He has rewritten laws to suit an autocratic apartheid one party regime. He has presided over more orchestrated tribal atrocities (Gukurahundi) than most African leaders. Mugabe has willingly destroyed an industrial, agriculture and manufacturing sector by forcing a brain drain of about four million to the Diaspora. Every decent human being should be asking for him to face The Hague.
