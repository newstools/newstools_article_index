A GROUPING of opposition parties under the banner of National Electoral Reform Agenda (Nera) yesterday urged its members to brace for a fresh wave of demonstrations starting with Chitungwiza this Friday before spreading to other provinces next week. BY EVERSON MUSHAVANera s head of legal affairs, Douglas Mwonzora, said their meeting in the capital had resolved to intensify demands for electoral reforms through public demonstrations. We are going to hold a major rally in Chitungwiza this Friday and other parts of the country. Next Friday, we will hold mega demonstrations in the country&#8217;s 210 constituencies, Mwonzora said. We are simply going to notify the police, but will not be concerned with their response. We have notified them before and they still beat us, so we will go ahead with the protests. Police on Saturday crushed another Nera demonstration in Harare and arrested over 100 protesters.But Mwonzora said: We are not afraid of Mugabe s little prison cells. It s game on, adding they would also take their campaign to Sadc, the African Union and the international community.
