ZIFA have begun the search for a new chief executive officer to fill the void left by the departure of Jonathan Mashingaidze, whose contract expired in April. Sports ReporterThe Philip Chiyangwa-led board decided not to renew Mashingaidze s contract when it expired, choosing to look elsewhere. Zifa placed an advert on its website yesterday inviting applications from candidates interested in the post. The candidate, according to Zifa, should have at least 10 years experience and possess a commercial or sports management degree. The successful candidate will be based in Harare, reporting to the Zifa president and will be responsible for the implementation of decisions passed by the congress and the executive committee among other duties. Joseph Mamutse has been the federation s acting chief executive since Mashingaidze s departure.
