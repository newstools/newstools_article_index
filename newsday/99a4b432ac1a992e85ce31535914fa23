MARONDERA-based African Roots band have dedicated their victory in the Chibuku Road to Fame Mashonaland East finals held on Saturday at Tandarai Beer Gardens to their late drummer Gift Nickson, who was murdered at Rusike suburb last year. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO/JAIROS SAUNYAMAThe Dombotombo-based Afro-fusion group proved their mettle ahead of six other groups to walk away with a $1 000 cash prize for winners and the right to represent the province at the national finals, which will feature champions from the country s 10 provinces, set for September 24 at Glamis Stadium in Harare.The seven-member group, which was formed in 2010, has participated at the provincial finals five times and progressed to the national finals twice.Speaking to NewsDay, African Roots spokesperson Zivai Muchenagumbo said they dedicated their win to the late drummer, who was a pillar of strength to members of the group and always wanted the best for the band. Although this year s competition was tough, we are happy we managed to pull through and booked our ticket to the finals. We dedicate the victory to our former drummer Gift Nickson, who used to encourage us to do our best in all that we do both on and off the stage, Muchenagumbo said. Last year, Gift was disappointed when we lost at the finals and he failed to easily accept the defeat, that he recommended we work extra hard to return to the finals again and settle for the first position, upholding his words, we are going to the finals, but sadly will not be with him at as he wished. Muchenagumbo said their focus was now on preparations for the national finals, where he said they were aiming for a better position than last year. Our group has been facing financial challenges and instruments problems, but that will not deter us as we want to fight for a better position at the grand finals. It is a great honor to represent the province in such a prestigious event, he said.
