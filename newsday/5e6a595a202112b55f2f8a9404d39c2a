BY BUSINESS REPORTERIn a statement yesterday, Zimbabwe s trade development and promotion organisation, ZimTrade, said it would host an export awareness seminar on understanding trade agreements in Bulawayo tomorrow in a bid to create awareness and understanding of the various trade agreements to which Zimbabwe is a signatory to. Exporters would learn would learn from the seminar on how they could benefit from the agreements. It is imperative that local companies are fully aware of the various Trade Agreements available and the registration process as well as the benefits of being registered, ZimTrade said. The purpose of trade agreements is to stimulate trade between the signatory countries. This results in specific products being accorded preferential treatment on entry into the importing country. ZimTrade said preferential treatment means that the products would attract reduced or no customs duties in the importing country. Therefore, the exported products become competitive, it said. Zimbabwe is currently benefitting from bilateral trade agreements with Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique, Botswana and South Africa as well as the regional trade agreements (Sadc Trade Protocol and Comesa Free Trade Area). The country is also a member of the East and Southern African- European Union interim Economic Partnership Agreement, which provides preferential access for exports to the European Union. The seminar presents an opportunity for companies to understand the specific Rules of Origin for each Trade Agreement and the export products which are eligible for preferential treatment in duty payment, ZimTrade said.
