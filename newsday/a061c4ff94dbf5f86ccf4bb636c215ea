AN upcoming Zimbabwean poet based in South Africa, Karen Hozheri (21) has bemoaned the economic decay in her home country through a poignant poem titled Mamma It s Me. BY ARTS REPORTERThe Mufakose-born poet, who took up writing at a tender age, said she has always expressed herself through words and her poem aptly summed up how she felt about the situation in Zimbabwe. The poem, Mamma It s Me, is a dedication to my mother (who died in 2010) and speaks about the motherland Zimbabwe and the economic situation we are facing, she said.The vivacious poet paints a touching picture of the situation Zimbabwe finds itself in today. Mamma, it s me your sunshine, your sunflower. I know it hardly makes sense to say sunshine when lately the sun has scorched you old. To say sunflower when all you see is the withered flowers, one verse in the poem reads.The story of Zimbabweans living in the Diaspora was also captured in the poem, where the poet highlights to the mother that she had to leave because the breadbasket in the house had become a breeding ground for cockroaches.The erosion of bank savings, political intimidation and alienation are also captured in the poem, but the poet holds on to hope. Yes, we have not had it easy as Zimbabweans, but amidst all this suffering and the setbacks of the past 16 years, I believe all hope is not lost. I believe in a Zimbabwe that will provide free education for its people and a better economy, because these, among other challenges, are the reasons why more Zimbabweans continue to leave, she said. Hozheri said she has also started an initiative called My Sister s Keeper meant to assist disadvantaged girls. My prayer is to be established so that I can empower others. I have already started a movement called My Sister s Keeper , where I aid the girl child with clothing and hopefully will send one or two girls to school.
