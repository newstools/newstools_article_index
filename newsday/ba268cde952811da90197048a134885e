SowetanMshozaSpeaking about starting out in the industry as a teenager Mshoza says that her record label protected her from many things and even imposed rules on going out dating and drinking. Getting into the industry at 15 means that you get exposed to a lot of things that a 15-year- old doesn t know about. You become an adult at 15. We weren t allowed to date until 21. We weren t allowed to go to clubs she told Drum.Describing the first time she took drugs Mshoza says that she was made to do it. At some point, I met up with wrong people and, unfortunately, the first time when they made me try it I collapsed and ended up in hospital. So I tried it and it didn t work for me. I collapsed and it was all over the newspapers. In December 2011, Mshoza made headlines after a spokesperson for her husband at the time claimed that she had collapsed after taking a handful of pills.It was reported that she was in a coma and at the time, it was speculated that it was a suicide attempt.Since then, she has had to fight off rumours of wild nights involving drugs and booze. While Mshoza has previously slammed the speculation she did admit that she likes to drink a glass of wine. Yes I do drink my wine. I don t go out a lot. I only started drinking at age 23 or 22. I was not allowed until 21. After 21, I was told you are old enough and have to take care of yourself .
