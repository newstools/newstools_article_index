JOYOUS Celebration founder, Jabu Hlongwane, and another South African gospel musician, Sipho Makhabane, will headline Zimpraise s music summer festival set for Harare from October 6 to 8. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOSipho MakhabaneThe choir s chief executive officer, Joseph Madziyire, yesterday told NewsDay that bringing in Hlongwane, Makhabane and Hlengiwe Mhlaba for the festival confirmed the interdenominational choir s vision to unite people and spread the gospel through music. We have organised this festival with the purpose of bringing people together to celebrate Christ. People must come in their numbers to be entertained, ministered to and experience the power and Word of God through music, he said.Madziyire said the festival will open with a free-of-charge Gospel Fashion Night concert at Kingstone House in Harare under the theme, Fashion Meets the Church.Popular radio presenters Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa and Tich Mataz will host the show, set to be graced by fashionistas Cythia Bizure, Rutendo Denise, Kuda K7 and Thembani Mubochwa. Being moral does not mean one must be on the wrong side of fashion. So the Gospel Fashion Night show is a platform for Christians to converge to discuss fashion trends in the church, like the praise-and-worship team dressing, among other fashion issues, Madziyire said. The second day of the festival opens with music, praise and worship workshops at the same venue, featuring Hlongwane, Tamie Bimha, Madziyire, Makhabane and Shana, with the highlight of the day being the Heal Zimbabwe Prayer Night concert in Harare.Madziyire said the workshops were meant to empower locals and would address issues that include arts, media and music departments, audio visual, lifestyle of the praise and worshipper and careers in church. One of the objectives when Zimpraise was formed was to empower local churches and these free-of-charge workshops are designed to capacitate praise and worshippers in churches for them to be more effective in their churches and solo careers, he said.Madziyire said two of the choir s ambassadors, Sakhile Khanye from the United Kingdom and Praise Peterson from South Africa, would also grace the festival.He said the highlight of the closing day of the festival would be Zimpraise s Season 9 live DVD recording, to be shot under the theme Pentecostal-The Coming of The Holy Spirit.The tickets for the live DVD recording concert, which are available at all Chicken Slice outlets and all 4May fashion shops, are selling at $10 VIP, $5 general entry, while children will have to pay $3.Local performers at the concert will include Michael Mahendere, Bimha, Mathias Mhere, Pastor G, Wellington Kwenda, Sharon Manyonganise, Richard Dube and Kudakwashe Mutsvene.
