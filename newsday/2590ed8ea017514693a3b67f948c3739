ZPC Kariba coach Sunday Mhofu Chidzambwa has warned Harare giants Caps United that they will not get easy points when the two sides clash in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Nyamhunga Stadium this afternoon. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAChidzambwa whose side is in fourth place with 36 points and 11 points adrift of log leaders FC Platinum with seven matches before the end of the campaign has ruled his team out of the championship race, but still aims for a higher place on the table.Their target is to win all their remaining matches of the season.Chidzambwa, however, predicted a tough game against Caps United, who are trailing FC Platinum by one point as they seek to win their first championship since 2005 when they claimed back-to-back league titles under Charles Mhlauri. It will be a tough match for both teams. Caps United are fighting for the championship while we are fighting for a respectable position at the end of the season. We are trailing leaders FC Platinum by 11 points and we are out of the race. But I would love to win all our remaining matches and see what the future holds. Anything can happen in football. Caps United should, therefore, not expect to get points on a silver platte. They have to fight for it. It will not be easy, Chidzambwa said.ZPC Kariba have been in top form in the past five games in which they won three and drew two, while Caps United won three, lost one against Bulawayo City and drew another against HwangeCaps United have been boosted by the return of attackers Leonard Tsipa and Abbas Amidu, who missed the Chibuku Super Cup defeat to Tsholotsho last Saturday because of injuries.But midfielders Tafadzwa Rusike, Archieford Gutu and Chrispen Machisi remain sidelined as they are still nursing injuries.Caps United will be banking on Tsipa, who is the PSL leading scorer with nine goals. This season the striker has developed a knack for scoring key goals that have rescued matches for the team.Without his power and influence, the Green Machine have often struggled for penetration.In the reverse fixture at Rufaro Stadium, Caps United rallied from behind to secure a 2-2 draw with Tsipa scoring a beautiful leveller at the death after ZPC Kariba had raced into the lead through goals by Limited Chikafa and Talent Chawapiwa before Phineas Bhamusi pulled one back as the Green Machine clawed their way back into the game.In this match, Lloyd Chitembwe s team will be looking to put behind the the disappointment of getting knocked out of the Chibuku Super Cup in the first round.A season that has held so much promise can turn out to be a disappointing one after all, if Caps finish empty-handed.All the three teams in the championship race face tough fixtures in the league run-in and in this round of fixtures all of them are playing away from home.Highlanders are at Rufaro Stadium tomorrow where they take on Harare City while Norman Mapeza s FC Platinum visit Border Strikers this afternoon.Before any of the sides can think about their title rivals, they will need to do their own job and collect a full set of marks.Fixtures Tomorrow: Ngezi Platinum v Chapungu (Baobab), ZPC Kariba v Caps United (Nyamhunga), Border Strikers v FC Platinum (Dulivhadzimu), Bulawayo City v Triangle (Barbourfields), Dynamos v Tsholotsho (Rufaro) Thursday; Chicken Inn v Mutare City Rovers (White City), Harare City v Highlanders (Rufaro), How Mine v Hwange (Luveve)
