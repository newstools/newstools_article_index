BY VICTORIA MTOMBAThe bakery unit spurred Innscor Africa Limited growth by 30%In a statement accompanying the group s half year results, board chairman Addington Chinake said the bakery s unit recorded a 265% growth in operating profit, although this was off a low base in the comparative year. The group s bakery operations produced a much improved set of results, recording a 30% growth in bread volumes. This volume growth was driven by a management structure re-alignment, improved product quality and improved market coverage and service, he said.The unit processed an impairment charge of $1,47 million and this was in respect of an adjustment in carrying value of the old distribution fleet, which was replaced during the course of the financial year and which will be disposed of during the forthcoming year.Innscor Africa Limited posted a profit of $30,4m from $23,1m for the year ended June 30, 2016 from continuing operations.Revenue for the group was up 6% to $586,9m during the six months period, from $554m during the comparable period last year.The group recorded improved efficiencies at both margin and operating profit levels, resulting in operating profit increasing by 25% over the same period.Profit after tax from discontinued and discontinuing operations reduced to $964 000 for the period under review from $14,49m in the prior year. This decline was due to the fact that the current year profits include only three months and activity from Simbisa and nine months from Axia. In addition, a number of closure and impairment charges were processed in respect of the Spar operations Zimbabwe, Chinake said.The group said despite the migration to a portfolio of light manufacturing businesses, cash generation remained strong, with $54m.The group has an outstanding amount of $2,5m relating to the payment it has made into a trust, as a result of its case with the Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC). This amount is included in working capital. The courts have ruled in favour of the group, and the group awaits repayment of this amount, although the CTC has taken the matter on appeal to the Supreme Court, Chinake said.The group s continuing operations include National Foods, Colcom, Irvines, Capri, Natpak and has non-controlling interests in Profeeds and Probrands.
