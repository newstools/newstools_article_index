PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe yesterday called on the United Nations to speed up reforms of its Security Council in order to include the voice of developing nations. BY BLESSED MHLANGAAddressing the 71st session of the UN General Assembly in New York, Mugabe said: We witnessed commendable efforts at making the selection process of the next secretary-general inclusive and transparent. This greater involvement of the General Assembly and, therefore, the majority of our membership, does not, however, mask the opaqueness of the process at the Security Council level. He called on the UN, through the Security Council, to push for the full realisation of rights for people living under colonial and foreign occupation.Mugabe also took advantage of the occasion to attack Britain and the United States for imposing what he termed spiteful sanctions against Zimbabwe . My country is the victim of spiteful sanctions imposed by the US and other Western countries for some 16 years now. As a country, we are being collectively punished for exercising the one primordial principle enshrined in the UN Charter, that of sovereign independence, he said.
