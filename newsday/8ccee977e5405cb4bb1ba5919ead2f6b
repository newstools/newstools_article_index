CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League basement club Border Strikers parted ways with coach Never Malunga and immediately replaced him with veteran Luke Masomere yesterday as they bid to beat the drop. BY SPORTS CORRESPONDENTBorder Strikers secretary Rodlet Chigwinya confirmed the development and explained the decision was reached due to poor results.&#8220;We parted ways with Malunga and his assistant Hilary Mukuruva and Masomere has taken over as we try get to the right formula to survive, he said. Border Strikers have been consistently conceding goals in the dying stages of matches to end up on the losing side.Malunga, who guided the team to the elite league, had been accused of lack of consistency in team selection often tinkering with the squad even after winning.Malunga was dismissed together with his assistant Mukuruva, the father of Dynamos and national team goal minder Tatenda Mukuruva.The team management hopes the experience and expertise of Masomere will help lift the club from the bottom where they have been stuck since the start to the season.Masomere makes a return to topflight league coaching after a year out having left How Mine in September last year.He will be assisted by Stanley Ncube, who has been recalled following his sacking by Border Strikers together with Saul Chaminuka earlier this year.Masomere immediately got down to business and was in charge at the team&#8217;s training yesterday.He called for collective responsibility in the bid to save the club from relegation.&#8220;I am not going to save this team alone, it s going to be a collective effort if we are to achieve that. It s only possible if we work as a team together with the community and those leading the team,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Survival can only be achieved by the whole club and not the coach and team,&#8221; he said.With just 13 points in the bag from 23 matches so far, Border Strikers are 23 points off the safety zone.
