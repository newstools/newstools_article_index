GOVERNMENT says it has no business in the selection of the war veterans leadership and treats all former freedom fighters equally regardless of their political affiliation. BY XOLISANI NCUBEWar Veterans minister Tshinga Dube (pictured) yesterday said his office had no mandate to influence who heads the embattled Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA), presently led by Christopher Mutsvangwa.He said none of the benefits due to the ex-freedom fighters would be terminated. The Minister of Welfare Services for War Veterans, War Collaborators, Ex-Political Detainees and Restrictees is there to administer benefits to all veterans who would have undergone vetting and admitted as such in terms the War Veterans Act, Dube said. The ministry will not, under any circumstances, suspend benefits they are entitled to, unless if there are any reasons, which restrict the ministry from doing so in terms of the Constitution and the War Veterans Act. The ZNLWVA has been entangled in a leadership crisis following the expulsion of Mutsvangwa and part of his executive from Zanu PF.Zanu PF has on numerous occasions tried to resolve the leadership crisis following the formation of a splinter faction led by Manicaland Provincial Affairs minister Mandi Chimene.Dube yesterday said his office would not get entangled in the leadership squabbles bedevilling the association, as it had its own constitution that guides its operations. The issue of leadership in the association is not my mandate. My ministry s mandate is purely administrative and does not extend to the appointment of leaders in the association. The association is an independent organisation, which has its own constitution that guides them on appointments and expulsions, he said.
