A GROUP of Zanu PF youths yesterday descended at suspended Bulawayo deputy mayor Gift Banda s undeveloped stand at Ascot Race Course demanding that he should surrender the controversially-acquired land back to the city council. BY LINDA CHINOBVABanda is one of the five councillors who were recently suspended by Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere on corruption allegations which included the clandestine acquisition of properties in the city.The toyi-toying youth were singing political songs and carrying placards denigrating Banda and accusing him of being a thief .Banda, who was at the site when the youths were demonstrating, said he was not moved by the protest as he had not stolen the land. Zanu PF youths were here and calling me all sorts of names, but I am not moved by their actions because all that I have done was done above board. This land was advertised for 30 days and there was no objection, he said. These Zanu PF youths feel like they have already found me guilty before the investigation process has even been completed. They should not be used by anyone. If they had any queries or reservations, they should have responded when the property was advertised, not now. When the news crew arrived at the scene of the demonstration, it was business as usual with the builders going on with their work while the demonstrators had already left.Banda and fellow MDC-T councillors Charles Moyo (ward 9), James Sithole (ward 7), Mzama Dube (ward 25) and Reuben Matengu (ward 21) were suspended by Kasukuwere on allegations of corruption.Kasukuwere said a government probe team recently deployed to Bulawayo implicated several councillors in shady land deals and tender scams.He said an independent tribunal would be constituted to investigate the suspended councillors and others who were not suspended, amid revelations that only five councillors had a clean bill.The demonstration came at a time when the MDC-T has thrown its weight behind its five Bulawayo councillors including Banda and threatened to take legal action against government to reverse their suspension.
