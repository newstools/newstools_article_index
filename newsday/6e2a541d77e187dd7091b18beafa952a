My greatest hope came when I joined the GZU Electric Band, as a leading vocalist and performed at events including graduation ceremonies. That is where I got the motivation to release an album. I am happy I have made it, he said.The promising artiste recorded his album at a backyard studio in Mashava, a mining small town near Masvingo.A second-year student at GZU, Nago currently works at YaFm as a co-presenter for the programme, Campus Connection, every Saturday morning.
