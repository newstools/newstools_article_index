AUTHOR and master s degree graduate from the University of KwaZulu Natal, Grace Yeukai Simbi, is set to launch her book, The Role of Faith-based Organisations in Policy Advocacy, which was developed from her dissertation on the same subject. BY LORRAINE MUROMOSimbi told NewsDay yesterday that the book was published after she received an e-mail from the internationally renowned publishing academy, Lambert, seeking permission to develop the highly-rated dissertation into a book. I was very excited and honoured that someone had recognised my work. When I [googled] Lambert, I felt honoured seeing that it was a well-recognised publishing house, she said.Simbi said she agreed to the book idea because she believed her ideas could be of immense help to others.She emphasised that she was geared for the challenge to write more books in the future. Turning my dissertation into a book gave the ideas enshrined within to be shared on a wider scale, what good is food for thought if it can t be used to enrich the minds of many, she said.Simbi, who was born and raised in Zimbabwe, holds qualifications in Psychology and Sociology and is involved in a lot of voluntary and research work.Her book is based on a case study of the Pietermaritzburg Agency for Community Social Action (PACSA), through which she examined the advocacy role of civil society with a focus on faith-based organisations that generally deliver services for the public good. PACSA published information about incidents of apartheid violence hidden by the apartheid regime and many victims of violence came to PACSA for medical care, counselling and support.
