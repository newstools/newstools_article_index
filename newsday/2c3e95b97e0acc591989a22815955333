Hwange (3) 5 Triangle ..(1) 3 HWANGE inform attacker Gift Mbweti inspired his team to an important win with a second half brace in their tightly contested Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match against visiting Triangle at the Colliery Stadium yesterday. BY TINASHE MUNGAZIMbweti scored in the 80th minute and the referee s optional time as Chipangano recorded their seventh win of the season to steer further away from the danger zone on the league table.It was the visitors who opened the scoring through a penalty by Marvelous Mukumba who beat Future Sibanda barely three minutes after the start.Seven minutes later Gilbert Zulu received a cross from Mbeti and fired home to restore parity in the match. The Sugar Sugar Boys defence was caught napping with Zulu returning to complete his brace five minutes after his first goal, firing past Tapiwa Chilenga in goals for Triangle. On 37 minutes Hwange defender Obert Moyo seemed to have put the match beyond the visitors reach with a headed goal.However it was a different story in the second half as Triangle took the game to their hosts and were soon rewarded after Zulu beat his own goalkeeper with Lameck Nhamo putting pressure.Nhamo then got onto the score sheet himself after he beat Moyo before firing past Sibanda in goals.In the 84th minute the slippery Mbweti skillfully weaved his way past defender Donald Dzvinyai inside the box but was hacked down as he went for the kill.Referee Philani Ncube didn t hesitate to point to the spot and Mbweti dusted himself up before sending goalkeeper Tapiwa Chilenga the wrong way.Hwange caretaker, Mebelo Njekwa heaved a sigh of relief applauding his team for their spirited effort. I m happy with the win as the boys made use of opportunities that presented themselves. Yes we may have conceded some soft balls goals, but the boys managed to utilise the chances, said Njekwa.Triangle technical manager, David Mandigora expressed disappointment at the awarding of the penalties, which he described as unfair but was quick to say it was not his side s day. This was not our day we conceded goals unnecessarily but I want to applaud my boys for the surprise comeback from a 3-1 lead, he said
