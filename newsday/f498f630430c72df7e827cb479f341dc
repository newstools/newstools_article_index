A CULTURAL exchange programme between Zimbabwe and South Africa, scheduled to run from September 19 to October 15, is set to offer an opportunity to empower women in terms of cultural enhancement in the tourism sector, Gaza Trust s public relations officer Khesani Matatise has said. BY LORRAINE MUROMOMatatise said the initiative was meant to bring together the Tonga people from Zimbabwe and South Africa to discuss developments that have happened over the years. Through this cultural exchange programme, two Zimbabwean women, Esnath Makese and Loveness Khazamula, have travelled to South Africa to show our cultural products, while they learn something there at the same time, he said. This cultural exchange can be beneficial for both parties as they can access and share the same market since the cultural products are different and complimentary. This is also a huge opportunity to enhance the cultural factor in tourism and provide access to the market as well as improve the quality of the product. Matatise said through the exchange programme, they were hoping to empower women in terms of culture, accessing the market and improving the quality of the products that they made. In a bid to boost the cultural tourism aspect, let us mainstream cultural industries as sources of livelihood. In fact, let us make culture the bedrock of achieving sustainability especially in rural areas, he said.
