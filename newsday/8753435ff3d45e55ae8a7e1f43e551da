People s Democratic Party (PDP) leader, Tendai Biti is a spent political force after his entire Matabeleland North provincial executive of 20 members defected to join former Vice-President Joice Mujuru s party, Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF), recently. By Sparkleford Masiyambiri,Our ReaderPeople s Democratic Party (PDP) leader, Tendai BitiThe defecting team cited irreparable frustration emanating from Biti s acute lack of political stamina, and his gross deficit of an appreciation of the local political matrix, which is necessary to gain relevance among the electorate.Biti has never recorded any meaningful political prowess since he joined active politics in the MDC in 1999. He unceremoniously left the MDC-T after incessant squabbles with the party president, Morgan Tsvangirai, whom he wanted to replace citing his intellectual weaknesses and lack of political aggression. After his departure, his political fortunes waned at an alarming rate. Some more massive defections are expected to hit the party again this week, as supporters are losing faith in his political leadership which seems blind. This explains why he is forceful in pushing for the anticipated grand coalition of opposition political parties, where he wishes to taste the sweetness of power like he did in the 2009-2013 inclusive government. Critics say Biti is better off as a legal practitioner than a politician.It is time for Biti to hang his boots for his time is up on the political front. He can seriously consider law practice as his best fall-back cushion lest he lives to face successive ridicule.
