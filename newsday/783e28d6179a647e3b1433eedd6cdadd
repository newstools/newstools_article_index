ONE of the six suspects accused of assaulting a Zanu PF ward chairperson in Insiza, yesterday claimed the complainant was an agent of land barons whose shady deals had been exposed. BY SILAS NKALAManager Ncube of Lochard resettlement area and his alleged accomplices face a charge of assaulting Zanu PF ward chairperson, Cliford Machona during a meeting held at Lochard business centre on June 6.Ncube is alleged to have stabbed Machona during the fracas, but the former denied the charge. I have never stabbed anyone in my life. Those who claim I stabbed him are being sent by those I reported to the police for selling land. They are fabricating the charges to silence me, Ncube told presiding magistrate Sithembiso Ncube. The matter was remanded to September 29 for judgment.Earlier, Insiza Rural District Council chairperson Daniel Mpofu had told the same court that they were being persecuted for exposing Zanu PF-connected land barons who had mushroomed in the area, parcelling out State land with impunity. Machona was part of the 52 land barons who were banned from attending these meetings because of their corrupt activities, he said.
