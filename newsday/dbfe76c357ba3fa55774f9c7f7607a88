THE Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association (BPRA) has urged city authorities to embark on a massive awareness campaign to help residents appreciate the importance of water rationing. By Khanyile MlotshwaThis comes after council at the weekend warned that it would soon introduce a 48-hour water rationing programme to preserve the little water available in the city s supply dams.BPRA spokesperson, Zibusiso Dube told Southern Eye that it would be unstrategic for the local authority to introduce the water rationing schedule without educating residents on the need to conserve water. Instead of threatening that there will be two days of water cuts, the local authority should be educating the people on the matter, he said. We all appreciate that there is no water and we need to conserve the little that we have. However, water rationing in the absence of information and responsibility from residents will not work. Dube said his association was prepared to assist in such an awareness campaign. An education programme will ensure that everyone feels responsible for conserving water and that they understand the implications of abusing water. We will be willing to participate if the local authority came up with such a programme. Water rationing increases consumption because people tend to hoard water, he said.
