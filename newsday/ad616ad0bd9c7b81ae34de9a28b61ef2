AFTER premiering a piece which features Afro-jazz musician Eve Kawadza at this year s Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo, poet Tinashe Tafirenyika known simply as Tinashe says the collaboration has inspired her to do more in her career. BY SINDISO DUBE The duo enthralled revellers who graced the festival s Women, Wine and Words session with a thought-provoking poetry piece fused with soulful vocals by Kawadza in an event that also featured Nkwali, Lady Tshawe and Charity Hutete. The 24-year-old poet s duet with Kawadza titled If My Country was a Man was a politically charged and thought-provoking presentation. It s called If My Country was a Man, an expression borrowed from a song by David Gueta and Emilie Sandes What I Did for Love. It was amazing doing collaboration with Eve. She is one of the amazing singers in the country, Tinashe said. We worked on the piece for a while and when I heard she was coming through at this year s festival, I reached out for a performance and she agreed. It was good seeing something that we had been working on for some time come to life on stage. Tinashe, who won the Shakespeare Poetry Slam in April this year, was gracing the Intwasa stage for the second time, while Kawadza was making her debut. After this festival I m looking forward to grow my art and to try recording my pieces so that my fans can get something they can take home and listen to as much as they want in their homes, Tinashe said.
