THEATRE practitioner turned political activist, Silvanos Mudzvova, says he has decided to temporarily shelve stage plays and use the streets as his theatre to mobilise the masses to rise up against President Robert Mugabe. BY LORRAINE MUROMOSilvanos MudzvovaMudzvova told NewsDay yesterday that it was now time to break the silence and take the revolution to the streets since the government was not prepared to heed the cries of the citizens. We have been performing in conventional theatres, but who listens to us? It s time to take our plays to the communities and inspire them to take action, he said. From now on, until Mugabe and Zanu PF go, I will not do any theatre play inside conventional spaces. My protest plays and films will be aimed at mobilising Zimbabweans to rise up against this regime. Mudzvova said his ordeal as a victim of police brutality had strengthened his resolve to keep pushing for regime change. I am more than determined to do more protests than before and police brutality has taught me that the State is panicking and does not have answers to the problems being faced by Zimbabweans and as such they have resorted to torture, he said. Yes, they can hurt the body, but that will not stop us from demanding jobs, end of corruption and respect for the rule of law. Mudzvova made headlines in 2007 when he was arrested after the launch of his play Final Push, which was seen in some circles as a veiled instigation for people to oust the Zanu PF regime.In 2010 he planned a one-man demonstration in the central business district through which he intended to push for public officials to declare their assets before taking office. However, the demonstration was not cleared by police.
