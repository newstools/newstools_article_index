Opposition political parties are still an amazing lot. Their dreams of a grand coalition, which they think will dislodge Zanu PF from power come 2018, are still being talked about with no clear direction of where this will start and end. By John Mukumbo,Our ReaderSome so-called activists within some opposition parties have already come up with their preferred candidates, whom they think could lead the grand coalition.The recently held MDC-T 17th anniversary in Bulawayo showed Morgan Tsvangirai being talked about as the preferred candidate, who might lead the coalition. Such views came from Temba Mliswa, who suggested Tsvangirai to lead the coalition. Others said Tsvangirai has been in the opposition field for some time, hence, he is the face of opposition politics in the country.On the other hand, if an opposition coalition is to win the 2018 elections, there would be the possibility of squabbling on the sharing of government funds allocated to political parties, resulting in the split of that coalition. A critical analysis of the existing political landscape in the country shows that a grand coalition would remain a tall order as long as they do not talk about it now.
