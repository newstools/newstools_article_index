One of the key tenets of journalism is the protection of sources and this is one ethic we have lived by, despite obvious pressure from interested parties that we reveal our informants. Comment: NewsDay EditorIt is why media houses celebrated the most when the protection of sources was guaranteed in the 2013 Constitution as a victory for Press freedom and free speech.Without the explicit guarantee of source protection, some of the big stories on corruption, scandal and sleaze would never have seen the light of the day.Some readers often accuse the media us included of hiding behind anonymous sources so that we can push an agenda and are, thus, always curious to know who the informants are.We have always operated in good faith and have protected sources on each occasion because we believe our informants are also acting in good faith when they bring confidential or hidden information to our attention.As a media organisation, our main currency is trust; we yearn to earn the currency of our readers through providing accurate information and also the trust of our sources that when we say we are going to protect them we mean just that.However, in this highly politically-charged environment, people without any scruples and with the most hideous agendas tend to take advantage of news media s commitment to protect sources so they can push their political agendas.This is much to our detriment or any media company as we have made a commitment to truth, objectivity, fairness and accurate coverage of news.We will continue protecting our sources, but the question we ask, is: If a source lies to us blatantly, what sort of protection do they deserve?Such dubious sources not only give us a bad name, but they rock the very foundations that this company is built on. In this current environment, where money and advertising are difficult to come by, the only way we can win more readers and advertisers is through our credibility, without which we are nothing.Going into next year and 2018, the stakes shall be even higher and we are bound to get more information on political parties and factions some of it true and some of it unfortunately not so as groupings try to get one over their opponents.We promise to scrutinise every story carefully and every bit of information shall be meticulously verified in the interests of bringing our readers the truth so they can make informed political and economic decisions.However, we will also continuously verify what sources we talk to and what protection they deserve, because what do media companies gain from sources that lie to them, put them at the risk of lawsuits or criminal cases?
