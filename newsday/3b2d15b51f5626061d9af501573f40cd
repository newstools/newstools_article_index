ZIMBABWE S exports of cut flowers declined by 95% to $3,1 million in 2015 due to stringent export requirements needed by the government, ZimTrade has said. BY MTHANDAZO NYONIIn 2002, Zimbabwe was the second largest exporter of cut flowers in Africa, after Kenya, exporting flowers worth $60m globally, according to the country s export promotion body.In his mid-term fiscal policy review, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa proposed to eliminate export permits in the horticultural sector to provide an opportunity for cut flower growers to tap into the export market.Of this, ZimTrade said, the removal of export permits was expected to improve the export competitiveness of local flower produce through reduction of costs, associated with regulation documents, long waiting periods of processing licences and approvals, as well as exhaustive processing of export documentation. To convert the opportunity into real business, there is need for immediate implementation of the measures to complement the export development and promotion initiatives being spearheaded by ZimTrade, it said.Zimbabwe generally has the ideal natural conditions for the growing of cut flowers.Historically, about 70% of Zimbabwe s flower exports came from Banket, Concession, Glendale, Bindura, Harare, Goromonzi, Trelawney, and Kwekwe, mostly growing roses.Other flowers included proteas, asters and chrysanthemums.The Netherlands is Zimbabwe s largest export destination for cut flowers, importing an average of 69% of the country s flowers in the last 15 years.ZimTrade said there was need for local flower growers to keep abreast with state-of-the-art production practices, as well as marketing techniques. In this regard, ZimTrade encourages them to interact with the Zimbabwe Trade Information Portal (smart tools and trade map) in order to obtain information on the latest trends, it said.Zimbabwe is struggling to boost its exports due to low production, stringent exports requirements among others.Data from the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency indicates that Zimbabwe imported goods worth $444m in August against exports of $203m.
