THE trial of former Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) boss Henrietta Rushwaya, who is being charged togetrher with Edzai Kasinauyo and former Warriors assistant coach, Nation Dube, over match-fixing, was yesterday overshadowed by the arrest of the State s key witness in the matter, Leeroy Waguta. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEWaguta, who is said to be the whistleblower in the matter, was picked up by officers from the CID Serious Frauds just as he exited the courtroom, where he had been warned by magistrate, Lucy Mungwaru to attend court on October 18. Police spokesperson, Chief Superintendent Paul Nyathi later dismissed reports Waguta had been arrested. Leeroy was not arrested, he simply said, but NewsDay was reliably informed the whistleblower had been picked up over a fraud matter on Harare Central CR827/10/12, DR Frauds 48/10/2012 and a check at the police station confirmed Waguta was listed as number 65 on the police wanted list. The incident at the court occurred soon after national team goalkeeper, Tatenda Mukuruva had finished giving his testimony in the continuing match-fixing trial.Before Waguta s arrest, Mukuruva s cross-examination was briefly delayed after defence lawyers, Harrison Nkomo, Simon Mupindu and Simon Simango made an application for exception to the charges arguing there was no complainant in the matter, since Jonathan Mashingaidze, who reported the case to the police, had since left Zifa.The lawyers also argued there was no letter from the Zifa board confirming a resolution had been made to have the matter reported to the police.&#8220;The court knows that Mashingaidze is no longer employed by Zifa. Even if he was employed, there was no resolution submitted to the court as a supporting document,&#8221; Nkomo said.Dube&#8217;s lawyer, Simango also added his voice saying there were only witnesses and no complainants.&#8220;We have no complainants in this court and the honourable court should just discharge and acquit the suspects,&#8221; Simango said.But prosecutor, Timothy Makoni opposed the application, arguing the defence counsels should have applied for exception when the suspects pleaded to the charges.&#8220;The issue of the absence of the resolution letter is the discretion of the court and l believe you should have asked after plea,&#8221; he said.In her ruling, Mungwaru dismissed the application, saying the court was not duty-bound to attend to the application when evidence had already been led.In his testimony, Mukuruva told the court he did not speak to the other suspects except Dube, who was his coach at Under-23 and senior national teams.He was then asked by Makoni if he knew anything about the match-fixing scandal, to which he replied he only came to know about it through his coach Kalisto Pasuwa.&#8220;I was phoned by the coach (Pasuwa) and advised some people would call me in connection with fixing the Swaziland home and away matches, he said. I then received the call from a South African number saying it was coach, Ian (Gorowa) and he asked if I was in a position to come to South Africa, as there was a team interested in my service. I then told him I could not and asked him to contact my team Dynamos.&#8221;The trial continues on October 18.
