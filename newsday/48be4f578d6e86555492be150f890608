FOLLOWING the appointment of a new board for the Zimbabwe Academic and Non-fiction Authors Association (Zana) s Harare province, the incoming chair, Wilfred Mazani, has vowed to ratchet up efforts to clamp down on the pirating of academic books. BY LORRAINE MUROMOMazani told NewsDay that piracy had to be tackled head-on. Piracy is a thorny issue, especially for musicians and actors who have also been crying foul. At the moment we do not have a standing policy which conforms to the Copyright Act and Intellectual Property Act, that whoever is caught stealing our work is brought to book and punished accordingly, he said.Mazani said the board would also have to deal with other pressing issues such as the protection and promotion of the interests and rights of all academic and non-fiction authors. As a board, we want to facilitate authors negotiations for fair contracts with publishers and, at the same time, promote high quality publication of academic and non-fiction books. We would also like to arrange seminars and workshops to train our writers, he said.Mazani said as an organisation, Zana was there to complement other writers associations in the country in a bid to produce a conducive environment for authors.Zana s major mandate is to protect the rights and interests of academic and non-fiction authors in Zimbabwe.
