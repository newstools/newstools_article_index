UPCOMING gospel musician Archbold Nemutenzi is set to announce his entry onto the big stage today with the release of his debut album, Tomutenda Jeso. BY LORRAINE MUROMONemutenzi said this had been a long time coming, after he fell in love with music at an early stage in his life.Inspired by other local gospel greats such as Sebastian Magacha and Thembalami, the emerging musician said he would trade the world for an opportunity to share the stage with one of the country s golden picks of gospel music, Takesure Zamar. Most of my songs focus on praising God. I believe people should sing for God, who has blessed them with the talent, not just for money. Money is a secondary issue. If you sing for the Lord with all your heart and passion, he will lift you up, he said.He, however, expressed his worry about piracy and called on the relevant authorities to clamp down on the cancer. The government should put in place laws and measures to reduce piracy and promote young artistes in the process. Local radio stations should also play their part of playing our songs on the airwaves, he said.
