ORGANISERS of the much-anticipated Jamaican reggae outfit Morgan Heritage s maiden concert in Zimbabwe on October 8 have said the 16-member outfit is expected to touch down at Harare International Airport next week and will spend about 12 days in the country. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOThe show, which was initially pencilled for October 14 at the Harare International Conference Centre, would have clashed with boxer Charles Manyuchi s bout against Frenchman Damie Martin, which had been scheduled for the same date and venue.The Grammy award-winning group will stage its first concert in Zimbabwe courtesy of 2Kings Entertainment as part of their African tour, dubbed Strictly Roots, which will also see them performing in Kenya, Uganda and Reunion Island.Show organiser Dee Nosh, of 2 Kings Entertainment, has urged fans to buy tickets in advance to ease pressure and to avoid congestion on the concert day. The wait is finally over. We are done with all the paperwork and it s a done deal. With the concert now being staged earlier than previously advised after one of our partnering countries changed their concert date that also resulted in us moving the concert earlier than before, Morgan Heritage will now have more time in Zimbabwe, which will see them visiting some of the country s tourists areas during their 12-day stay, he said. The concert tickets are already selling like hot cakes at some of the selling points like Newlands and Westgate Coloursel Furniture shops, Joina City mattress shop, Sopranos Coffee Shop in Avondale and Borrowdale Samsung shop. We have unveiled limited tickets for the mean time, selling at $10 and $20 respectively and after a week they will be selling at $15 ordinary and $25 VIP at all Coloursel Furniture shops across the country. The celebrated reggae outfit had indicated they were eager to perform in the country.
