Twelve Zimbabwean cricketers will be hoping to get picked in tomorrow s Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) draft. BY Kevin MapasureThis year s edition of the BPL will take place between November 4 and December 9 in Dhaka and Chittagong.From the draft, the BPL teams have to pick a minimum of three and a maximum of 11 from a foreigners list of 168 aspirants.Pakistan have the highest number of players from a single country with 42, followed by England, 36, while West Indies have 35.Sri Lanka have three more players than Zimbabwe, with Afghanistan on 10.Batsman Sean Williams has been placed in Category B, where he stands a chance to pocket $50 000 if picked.There are no Zimbabwean players in Category A, where players will be auctioned for $70 000.There are four Zimbabwean players in Category C, with former captains Brendan Taylor, Elton Chigumbura, Hamilton Masakadza as well as Malcolm Waller, who will all be hoping to get a team, which guarantees them $40 000 each.Brothers Sean and Craig Ervine are both in Category D, where there are seven Zimbabweans that include current captain, Graeme Cremer, Vusi Sibanda, Sikandar Raza Butt as well as bowlers Neville Madziva and Chris Mpofu.Participation in the BPL affords local players an opportunity to make some money while also gaining the experience of playing in different conditions.In recent years, Zimbabwean players have failed to break into the more lucrative Indian Premier League while they have also missed out on the Caribbean Premier League.Last year, Elton Chigumbura was the only Zimbabwean picked for the Pakistan Super League, but he missed out this year.
