MUSIC promoter-cum-musician, Brian Samaita, has roped in fellow gospel songbird, Agatha Murudzwa, for a collaboration. BY KENNETH NYANGANIThe Murondatsimba Express frontman confirmed the development on Sunday, after performing before hundreds of people at Revival Centre Church in Mutare.Samaita has already worked with gospel sensation, Blessing Shumba, on his five-track album, which is yet to be named. So far, we have roped in Blessing Shumba and if everything goes well, we are also courting Agatha (Murudzwa), he said. We could have released the album in August, but there were areas we needed to polish up. So we are releasing it in the next month or two. Samaita, who is popularly known as Mwana Mutare in the eastern border city of Mutare, said his new offing was a top-notch effort. This new album is going to be a bombshell. We took our time since we last released something in 2014. It s almost two years now and our fans are waiting patiently, he said. I am still to name the album, but there is a song Jerusarema, which I did with Shumba. In some of my songs, I am trying to highlight issues to do with religion, love and other social issues, he said.Samaita complained that songs from his last album, Tsono, were not getting airplay.Songs on the album include Kubasa, Dzidza Rake, Tinosvika Chete and Simon Zuze.Samaita, who said he was humbled by the invitation to perform at Revival Centre Church, did not disappoint, belting out five songs, including gospel tracks Makanaka Ishe and Tokutendai. I am humbled to be given a chance to praise the Lord through singing, he said.
