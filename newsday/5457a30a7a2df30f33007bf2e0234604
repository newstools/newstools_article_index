DESTINY for Afrika Network leader, Obadiah Musindo, who was slapped with a 90-jail term for defying a 2014 High Court order to pay a $10 135 debt to Bulawayo modelling agency owner, Sipho Mazibuko, has applied for a rescission of the default judgment. BY KENNETH NYANGANI The Zanu PF-linked cleric, through his lawyer, Brighton Ndove of Ndove, Museta and Partners, has also filed an urgent chamber application for the stay of execution of the civil imprisonment.Ndove yesterday confirmed filing both papers at the Bulawayo High Court last Friday, saying they were now waiting for a response from the courts. We have filed an urgent chamber application at the Bulawayo High Court to suspend the execution pending the determination of a rescission of the judgment, he said. Part of the court application for rescission of judgment, where Mazibuko is the respondent, reads: The applicant intends to apply to the High Court for an order in-terms of draft order annexed to this notice and that the accompanying affidavit and documents will be used in support of the application. The debt dates back to 2012, when Musindo hired Mazibuko s firm, Strides Models, to scout for models to participate in a pageant organised by his company in Harare.High Court judge, Justice Martin Makonese last Thursday heard that Musindo failed to honour the debt after Mazibuko hired the models, transported them to Harare for the pageant and subsequently submitted a bill of $10 135 for services rendered.Makonese ordered Musindo to pay Mazibuko $500 per month starting on October 31 until he cleared the debt together with the costs of the suit or risk a 90-day jail term. In February 2014, the late Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Andrew Mutema passed a default judgment against Musindo and ordered the cleric to pay the debt. Musindo failed to comply with the order, leading Mazibuko to file for his civil imprisonment.
