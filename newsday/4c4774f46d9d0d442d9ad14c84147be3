IT took 28 years of dedication, patience and God s power for 39-year-old Bulawayo gospel musician, Wonesai Chimwanambo, better known as Mai Chimwa, to realise her musical dream of releasing an album. BY SINDISO DUBEThe five-track album titled Mbiri Kuna Jesu was released last month and it carries tracks Number One, Tapi Tapi, Kunamata, Kushungurudzwa and Makorokoto. It took me a long time to fulfil my life s dream of producing an album, I started music at the tender age of 11 and I have always been part of my church s praise and worship team. I think the reason why it took long is because I was not ready then, and this year is God s time for me to minister his word through music, as the Bible says, God s time is the best time, Mai Chimwa said. Number One is a praise song extolling God s greatness and power, Tapi Tapi talks of the joy that one experiences in God s presence.The track Kunamata was inspired by an incident in which the musician survived an accident that, however, left her with a fractured spinal cord in 2012, but she has since recovered. I was involved in a deadly car accident, which left my spinal cord fractured and doctors said I would never walk again. I had to go under an operation, but I did not go through it. Yet, by God s power, I was healed and I am walking again. So the song urges everyone to put their trust in God s power and never cease to pray, she said. Mai Chimwa s album also features her 18-year-old daughter, Tatenda, and her producer, Gabz Fire, who provide the backing vocals.
