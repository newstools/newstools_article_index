THE Tendai Biti-led People s Democratic Party (PDP) suffered another setback yesterday after its entire Matabeleland North provincial executive crossed the floor to join former Vice-President Joice Mujuru s party, Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF). BY NQOBANI NDLOVUAbout 20 PDP Matabeleland North interim executive members, led by provincial organising secretary, Lameck Ndlovu, defected to ZimPF citing frustration. We (the provincial executive and others) were no longer happy, the party leadership has also been absent, hence, our decision to cross the floor to ZimPF, which is visible on the ground, he said in an interview.The mass defections came a week after PDP deputy national chairperson, Watchy Sibanda, and 10 other party members from Matabeleland South also dumped Biti s party.ZimPF Matabeleland North interim provincial chairperson, Max Mnkandla, yesterday confirmed the defections. We are happy that people are identifying themselves with the real party, ZimPF. This actually shows our stamina as a party in Matabeleland North province, he said.But, ZimPF interim national chairperson for the information and publicity committee, Methuseli Moyo could neither confirm nor deny the defections, saying there was nothing official for now .PDP provincial spokesperson, Edwin Ndlovu also professed ignorance on the matter, but accused ZimPF of using unorthodox means in its membership recruitment drive. We have heard the rumours. We are, however, having talks with the ZimPF, which at the same time goes behind our backs to entice our members to cross the floor on promises of positions, he said. It not only shows that they are not negotiating in good faith, but also shows ZimPF officials have not let go of their Zanu PF DNA. We remain the party of choice in representing the people s aspirations.
