GWANDA residents have called on the government to stop criminalising small-scale miners, but formalise their activities, as they were contributing significantly to the country s minerals output. by Obey ManayitiSpeaking during public consultations on the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill, residents said small-scale mining had become the major source of livelihood for thousands of families in the region.Umzingwane Miners Association leader, Liberman Ndlovu, said the amendment was overdue, as the Mines and Minerals Act was introduced during the colonial era to safeguard white interests. We want to encourage people to do the right things. It s important that the Act is now under review so that it fits into current mining trends and that it becomes relevant to specific mining issues, he said. We want the fees that we pay to be lowered so that they are not prohibitive to those that want to get into mining. Former Gwanda mayor, Rido Mpofu said the Act must be clear on prospection so that it does not create conflict among communities.He said the mining sector should not supersede other sectors because areas outside mining such as farming will be seriously affected.Mpofu said there should be consistency in the Act, adding it was regrettable that the government had forfeited about 2 000 gold claims, rendering thousands of people unemployed. He said this would create tension between new and old holders of claims. Others said they were against keeping claims for speculative purposes.Gwanda residents spoke strongly against riverbed mining, saying punitive measures should be put in place to avert siltation and environmental pollution.They also said allocation of mining claims should be above board to encourage the participation of many, adding that there should be clear guidelines prohibiting mining near established infrastructure. Residents also called for harmonisation of various fees, royalties and levies paid to the Mines ministry, Environmental Management Agency and local authorities.They also said there should be mechanisms to avoid the creation of ghost towns at the end of mining activities.
