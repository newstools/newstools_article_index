A 36-year-old Chitungwiza man was arrested at OK Supermarket in Hwange after being spotted through closed circuit television (CCTV) pocketing some condoms and cigarettes before attempting to sneak out of the shop without paying for the goods. By SILAS NKALAThe suspect, Canaan Guveya pleaded guilty to the charge when he appeared before Hwange magistrate Rosemary Dube on Tuesday and was remanded to tomorrow for sentencing.In his submissions, Guveya blamed his actions on alcohol and while answering questions he could hardly speak up, and reeked of stale beer. I admit to the charges, it s just that I was very drunk after having taken a lot of opaque beer, he said, while saying several things unrelated to the case, leaving the gallery in stitches. I heard that Chipangano is a very good football team, so I had come all the way from Harare to support them. Guveya s behaviour prompted the magistrate to order that he be examined by two medical doctors to ascertain his mental status before she sentenced him.Prosecutor Onias Nyathi presented that on September 30 this year, Guveya entered OK Supermarket in Mpumalanga in Hwange at around 8pm and took one box of 20 Pacific cigarettes and three condoms.However, an official in charge of the CCTV identified him and alerted a security guard, Felix Fusire, who later searched him and recovered the stolen goods leading to his arrest.
