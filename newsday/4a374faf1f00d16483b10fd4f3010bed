Chitungwiza Town Council should respect the residents and ratepayers. By Shelly Guni,Our ReaderChitungwiza Municipality town clerk George MakundeFirstly, the council is failing to provide adequate clean water supply for the residents. I am disappointed with the way these so-called service providers are acting up. For close to three weeks now, Chitungwiza residents have not received any water despite some areas having minimum supply that saw most of them filling only up to a 20-litre bucket of water. Chitungwiza is one of the biggest towns in Zimbabwe with a population of over one million people. What surprises me is the fact that on 16th of each month they come to our doorsteps reading the water meter. What exactly they are taking? I think it s high time they introduced smart water meters in Chitungwiza so that people will have to pay for what they have used.My second issue is directed to town clerk George Makunde who seems to be there, but in actual fact has done nothing to show his presence. We wonder why Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere can justify Makunde s presence in the council set-up.On the other hand, the employees who collect garbage do a good job. But I don t know whether they leave their station with the truck already loaded or they just move to every area without emptying the loaded truck. Instead of them removing garbage, they are always dropping a lot of it in the streets. No blame game, but whoever is doing that should take full responsibility for their action.More action less talk.
