Former Mashonaland West governor, Peter Chanetsa was this week slapped with an indefinite prison term, but later spared time behind bars after CBZ Bank accepted his payment plan to settle a $19 000 debt. BY CHARLES LAITONThe former Hurungwe North MP appeared at the High Court on Wednesday before Justice Lavender Makoni, who endorsed the out-of-court settlement agreement between Chanetsa and CBZ after he offered to offset the debt by paying $1 000 monthly.The financial institution, through its lawyers, Mugwadi and Associates, had issued summons for civil imprisonment against Chanetsa sometime in April under case number HC3765/16.This was after Chanetsa had allegedly disregarded two court orders instructing him to settle the CBZ debt granted by the court in October 2014 and September 2015.Part of the civil imprisonment summons issued against Chanetsa read: You, Chanetsa, Peter Tapera, the defendant, of Greensleeves Farm, Biri, Chinhoyi, are called upon to pay the plaintiff the sum of $10 000, being an amount owed to the plaintiff and interest in the sum of $9 109. You are required to pay this sum by virtue of judgments against you in the High Court at Harare on October 22 and September 23, 2015, under which you were ordered to pay the sums of $10 000 and $9 109,16 respectively. The summons continued: If you fail to pay the sum specified above, you must appear before the High Court &#8230; to explain why you have not paid and to show why an order for your imprisonment should not be made on account of your failure to pay. After receiving the warning of civil imprisonment, Chanetsa contacted the bank and both parties reached an out-of-court settlement, which effectively spared him from being committed to a term of imprisonment.
