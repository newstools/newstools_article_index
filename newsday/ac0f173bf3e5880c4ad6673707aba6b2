By Stephen ChadengaTakawira Ndlovu was yesterday jailed for the murder of Never Zhou when he appeared before High Court judge Justice Maxwell Takuva, who convicted him for killing his colleague.The incident occurred at a beer drinking party at Siphilisiwe Nyamande s homestead in Mazinyani village in Chief Bankwe s area on September 22, 2010.The court heard that Ndlovu killed Zhou after the latter declined to give him $5 he had asked for.In passing sentence, Justice Takuva said it was the duty of the courts to force society to honour the sanctity of human life. Had it not been that the deceased was the initial aggressor, you could have got a lengthier sentence for such a crime, he said.Justice Takuva said instead of retaliating and taking the law into his own hands, Ndlovu should have reported the deceased to law enforcement agents.The court heard that when the beer ran out at around 5pm, Ndlovu approached Zhou and took him to a secluded place outside the homestead where they engaged in some discussion.Ndlovu later returned shouting that Zhou had stabbed him. The two entered a kitchen hut, where Ndlovu assaulted Zhou with a metal cup several times on the head.Eventually, they got out of the kitchen hut and it is then Ndlovu armed himself with a wooden stool and struck Zhou on the head, leading to the latter s death.
