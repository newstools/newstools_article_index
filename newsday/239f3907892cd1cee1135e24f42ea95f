The project will support the ministry s awareness programmes on the importance of infant education and ensure children with disabilities have full access to primary school education.The MoU with JF Kapnek provides for support towards ECD infrastructure and daily nutritional support and technical and vocational education for ECD centres in rural areas.Dokora said the partnerships, which are the first since the completion of the new curriculum framework that the ministry is implementing beginning from last year to 2022, were expected to generate opportunities that would benefit learners, education institutions and local communities. On the implementation, Dokora said the ministry was committed to full co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation at all stages to ensure there are no implementation slippages .
