PARENTS with children at Tshelanyemba Secondary School in Kezi have accused authorities at the Salvation Army Church-run school of chasing away students who were squatting in teachers cottages, saying the move was inhuman. BY LUYANDUHLOBO MAKWATIThe alleged incident occurred two weeks ago with the church authorities saying they feared the students could be abused by the teachers. The students had resorted to squatting at the school to avoid walking long distances of at least 20km to and from school each day. Our children have been staying at the school and as a community we welcome these teachers for assisting our children, but now if these people are chasing our children at night and it is not fair, a disgruntled parent who declined to be named said.Zanu PF Matabeleland South provincial chairperson Solani Njemnyama Moyo confirmed the incident and blamed government for failing to build adequate schools in the province. We are blaming the government for failing to bring education closer to us. Schools are very far and Good Samaritans are assisting our children. We know that it might be wrong for students to be closer to teachers cottages or share cottages with teachers, but desperate times call for desperate measures, hence, they should be there because as a region we have been deprived education, Moyo said Contacted for comment Salvation Army public relations secretary Captain Mafukidze said the students had been housed at the school facilities without the church s consent. It is true that we had students who were asked in the presence of police officers to vacate the cottages because we were trying to protect our children and the teachers. At times people get tempted and we will end up having a situation worse than the one at hand, he said.This came amid reports that the province was experiencing an increase in the number of school dropouts because of the long distances students have to walk.Matabeleland South provincial education director Tumisang Thabela could not be reached for comment yesterday.
