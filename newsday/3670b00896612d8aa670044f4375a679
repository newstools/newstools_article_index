LOCAL Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere yesterday said government will not pay attention to protesters, vowing Zanu PF has no plans to implement the electoral reforms demanded by opposition parties. BY BLESSED MHLANGAKasukuwere the Zanu PF national commissar said both the government and the ruling party would not be moved by anti-government protests. How can Didymus Mutasa and Joice Mujuru (ZimPF leaders), failed politicians, who were enjoying power just yesterday under these electoral laws, call for reforms now? They are doing so because they have no capacity to win elections, he said.Kasukuwere said the government would only listen to debates on electoral reforms if they came through Parliament and not street protests . You want us to listen to people wearing gowns and playing street soccer at Copacabana? That will not happen. If they want to change the government, they should come for elections, he charged.Kasukuwere also threatened to come down hard on Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association secretary-general Victor Matemadanda for allegedly threatening President Robert Mugabe s family. Who is Matemadanda and where does he get the power to issue threats against the First Family? We want to tell him that we will hold him accountable if anything happens to them, he said.Matemadanda, a former Zanu PF central committee member, on Monday called on Mugabe to protect his family by heeding the call by Zimbabweans to step down.
