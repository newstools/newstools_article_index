GOVERNMENT has ordered a re-tender or suspension of the $60 million Egodini terminus upgrade, citing massive irregularities. BY MTHANDAZO NYONIOne of the 20 winners of the Food World Live The Good Life competition, Simon Garabha, stands next to his car at the grand draw of the 20 BMW vehicles at the Harare Gardens on SaturdayIn 2015, the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) awarded South African civil engineering firm, Terracotta, a contract to develop a transport hub and shopping mall at Basch Street Terminus, popularly known as Egodini.The project, valued at $60 million, was on a build, operate and transfer basis and would come at no cost to council.According to the public-private partnership, Bulawayo would ultimately own it once Terracotta had recouped its investment.However, according to a Local Government, Public Works and National Housing ministry report on corruption allegations levelled against BCC officials, the government has ordered the city to either re-tender or suspend signing of the contract and renegotiate based on the feasibility study citing tender irregularities. Council can do either of the two: (It) may retender the project with a comprehensive brief of the requirements based on the feasibility study or suspend signing of the contract and renegotiate based on the feasibility study, reads part of the report.The project was advertised as an expression of interest in 2012 under the previous council and there were three participants who expressed interest, and these were Terracotta ($59,6 million), Pearl Properties ($30 million) and Road Port (Pvt) Ltd ($3 million), the report said. It noted that there was no environmental impact assessment and feasibility study carried out to show how both parties were to benefit financially from the investment. Such feasibility study would have also established the lease period and reflect the rate of return, which would justify the lease period. The report added that the fact that Terracotta revised its initial contract, resulting in sweeping changes being made to the agreement, indicated that the company was not in essence committed to its initial proposal and only wanted to be awarded the contract before renegotiating for another contract, which was unfair for other bidders. There are no preliminary designs forwarded by the developer to date in violation of the agreement by both parties. Given the fact that no feasibility study was done, there appears to be an assumed lease period, which is not supported by any economic calculation, the report reads. The majority of the changes create a financial responsibility on council with no corresponding reduction on the project cost. The refurbishment is expected to see the terminus handling at least three million travellers per month and creating more than 1 000 jobs for the community.As part of the redesign of the terminus area, BCC would expand existing roads into the site and create dedicated pedestrian routes to increase traffic access.The site will include a transport hub located on the Basch Street ground level, retail sections and parking bays.
