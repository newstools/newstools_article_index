BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAMubaiwa has a meeting scheduled with the club s board of directors where he said he will tender his resignation.The administrator said he had made up his mind on stepping down and will not reverse it no matter what persuasion.Mubaiwa s resolution to quit follows a decision by the board to reinstate assistant coach Murape Murape whom Mubaiwa had fired two weeks ago.Pamire has moved swiftly to try and convince the board that he would be the right person to succeed Mubaiwa, who has got success under his belt. I have been around for quite some time at Dynamos having been club chairperson. It pains to see what the team is going through. I have an emotional attachment to the team and will be ready to assist if I am asked to, Pamire said. Dynamos are used to be in the top three and anything less is not easy to accept. I think i can assist in the short term.

The Harare businessman said he had been trying without success to meet with the board to make his position official.Dynamos is set to complete a barren season after falling out of the Chibuku Super Cup.
