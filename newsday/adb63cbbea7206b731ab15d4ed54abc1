TOP comedians Samantha Gonyeti Kureya and Doc Vikela who have been scheduled to perform in the United Kingdom under the banner of Bustop TV in October have pulled out of the show citing irregularities, NewsDay has learnt. BY LORRAINE MUROMOThe comedy brand informed their fans of the developments on a Facebook post. As Bus stop TV, represented by Doc Vikela and Gonyeti, we would like to inform you that we are no longer part of the UK show set for October. The concept of the show was not fully explained to us and after seeing the poster, we felt we can t be part of the show and the promoters have agreed to remove us from their show. Apologies to those who were excited to see Doc Vikela and Gonyeti performing in UK. Regards Bustop TV, read the post.In a follow-up interview with NewsDay, Doc Vikela confirmed the turn of events. The withdrawal by myself was after consultations with my management and other stakeholders, he said.Bustop co-founder, Lucky Aaroni, also confirmed that they have cut ties with the promoters of the show. We are no longer part of the show, yes, but for more details talk with the promoter, he said.A representative of the United Kingdom-based promoters, who was only identified as Arthur, however, accused his rivals of throwing spanners into the works. He claimed there were some rogue elements that had influenced Bustop TV to chicken out of the arrangement. The truth of the matter is they were briefed about it during the negotiations and evidence to that effect is there. There is a section of the Zimbabwean community that is influencing acts and comedians we have in the package to exit the programme, he said. They are going with the flow, but we have our contract with them and will deal with it accordingly but we also respect their views and decisions.
