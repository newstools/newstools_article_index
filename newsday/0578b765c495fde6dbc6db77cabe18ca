Opposition parties and analysts have warned that amending the Indigenisation Act is not enough to save the ailing Zimbabwean economy or improve foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. BY BLESSED MHLANGAJohn RobertsonPresident Robert Mugabe on Thursday revealed during the official opening of the Fourth Session of the Eighth Parliament that the Act would be amended to bring clarity to the law, which has caused confusion in his government. It will be recalled that I issued a statement to clarify government s position regarding the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Policy on April 11. The relevant Act will, thus, be amended to bring it into consonance with the enunciated policy position, Mugabe said.Economist John Robertson said nothing short of repealing the Act would improve the status of Zimbabwe as a safe investment destination. I believe the Act has to be repealed completely because as long as the ownership rights of investors are not protected, investors will continue to shun Zimbabwe. The Act has done more harm to business in Zimbabwe, Robertson said.He described Mugabe s speech as shallow and lacking significance, saying it would hardly make any difference or impact on the market.Another economist, Prosper Chitambara, agreed, saying amending the Act alone would not make much difference without addressing fundamental issues such as infrastructure and adequate financing. We have to put our house in order by availing adequate infrastructure. In fact, inadequate financing is cited as one of the top limiting factors of doing business in Zimbabwe today, he said.Chitambara said the Act itself acted as an implicit tax on investment and therefore hindered the ease of doing business in the country.Social commentator Rashweat Mukundu said Zimbabwe remained a high political risk and therefore an unsafe environment to do business, he said government needed to restore trust and reduce political risk instead of just amending laws.MDC-T spokesperson Obert Gutu said his party position was to have the Act repealed, Constitution respected and legitimate government elected under free and fair elections if the economy was to work.People s Democratic Party spokesperson Jacob Mafume said no amount of amending the Act would work as long as corruption and patronage in the Mugabe government was not dealt with.
