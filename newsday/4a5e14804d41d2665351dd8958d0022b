TENDAI BITI S People s Democratic Party (PDP) has been dealt another heavy blow after its deputy secretary-general, Tongai Matutu and former MP Paul Madzore re-joined Morgan Tsvangirai s MDC-T. BY OBEY MANAYITIThe two left the MDC-T in 2014 along with the likes of Biti and Elton Mangoma.Speaking at a Press conference attended by senior MDC-T officials including the two vice-presidents, Nelson Chamisa and Elias Mudzuri in Harare yesterday, Matutu said he had made a sober decision without any coercion, as he felt it was only proper to rejoin the more credible MDC-T. I want to make it very clear that when I joined PDP, I was aware of what I was doing and now that I am leaving, I am also aware of what I am doing and I make no apology for leaving PDP and I will also not explain the reasons why I left, Matutu said. I have come alone, deliberately, not because I am the only one who is coming, but there are quite a number coming and maybe some of them are waiting to see what will happen to me. This is not something I am doing because I have been pushed, I have never been forced by anyone nor was I bribed by anyone. MDC-T spokesperson, Obert Gutu said Madzore would be presented at a later stage.The party&#8217;s deputy national chairman, Morgan Komichi said it was refreshing that most party deserters were seeing the light. PDP spokesperson, Jacob Mafume said: The two, who have left now are useful, but they have not gone to Zanu PF. What would be alarming would be if they went to Zanu PF and what would be worth noting are those that come from Zanu PF. As for these comrades, we will continue working with them whatever they call themselves now. We have younger and newer comrades, stepping up to their place. PDP has been hit hard by defections in the past weeks, with notable senior officials like deputy president, Samuel Sipepa Nkomo joining the Joice Mujuru-led ZimPF.
