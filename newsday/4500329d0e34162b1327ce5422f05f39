The battle for the the Zanu PF-controlled Ushewokunze Co-operative, which has so far seen bloody battles on factional lines, continued unabated on Wednesday afternoon after several women were attacked allegedly by a group of youths reportedly aligned to Harare South MP, Shadreck Mashayamombe. The women, who have since made a police report (RRB2891730) at Borrowdale police station, claimed they have endured continued harassment allegedly because of their alignment to the current co-operative chairperson, Fungai Nyarota.A faction led by former co-operative chairman, Ezekiel Karimanzira &#8211; who is reported to be a Mashayamombe ally &#8211; is alleged to be pushing for the control of the co-operative.&#8220;We wanted to fetch water and youths (named) came to harass and beating us up, claiming that we were supposed to move out of the co-operative, and that is was a directive from Mashayamombe&#8221; said Suwina Chizengwe.Mashayamombe distanced himself from the fights, claiming he had nothing to do with what was happening in Ushewokunze.&#8220;Why did they have to mention my name. I was even away in Japan so how could I have bee involved in all that?&#8221; he said.
