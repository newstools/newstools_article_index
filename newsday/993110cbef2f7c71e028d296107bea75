Warriors coach Kalisto Pasuwa s demands for a starting salary of $7 000 have been met with mixed feelings by Zimbabweans although most fans seem to support that he should be paid the amount. Annegrett DubePasuwa who has been coaching the Warriors since 2014, has been having difficulties getting his salary from Zifa prior to the new contract in which the football mother body is offering him $3000.&nbsp;Zimbabweans rallied behind their favourite coach as they felt that Pasuwa is being offered very little as compared to the hefty salaries that foreign based coaches received. This stirred debate on social media on how foreign coaches were awarded despite their failures.&#8220;One must be paid for his job not for his skin color. Sainfiet &amp; Valinhos were taking how much? Pasuwa&#8217;s must be close to those figures, he has even done better than Valinhos,&#8221; said one of our Facebook readers.Allen Musimbe an online reader saidZIFA and Ministry of Sports and Culture should take football as an industry which can generate income for the country. This starts by taking the players and local coaches seriously if Pasuwa&#8217;s salary is $ 3 000 per month what if you sign Mourinho , Zifa is going to pay him $ 7 000 per month because he is a foreign coach. Would you think he will accept such deal? If the contract says 7 000 then they should give him or more. For the coach and players to deliver they should be rewarded for their efforts. So ZIFA man up and pay our Coach his salary stated on the contract. Another reader Jackie Simbabrashe was of the opinion that Pasuwa was justified in his $ 7 000 salary demand on the basis of his qualifications and the results he had achieved so far.&#8220;Pasuwa is qualified and should get that. How much did Zifa pay that failure of a coach Saintfiet the Belgian for the one (1) week practice sessions he did with the Warriors?&#8221;Under his tutelage the Warriors successfully qualified for the African Nations Championship (Chan) in October. Prior to that Pasuwa led the Under 23 soccer team to the All Africa games. Other readers were not sympathetic as they accused Pasuwa of being too expectant with the current economic downturn that the country is facing. &#8220;Our government is broke $800 is enough for him if he complains again get another coach we want a coach who will take Warriors @ (at) first in top 10 rank of the best teams in Africa then from there we&#8217;ll talk of increasing his salary but for now he has shut up&#8221; commented Eugene Lunga on our Facebook page.For Pasuwa, salary scale should range from $3 000 to $5 000. that&#8217;s Enough for Coaching The &#8220;Warriors&#8221; who are still to improve on their performance!!!Zimbabwe ichitadza kuprovider basic things like water and electricity vozogona kubhadhara coach we team inodyiwa 7000? zvemuno????! (Zimbabwe is failing to provide basic things like water and electricity, will they be able to pay the salary of the coach of a team that is defeated $7 000?) asked Kimberly Muchena.&nbsp;Do you think that Pasuwa deserves a salary of $7 000 ?
