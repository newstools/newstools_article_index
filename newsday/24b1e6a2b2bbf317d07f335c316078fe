DISGRUNTLED Zanu PF youths who are unhappy over the manner in which Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere has handled the stands dispute at Ushewokunze Housing Co-operative in Harare, have threatened to join their MDC-T counterparts in a planned anti-corruption demonstration scheduled for Wednesday next week. BY BLESSED MHLANGA We are fed up with this corruption, Zanu PF leaders have become land barons. They go around the country claiming that the land belongs to youths, yet they are feeding themselves. It s now time for bhora musango (siding with the enemy), said a Zanu PF youth, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The latest move came at a time the Zanu PF youth leadership has vowed to block demonstrations targeted at Kasukuwere.MDC-T youth leader, Happymore Chidziva, said they would go ahead with the planned demonstration despite intimidation by ruling party youths.Chidziva said the demonstrators would be demanding the resignation of Kasukuwere, Energy minister Samuel Undenge and Home Affairs minister Ignatius Chombo. We have to take this corrupt government head-on and demand that all corrupt ministers must step down because all this suffering is not because we are a poor nation. It s all because of some corrupt people who are milking our country dry and filling their pockets, he said, adding Zanu PF youths were welcome to join in the protests.MDC-T home affairs youth secretary, James Chidhakwa, said they were geared for a possible nasty fight with Zanu PF youths seeking to block the protests.
