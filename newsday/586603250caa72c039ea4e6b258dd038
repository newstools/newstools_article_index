A LOCAL businessman, Nathan Mnaba, was yesterday confirmed as the legitimate owner of Norwich Trading Company, which was at the centre of a $460 000 fraud case. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEThe case involved businesswoman Nighert Parween Savania and her son, who were accused of attempting to fraudulently claim shares from his business.Mnaba s confirmation came about after Harare magistrate Lucy Rusinahama acquitted Savania and her son, Deen Mahendra, of fraud, saying they had, instead, disposed their shares to Mnaba and there were no shares hidden by the pair in the firm.Rusinahama said Mnaba was the majority shareholder in the company as evidenced by the appointments of directors in the company.Mnaba appointed all directors at Norwich Trading as the owner of the company.The magistrate said submissions by the State did not prove that Nighert and Deen interfered with Mnaba s business operations as they sold it without any intention of coming back.She further said Nighert became the beneficiary of the estate because of her husband s death and there was no wrongdoing by selling the estate.A witness, John Mukumbirirwa, from the Registrar of Companies, had told the court that Mnaba was registered as the sole owner of Norwich Trading despite his indication that there were other 29 separate shares.Allegations against the pair had been that after the death of Mahendra on March 9, 2010, Nighert took charge of Norwich Trading s day-to-day operations but a year later, the duo connived to sell Norwich Trading to Mnaba.The State alleged they misrepresented to Mnaba that Nighert owned 100 shares in Norwich Trading and that she was the sole beneficiary.It was alleged they did not disclose to Mnaba that the company was part of a deceased estate which was yet to be registered with the Master of the High Court for execution.Nighert also did not disclose that there were other shareholders holding a total of 29 shares.The State alleged as a result of the misrepresentation, Mnaba agreed to purchase Norwich Trading for $380 000 and agreed to a payment plan.
