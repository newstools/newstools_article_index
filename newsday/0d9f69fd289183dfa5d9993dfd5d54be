SOUTHERN Africa Parliamentary Support Trust director John Makamure has said MPs can easily circumvent the whipping system in Parliament from their respective political parties through making use of committees to present issues in a non-partisan way. by PAIDAMOYO MUZULUMakamure said this while addressing MPs at a 2017 pre-budget seminar held in Harare on Tuesday.MPs in highly polarised Zimbabwe are frequently whipped into party lines by chief whips on contentious motions and not allowed to use their expertise or conscience in voting. The committee system should make you get around the whipping system. A committee should have a position paper that is defended by all committee members and is delivered as the committee position, Makamure said in response to a question by Mkoba MP, Amos Chibaya (MDC-T), who had asked what parliament could do to be effective and beat the whipping system on issues of common interest that transcend political divide.Zimbabwe s National Budget has over the years been contentious, with the executive sometimes resorting to the carrot and stick measures to have MPs pass budgets.The government has in the past mollified MPs by giving them loans to buy vehicles, sitting allowances and fuel coupons.Harare West MP, Jessie Majome (MDC-T) also questioned the Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda on why MPs were not able to defend and lobby for Parliament s budget vote during debates.Majome said all the other votes were defended and lobbied by parliamentary committees that shadow the departments, but nothing was done about Parliament s vote.Mudenda, in his response, said: Parliamentarians should seek that information from the Clerk of Parliament and in the event that they are denied, they should approach any office. The committees of Parliament are still engaged in gathering public views on the 2017 budget that is likely to be presented to the House next month.
