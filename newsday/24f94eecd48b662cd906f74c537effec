FORMER Zimbabwe national cricket team captain, Elton Chigumbura has been left out of the squad to face Sri Lanka in the two-Test match series in Harare and Bulawayo starting at the end of the month. Elton ChigumburaBY MUNYARADZI MADZOKEREThe 30-year-old all-rounder, who has played 14 Tests and 202 one-day internationals (ODIs) for Zimbabwe, was conspicuous by his absence from the squad of 20 players released by Zimbabwe Cricket yesterday.The development came after he had captained the Zimbabwe A side in the second of the two four-day matches against Pakistan A, which concluded with a crushing eight-wicket defeat for the hosts in Harare yesterday.Chigumbura failed to tick with the bat during the unofficial Test match managing just 38 runs in the two innings.A clean hitter of the ball accustomed to the shorter version of the game, Chigumbura has struggled for form in recent caps for the country and the selectors could be entertaining the idea of making him a specialist ODI and T20 player.Veteran seamer, Christopher Mpofu also makes a return to the national fold after he was dropped last year after travelling to Pakistan, as well as playing a home series against India.With nine Tests under his belt, Mpofu adds a wealth of experience to the bowling attack also having worked under new coach Heath Streak at Tuskers.Uncapped young batsman, Tarisai Musakanda, who has been in scintillating form for Zim A, looks set to earn his first senior team cap after he was included in the squad.The 21-year-old former Midwest Rhinos player scored three half tons in recent matches against the visiting Pakistanis.Young bowler Carl Mumba (21) was also included in the squad.Most of the senior players, including captain Graeme Cremer, Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza Butt and Tino Mawoyo, all made the list for the Sri Lanka series.Squad Greame Cremer (captain), Tinotenda Mawoyo, Hamilton Masakadza Chamu Chibhabha, Prince Masvaure, Carl Mumba, Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Sikandar Raza Butt, Malcolm Waller, John Nyumbu, Christopher Mpofu, Regis Chakabva, Richmond Mutumbami, Brian Vitori, Donald Tiripano, Peter J Moor, Brian Chari, Taurai Muzarabani.
