REDCLIFF residents are sitting on a ticking health time bomb amid reports of two confirmed typhoid cases this week. Mayor Freddy Kapuya confirmed the typhoid reports recorded in Rutendo high-density suburb, which he attributed to the acute shortage of water being experienced in the Midlands town. BY BLESSED MHLANGA We have serious problems with water supply owing to the debts on water, which Redcliff owes to Kwekwe City Council because our residents are failing to service their bills. In the past week, we recorded two cases of typhoid owing to the water challenge, but the situation has since normalised and the cases were treated, Kapuya said, adding the closure of many companies, including Ziscosteel, had whittled down council s revenue base.The heavily-indebted Redcliff Municipality receives its water supplies from Kwekwe City Council but has been failing to pay for the service.Kwekwe mayor Matenda Madzoke yesterday vowed to tighten screws on Redcliff. We can t keep supplying them with water that they can t pay for. We need money to buy water treatment chemicals, pay the electricity bill and other things so that they get the water supplies, so if they can t pay, we can t keep supplying them water for free, said.
