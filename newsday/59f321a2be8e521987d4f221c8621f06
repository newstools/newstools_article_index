THE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has said the banking sector s aggregate core capital increased by 5,8% to $1,04 billion for the half-year ended June 2016 from $982,50 million during the same period last year on the back of improved earnings performance. BY TARISAI MANDIZHAIn his mid-term monetary policy review statement, RBZ governor John Mangudya said the banking sector average capital adequacy and tier 1 ratios of 24,17% and 21,51% respectively as at June 30, 2016, were above the minimum required capital adequacy and tier 1 ratios of 12% and 8% respectively. All banking institutions were adequately capitalised and in compliance with prescribed minimum capital requirements. Most banking institutions have set deadlines to comply with the December 2020 capital requirements, largely through increased recapitalisation of retained earnings, following improvement in asset quality and subsequent decrease in loan loss provisions, he said. In the period under review, six other institutions had core capital levels above $50m, he said.The deadline for banking institutions to comply with the $100m minimum capital thresholds is December 2020. Banking institutions are, therefore, urged to continue with the recapitalisation initiatives and consolidate the gains recorded to date. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor progress towards compliance with the 2020 minimum capital requirements, he said.In the period under review, total banking sector deposits increased by 5,2% to $5,9bn as at June 30, 2016, from $5,6bn as at December 31, 2015. Mangudya said during the period January to June 2016, however, the banking sector was exposed to cash shortages, largely as a result of macro-economic challenges facing the country, including lack of fiscal space and the current account deficit.He, however, said the banking sector average prudential liquidity ratio, at 52%:47% as at June 30, 2016, was above the regulatory minimum requirement of 30% and 18 banks were compliant with the prudential liquidity ratio as at June 30, 2016.
