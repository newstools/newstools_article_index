THERE is need for speedy policy and legislative reforms in the mining sector to plug illicit financial and mineral flows that rob the country of potential revenues, the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development (Zimcodd) has said. BY MTHANDAZO NYONIIn its recommendations for the 2017 National Budget, Zimcodd said the country was losing a lot of revenue through illicit financial and mineral flows and there was need for Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa to consider that when crafting his budget. There is lack of transparency and accountability in the governance of the country s resources leading to loss of potential revenue to support the annual national budgets, Zimcodd said.Early this year, President Robert Mugabe said at least $15 billion could have been lost in Marange diamond fields in seven years. Such huge amounts could have been utilised to fund the country s social sector needs, it said. The country has lost huge potential revenues through illicit flows which could have been used to adequately support social sectors domestically instead of reliance on foreign aid, Zimcodd said.On public debt management, the social economic justice coalition said as the country continues to re-engage the international financial institutions through the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and other initiatives, there was need to avoid incurring any further debts for the country before a thorough public debt audit of the existing commitments was done. It also urged government to address the issue of ghost workers , huge executive positions, and executive travel and allowances costs to ensure adequate compensation of the civil servants.Zimcodd said government should create an enabling environment for the informal sector, including scrapping of the Statutory Instrument (SI) 64 of 2016 and other inhibiting policy frameworks for the sector.In July, government promulgated SI64, which restricts the importation of products that have local equivalents.The 2017 National Budget should also adequately support the implementation of the Auditor General s 2014 and 2015 reports recommendations, it said. Potential revenues lost through illicit means and other corruption related channels notably the $15 billion diamond money should be traced, Zimcodd said.
