In response to Leave me alone: Jonathan Moyo: It s funny indeed, if the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission is sincere about eradicating corruption, why not investigate everyone in the higher echelons of political structures. The ObserverHigher Education minister Jonathan MoyoAre those calling for Jonathan Moyo s arrest not part of this corrupt syndrome that has destroyed the very fabric they claim they want to restore?Moyo is going to have the last laugh in all this circus.And to those that are calling for Moyo s crucification they should explain to us why no one has been pursued by Zacc over the missing $15 billion diamond revenue?Why Information Communication Technology minister Supa Mandiwanzira was not brought to account over the money he abused from his ministry just last month.This selective application of the law shows how we are far from eradicating corruption.Who among these politicians can stand up and claim to be uncorrupt or clean?The country should revisit the leadership code of 1980: politicians and current businesspeople need to declare their assets.The fear and anxiety among the so-called politicians is that we are likely witness what happened to the late Enos Nkala and his friend Morris Nyagumbo.With the current political situation and characters in the government, I for one, don t see any trustworthy leader, who can lead this once promising nation towards total development, except crooks and cheats. For argument s sake, let s take stock of each and every minister, then we will know the truth of the current situation.The problem with Zimbabweans is that we are engulfed in tribal and regional politics and shout too much on trivial cases, leaving out the core issues, one of them being the missing diamond money, the future of the poor children, poorly-equipped hospitals, poor roads, hungry citizens, high rate of unemployment, etc.
