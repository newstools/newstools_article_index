BY MUNESU NYAKUDYAInformation, Media and Broadcasting Services minister Christopher MushohweAddressing young businessmen and women on Wednesday, acting ICT minister Christopher Mushohwe said the ministry was nurturing a culture of innovation and risk- taking. Work on putting in place the necessary framework for the funding has been completed and the ICT ministry will soon be announcing a launch date for the fund which we hope to take place within the next few days, Mushohwe said in a speech read on his behalf by Miriam Chikukwa, Harare Metropolitan Province minister. The main objective of the bank is to increase the ICT research and development uptake by young innovators and research institutions in Zimbabwe in order to increase the total number of home grown ICT applications. Mushohwe said the ministry wanted to create employment and promote a culture of ICT innovations and development among young Zimbabweans and to establish innovation hubs within the country and to provide business and technical training. This government innovation package will incentivise and reward innovation and entrepreneurship in risk taking thereby making a bridge of young innovators who will move this country forward to reclaim its rightful position on the global technological ladder, he said.Mushohwe said government also wanted to ensure that Zimbabweans were equipped with an imaginary invention to make sure the spirit spreads across the nation. Innovation is the currency of the future, it converts research into wealth. Unless we recognise this reality and start working in a focussed manner on creating a strong innovation culture in our country now, we will be left behind.
