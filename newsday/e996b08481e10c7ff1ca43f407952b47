BY ARTS REPORTER SOUTH Africa-based Zimbabwean Barbara Anne Langridge, has formed an organisation called TIRIMUKA aimed at fostering and promoting the community for Zimbabweans in the Diaspora.Langridge said their inaugural event is set to be launched this Saturday on Heritage Day with performances by musicians originally from Zimbabwe, including Mike Gwenyambira, Fatha B, DJ Idem, Fanuel Dambulani and Lilian Basvi.She said focus of the organisation was to bring together Zimbabweans living in Cape Town. It s 10 years since most of us came to South Africa and most likely this will be our future home and there is little chance we will return home (even) after political change because life here is better, she said. The ingredient we all miss is community and a sense of belonging. Hopefully, through TIRIMUKA, we can achieve some of these ideals. Langridge said she was confident that they would achieve their mission as a way of celebrating Zimbabwean heritage.A former farmer who fled Zimbabwe in 2007 Langridge has joined hands with other Zimbabweans in Cape Town to promote Zimbabweans in South Africa through social events and skills sharing.
