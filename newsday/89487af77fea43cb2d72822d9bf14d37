A LAWYER representing Eddie Zviitwa in the trial where he is alleged to have stolen $85 000, yesterday claimed what was at the centre of the matter were drugs and gold rather than cash, as the case took a new twist. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDEZviitwa s lawyer, Rekai Maphosa, alleged the investigating officer, Saydon Chinzete, knew that the complainant, Taghlan Hosvep, lost gold and drugs worth $85 000 instead of cash, a claim the police officer denied.Maphosa further alleged that Hosvep was pounced on by unknown robbers, but Chinzete dug in, insisting the suspects were all linked to the theft.Zviitwa is jointly charged with Keagan Blumears, Taurai Makata, Obey Chakacha and Tinashe Hakunavanhu.Regional magistrate Hosiah Mujaya remanded the matter to October 3 for continuation of trial after Chakacha, Makata and Hakunavanhu s lawyer excused himself on health grounds.Allegations are that on March 29, the complainant, Hovsep, was lured to a Mount Pleasant house on the pretext of buying a Hyundai excavator.The State alleges Hosvep went to Blumears with a bagful of cash intending to buy the heavy-duty machine.Blumears then communicated with his alleged accomplices and bogus detectives. The bogus detectives purportedly arrested Hosvep for dealing in minerals and supporting Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa s faction, before taking away his money.The State alleges Zviitwa then left with the bogus detectives on the pretext he was going to recover the money, but he returned empty-handed, claiming the money had been taken away by senior officers.As a result, Hosvep was prejudiced of $85 000 and nothing was recovered
