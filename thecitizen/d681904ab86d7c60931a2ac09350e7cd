Kibaha. Sports bodies have appealed to the government for funds. Stakeholders meeting in Kibaha yesterday said they were underperforming due to budgetary constraints.They were speaking on the first day of the Sports Legacy symposium taking place at the Filbert Bayi Sports Centre in Kibaha.Tanzania s Olympic squad head coach Khalifa Abdallah said sports development needed strong financial support. What sports organisations are currently getting from the government was not enough to meet their needs, he said. We need support outside the ministry of Sports.
