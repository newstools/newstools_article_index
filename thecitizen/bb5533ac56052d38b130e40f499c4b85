Arusha. Cost-cutting measures announced by the East African Community (EAC) in May this year have started to pay off.This achievement is thanks to Tanzania President John Magufuli whose cost cutting measures back home provided a lesson to the regional body.The regional organisation recorded savings amounting to $588,768 (more than Sh1.2 billion) during the first three months of implementation of the exercise, targeting mainly travel expenses.This was disclosed in Nairobi early this week by Secretary General Liberat Mfumukeko during a meeting with Kenyan cabinet secretary responsible for EAC Affairs Phyllis Kandie.The EAC boss said the reforms he instituted upon assuming office on April 26, this year will target savings to the tune of $6 million (over Sh12 billion) during the 2016/17 financial year. Implementation of the reforms are already showing positive results in that for the first three months of implementation (May to August), the first estimates point to savings of $588,768 in travel expenses, he said.However, Ambassador Mfumukeko admitted that EAC was still facing financial problems, largely due to budget contributions from the partner states and the long delay in getting disbursement from the African Union which, according to him, was impacting on some programmes, including that of the Africa Peace and Security Architecture (Apsa).He could not divulge much details but the Kenyan cabinet secretary said delay by the partner states to remit funds to the EAC in Arusha was because the member countries themselves were also going through austerity measures.However, she lauded Ambassador Mfumukeko for his tough stance and efforts geared towards implementing reforms that focus on cutting costs at the EAC secretariat, saying the measures would benefit smooth implementation of regional projects and programmes.Few weeks after taking over as the new EAC boss, the tough-talking Mfumukeko announced a litany of stringent measures to reduce expenditure at the cash-strapped body and its organs. He said the regional organisation has been compelled to do so because of liquidity challenges as a result of delays in disbursement of contributions by both the partner states and development partners.The SG, who is the accounting officer of the Community, said the measures and reforms he is spearheading followed intense consultations of the staff members as well as heads of a dozen institutions spread across the region.Under the measures, the duration of the technical meetings involving delegates from the partner states and EAC staff would be reduced to a maximum of four working days with the number of delegates from the partner states facilitated through EAC budget not exceeding two. The EAC delegates to technical meetings shall not be more than three members of staff. In order to reduce conference costs, where possible, the use of free-of-charge, government-owned facilities should be encouraged while the procurement unit at the Secretariat shall negotiate for corporate conference and accommodation rates in each partner state, Mr Mfumukeko said.Under the cost cutting drive, the EAC would minimise the use of hotel and commercial conference centres in meetings involving staff members only or with consultants and shall be held at EAC premises which has some meeting rooms.Members of staff will only be allowed to be away from their respective duty station(s) for not more than 50 per cent of their time.Exceptions shall be considered on individual basis provided that the cumulative number of days for a particular month does not exceed 65 per cent of the time.
