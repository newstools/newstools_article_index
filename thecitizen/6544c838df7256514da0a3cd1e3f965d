Dar es Salaam. Mbao FC are just making their debut in the Vodacom Premier League, but it is already evident that they face a tall order to survive in the topflight.It may be too early to predict who will suffer the drop this season, but judging by their performance so far, the Mwanza team looks odds-on favourites.They have played four league matches, lost three and drew once. The ailing side has one point out of a possible 12.Speaking after 3-1 thrashing by African Lyon on Monday, Mbao head coach Etienne Ndairagiye blamed their poor form on experience. It is tough in the topflight, especially, when you have a many players without experience in the top league, said the Burundian. The boys are talented, but no matter how talented you are, you need experience to compete at the top level. However, I believe that they will rise to the challenge after a few matches. Mbao FC occupy the 15th position in the 16-team table with a goal difference of -8 in just four games. Although it is our first season in the premiership, we have to roll up our sleeves; we can t go anywhere with this form. We have to start grinding out results, he added.Majimaji FC of Songea survived relegation by a whisker last season, but they still have started the season on the wrong foot. The cash-strapped team nicknamed Wanalizombe is at the bottom of the table without a point after playing four matches.This is probably their worst start to the league for the 1998 champions.Ndanda FC of Mtwara are also in the relegation zone with two points from four outings.Nonetheless, their goalless draw against defending champions Young Africans last week may help reverse their fortune.
