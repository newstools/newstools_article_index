Dar es Salaam. Former National Social Security Fund (NSSF) director general Ramadhan Dau, is tipped to be Tanzania s envoy to Malaysia, it has emerged.The minister for Foreign Affairs, East African, Regional and International Cooperation, Dr Augustine Mahiga, confirmed this on Wednesday that Dr Dau had indeed been designated for the diplomatic posting to Kuala Lumpur. He was responding to a query by The Citizen that wanted to establish the truth about reports on an online publication Africa Intelligence revealing the appointment.The government has not made any official public announcement on the said posting. According to the reports, Dr Dau has been waiting for confirmation and accreditation by Malaysia since January when the appointment was reportedly made by President John Magufuli.However, Dr Mahiga refuted sections of the report suggesting Dr Dau will not be able to take up the appointment in Malaysia over unspecified reasons.Speaking to The Citizen soon after a press conference in Dar es Salaam on the start of the EAC Heads of State Summit on Thursday, Dr Mahiga was quick to dismiss the reports linking the delay in taking up the job to recent local investigations into NSSF affairs. Dr Mahiga clarified that it was normal for accreditation of diplomats to take a long time depending on country to country systems. As countries, we differ on the mechanism used for investigation of the appointed envoy, in some cases it happens they buy time before accreditation of the appointees, added Dr Mahiga. Dr Dau was removed as NSSF director general early in the year by President John Magufuli who then named him ambassador designate. He had served the pension fund as its top boss since 2001 when he was picked by the then President, Mr Benjamin Mkapa.Several NSSF directors and other senior managers were recently suspended from office to pave the way for investigations into alleged imprompriety in the handling of mega-housing projects worth billions of shillings.
