Mwanza. The Fire and Rescue Force in the region is conducting training on safety for primary and secondary schools to teach students what to do in the event of a fire.The Mwanza regional Fire and Rescue Force commander, Mr Andrea Mbata, said over the weekend that the training would equip school children and students with basic firefighting and rescue skills including how to use fire extinguishers.He said currently the force in the region is inspecting schools to establish whether firefighting equipment have been installed in accordance to the law.So far 520 students at Mwanza and Mkolani secondary schools have been trained. Another 100 students at Mihani and Nyanshishi secondary schools also underwent training as well as 56 students from Mosabe Secondary School.He noted that there have been disturbing incidents of fire outbreaks in schools across the country recently. Students are left unsupervised at night when most fire outbreaks occur. They therefore should be in a better position to handle such situations and rescue themselves, he said.The Regional Commander added that that force has involved electrical technicians in the training so that they assess the wiring systems installed at the various schools.He noted that they are advising school dormitories to do away with iron grilled windows and doors that open from inwards saying they hinder escapes in case of an emergency.
