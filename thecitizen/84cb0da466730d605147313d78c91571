Dar es Salaam. The Registrar of Political Parties Judge Francis Mutungi has brushed aside accusations levelled against him by Chadema that his office is bent to de-register the opposition party.Reacting to the accusations in his office on Thursday, Judge Mtungi said there was no way he was going to de-register, not only Chadema, but any other political party because there were laws, rules and regulations governing that process. Chadema will be struck off the register only if it breaches the law and regulations, which govern its registration and operations, he said.He made the remarks after Chadema Elders Wing leaders told reporters at a press conference that there were indications that the registrar was looking for excuses to de-register Chadema.The wing s secretary-general, Mr Roderick Lutembeka, told the press conference that a series of events showed the registrar was conspiring with the authorities to de-register the main opposition political party.Mr Lutembeka said the move by the registrar to call off two reconciliation meetings, which had to be conducted on August 29 and 30 as well as the one scheduled for September 3 and 4 without concrete reasons proved his motives.But Judge Mtungi said he postponed the meetings to give stakeholders more time on how to solve the problem in a systematic way. I advise Chadema not to do things emotionally..., he said.
