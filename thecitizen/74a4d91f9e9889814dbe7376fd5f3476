Musoma. Tax evaders will not be able to access services from State-run institutions once the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) rolls out a plan to link its database to other agencies.Speaking to businesspeople here on Thursday, TRA Commissioner General Alphayo Kidata said the strategy would also improve revenue collection.Mr Kidata listed the National Identification Authority (Nida), Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (Brela), Immigration Department, Tanzania Electricity Supply Company (Tanesco) as the State-run agencies earmarked for the taxman s database link.He said under the envisaged plan, people will get services from these agencies after showing their tax clearance certificates.He said they were also working with the National Electoral Commission to identify politicians who have evaded taxes. NEC would only allow aspirants of political posts who have no tax backlogs.Mr Kidata said: Tax clearance certificates will also be one of the criteria to approve contenders. We have devised this strategy to ensure leaders are role models. It is time the electorate voted for people who pay taxes. At the meeting, one of the entrepreneurs Robert Sylvester said businesspeople were willing to pay taxes if the agency reduced uncalled for levies.He said authorities should review the VAT Act so that all registered businesspeople pay tax equally.
