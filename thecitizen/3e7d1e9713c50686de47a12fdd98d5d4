Madrid. Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato stands trial Monday accused of overseeing a corrupt system that helped him and other executives misuse funds on hotels, parties and luxury shopping when he was a Spanish bank boss.Uncovered in 2013 by a journalist who saw a hacked email alluding to black credit cards, the case threatens to land the former economy minister and onetime star of the ruling conservative Popular Party (PP) in jail and with a hefty fine.It is also another thorn in the PP s side after repeated failed attempts to form a government following two inconclusive elections, due to a lack of support that is in large part due to corruption scandals sullying the party.
