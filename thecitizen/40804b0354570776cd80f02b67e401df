Kilombero.

There s no peace here. Border disputes between our village and neighbouring hamlets often erupt a few days before the planting season commences forcing some families to flee, said Mr Dunia.Officials from the ministry urged traditional leaders and residents in the three villages to meet and find a lasting solution to the conflicts.He encouraged citizens to create land registries of their villages which are important criteria to enable them to get their land assessed.
