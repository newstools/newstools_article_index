Dar es Salaam. Recent data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that Tanzania s economy took a dent in the first quarter of this year.Bank of Tanzania (BoT) also corroborated the data noting that economic growth rate dropped to 5.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared to 5.7 per cent recorded in the same period last year.Answering a question by Mr Freeman Mbowe, who is the leader of Opposition in Parliament, on Thursday, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa insisted that there was a need to conduct a research to prove Mr Mbowe s assertion that the country s economy was in shambles.NBS data, though, shows that the slump in the economic growth was chiefly caused by underperformance of the three major sectors, namely, construction, transport and manufacturing.Going by NBS data, the construction sector growth slumped to 4.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to 23.2 per cent recorded during the same period a year earlier.Transport sector declined to 7.9 per cent compared with14.51 per cent, while growth in the manufacturing sector dipped to 7.4 per cent from 9.9 per cent last year.The state-owned NBS further attributes the decline in the performance to low investment in the sectors during the period under review.For its part, the World Bank (WB) links the fall in economic growth to a couple of factors, the first being additional fiscal resources needed for provision of free basic education and expansion of higher education students loans programme. The economic growth is hit by additional expenditure needs, which is equivalent to 0.7 per cent of the country s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), reads part of the WB report.The report also attributes the situation to weak implementation of the new 2015 Value Added Tax (Vat) Act, that was meant to capture revenue on other forms of trade which were previously not included in the 1997 Act.In his question in Parliament on Thursday, Mr Mbowe expressed concerns that the economy was not doing well and wanted to know what the government was doing to address the situation.He noted, for instance, that drop of cargo at the Dar es Salaam Port was one of the major signs that all was not well. Some transport companies have reportedly cut their operations by up to 40 per cent, while others have relocated to neighbouring countries because of uncertainty in the business environment in Tanzania. Is the government aware of this? What steps is it taking to address the situation? Mr Mbowe asked.However, Premier Majaliwa said in his reply that there was no concrete evidence the economy has not been performing well in recent months. The Premier told Parliament that it was difficult for the government to come up with a definitive answer without first carrying out an in-depth study.All is not badThe government expressed optimism that the economy would mushroom and enable it to meet the annual target of 7.2 per cent growth as projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). If we were to judge economic performance by using one quarter, we would not record a 7 per cent growth last year given that our starting was not impressive, I believe we will make it, reads a part of the WB report.It shows for instance that even in 2015 the economic growth in the first quarter fell to 5.7 per cent, down from 8.2 per cent during a similar period a year before, but at the end of the year amounted to an average of 7 per cent, similar to 2014 record.BoT s optimism is supported by a relatively good performance in the mining sector which grew to 6.5 per cent in quarter one of 2016 compared to 0.6 per cent recorded during the same period a year before.It also had expectations from the communications and agriculture sectors which grew from 11.5 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, in quarter one last year to 13.4 per cent and 2.7 per cent in the same period this year.The government also believes in good performance in export and services earnings, cement production, power production, and decline in interest rates on loans.The performance of exports of goods and services improved to $10,096.9 million in the year ending June this year, compared with $9,398.5 million during the same period last year, thanks to tourism, manufactured goods and gold.Earnings from services amounted to $3,860.4 million in the year ending June this year compared with $3,681.8 million posted during the same period last year, contributed largely by receipts from travel and transportation.The production of cement during the first quarter of this year increased by 7 per cent to 725,000.4 tonnes, up from 680,000.1tonnes that was produced in the same period a year before.The country s power production capacity increased by 14.5 per cent to 3452.2 KWh during the first half of 2016, up from 3,016.7KWh during the same period in 2015.An economist from the Dar es Salaam University, Prof Haji Semboja, echoed BoT s sentiments that there was a room for the economy to perform well. This slight change in economic growth has nothing to do with the drop in economy at the end of the year if more investments will be encouraged, he noted, saying the drop was attributed to some changes the government was undertaking.He added: This is just a transition period as the government was walking the talks on its promises, whose fruits might be seen in the future. Economist Prof Samuel Wangwe, for his part, admitted that the economy was declining and poor performance in the said sectors was a bad indicator to the country s economy. It is true the economic growth has declined in some areas like construction, among the others, this is an indicator of poor investment in the sectors in question, which call the government to do something, he said.The government should improve environments for investments in a bid to attract more investors in the country and eventually increase earnings from tax collections. If the government is to collect more revenue from tax, it should make sure working environments are friendly to investors to attract both local and foreign investors, noted Prof Wangwe.Civic United Front (CUF) Information, Publicity and relations director Salim Bimani pointed an accusing finger at the government on the ground that it lacked priorities in its day to day handling of the economy. Our country has failed to have a vision and right priorities that will enable us to have a strong economy, he said in a statement the party issued to the media on Friday.He added: Never expect good performance in the economy if you don t have priorities basing on the ranks of importance.
