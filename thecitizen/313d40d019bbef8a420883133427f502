Handeni. The District Magistrate Court has sentenced 40-year-old man to 32 years in jail for defiling a four-year-old girl.Public prosecutor Selemani Kawambwa told the court that Yasini Abdallah a resident of Lusanga Village in Kilindi District committed the crime in March, 2015 and the parents of the girl reported the matter to the police.Delivering the judgment, senior resident magistrate for Handeni and Kilindi districts Arnold Kileo said the doctor s report showed the victim had sustained bruises on her private parts. The court sentences you to 30 years in prison for the offence of defiling a four-year-old child and for two other offences of jumping bail granted to you previously and for not appearing in court between January and September this year, said the magistrate.In mitigation, Yasini said he jumped bail as a result of an abdominal problem and wondered why the person he had sent to inform the court had failed to do so.He also prayed to the magistrate would issue a fine instead of serving the jail sentence. The magistrate rejected the plea.
