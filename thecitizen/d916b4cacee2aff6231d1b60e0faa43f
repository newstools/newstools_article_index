Dar es Salaam. A 30-year-old Dar es Salaam man, who was allegedly sacked while in jail, has sued his employer, seeking his job back.Faraly Kiwango filed the case at the Kinondoni District court on Thursday. He accused his employer, Security Group Ltd, of unlawfully dismissing him.Before being jailed, Mr Kiwango was a supervisor with the Dar-based company. The complainant, who resides in Temeke District, told the court that he was sentenced to two years in prison on February 24, last year after he was found guilty of inciting violence ahead of the 2015 General Election. He told the Court that, while serving his sentence at Segerea Prison in Dar es Salaam, he wrote a letter to his employer.He also claimed that, in the letter, he informed his employer he wanted to resume his job after completing his prison term. Mr Kiwango, who was not represented by any lawyer, said: I informed my employer as I knew that there is no law in Tanzania, which says a person is automatically dismissed from his or her job if jailed. The court heard that Mr Kiwango was dismissed from his job on May 14, 2015, without consideration of the letter he had written seeking to protect his position while serving his term.
