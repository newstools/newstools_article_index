Dar es Salaam. The national Under-19 team coach Khalil Rehemtullah believes that the opening win at the ICC-Africa Division 2 World Cup qualifiers will help his side perform well.The Tanzanian boys will start their campaign in South Africa against Sierra Leone on September 12. The boys are doing quite well in training and our focus now is to win the first game of our campaign in South Africa. I believe that it will give my players the needed confidence to excel, said Rehemtullah.The Tanzanian team will be looking to regain their lost respect at the tournament having put up mediocre displays during the previous two editions in both the senior and junior events. Yes, we have had a run-of-the-mill performance in recent editions, but we have put that behind us and we will go all out seeking victories, he said.The team, which has been training at the Muhumbili Cricket Academy, is expected to leave for South Africa on Friday ahead of the tournament, which will start at the weekend at Willowmoore Park in Benoni. We know that Sierra Leone have grown from strength to strength, so we will not underrate any team at the tournament. The boys have already promised victory, he said.According to the fixtures, Tanzania will next face Nigeria before clashing with Zambia, Rwanda and Botswana.
