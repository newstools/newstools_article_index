Nairobi. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday failed to name interim officials of the newly formed Jubilee Party lending credence to reports of intense infighting over the slots in the ruling coalition.Former officials of the parties that agreed to merge were left disappointed when he ended his speech at Nairobi s Kasarani stadium without installing an interim office.The Sunday Nation has learnt the decision was informed by concerns that a line-up said to have been agreed on before the event by the President and his Deputy William Ruto could have triggered discord among some of the 12 parties that closed shop to join the outfit, on whose ticket he hopes to secure a second term in office.To some of the officials who were expectantly waiting for the announcement with the hope of landing some of the plum positions, Mr Kenyatta comes across as having failed to bite the bullet but the party leader s advisers feel that was the best way out as he works out the ideal combination that will steer the affairs of the newest party at a crucial time when the country head to the general elections next August.As things stand, only the party leader (Mr Kenyatta) and his deputy (Mr Ruto) are known.Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi, who co-chaired the steering committee ahead of the merger, told the Sunday Nation a fortnight ago that Mr Kenyatta will name the temporary officials at the launch.He said only the president and his deputy know who will take up the positions. They are keeping it close to their chests, there isn t even a whisper about it but all officials from the merging parties gave an undertaking to accept any positions given to them. Not everyone can say become chairman, secretary-general or treasurer, he said.There has been intense jostling for the new positions with that of the secretary-general being the subject of most of the vicious fight.Disgraced former Energy Cabinet Secretary Davies Chirchir has been fronted by those in Mr Ruto s camp while from western, Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka - who led his New Ford-Kenya into the merger - and TNA chairman Johnson Sakaja are being fronted.
