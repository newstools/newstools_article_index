For those of us who have survived a certain number of decades, we have a number of stories on the big hair craze better known as the afro. Back in the seventies the hairstyle gained even more popularity as a fashion statement when pop icon Michael Jackson was still singing with his brothers.Natural and hard to ignore the natural though high maintenance look was part and parcel of some of our young lifestyles.In upper primary school around that time, I had made it a point to learn how to undo my corn rows on Friday afternoon and plait Bantu knots (mabutu) so that by Sunday morning ready for church I would comb out a mean afro. This was despite the fact that later during the day I would be seated in front of my mother plaiting my hair all over again for another week at school.Considered a natural trending phenomenon there were a few afro wigs on sale. Black was the favourite colour. Nowadays there are tailor-made afro weaves that save many a bad hair day.Just in case you are stuck with choices for hairstyles for a certain function trust me you will not go wrong with an afro.
