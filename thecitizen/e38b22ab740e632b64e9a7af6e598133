Arusha. Financing business ventures is one of key issues to feature prominently in next month s regional entrepreneurship conference. The East African Business and Entrepreneurship Conference and Exhibition to be held in Nairobi. The conference will also discuss manufacturing and infrastructure. The event will provide an opportunity for businesses and governments to discuss ways of strengthening entrepreneurship in East African Community (EAC). One year after the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, we saw the need for a critical follow-up on the actual tangible impacts of initiatives like Trade Africa or Power Africa that have come along with large funds to promote entrepreneurship. This is why we will have two sessions on the opportunities and experiences to access those funds and on the requirements for other ways of financing, said EABC executive director Lilian Awinja. The conference is organised by the East African Business Council and investment agencies of EAC member states. On the session, financial Institutions such Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) will elaborate on the key issues relevant for the financing of entrepreneurial enterprises.
