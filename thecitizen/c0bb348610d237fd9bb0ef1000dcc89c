Tandahimba. Cashew nut growers in the district have complained that the official system for selling the crop does not guarantee timely payments.Speaking to reporters the growers expressed bitterness over the fact that they have not been paid, despite the fact that the buying season had been declared open in September.A resident of Ching ati Village, Mr Nurdin Mtili, remarked: We are not opposed to the government directive on using the receipt system, as is in principle it is efficient, but we are required to open bank accounts, which is costly. Moreover, we have to pay the labourers we engage to pick the cashew nuts. In a bid to settle the financial obligation farmers opt for the informal system better known as kangomba to sell the cashew nuts. The farmers said they would like to be paid shortly after the crop selling season begins.
