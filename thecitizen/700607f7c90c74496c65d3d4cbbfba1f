I don t plan to vie for party chairmaship in the near future. I will continue to serve the Civic United Front as a loyal member, said Mr Mtatiro.According to him, CUF is in good hands following the departure of Prof Lipumba, who served as the party s chairman for a very long time.He also revealed that CUF would participate in nationwide demonstration called by the main opposition party Chadema from October 1. I commend Chadema for pushing back the rallies to October 1 in order to get more time for consultation on how to preserve democracy. On behalf of CUF members and supporters I am declaring that we will participate in the rallies, said Mr Mtatiro.He criticised President Magufuli s decision to shift to Dodoma.He noted that instead of wasting a lot of the money to relocate the governemnt headquarters, the Head of State could focus on reviving industries. The government should use the money to revive the industrial sector as a way of generating more employment opportunities, said Mr Mtatiro.
