Dar es Salaam. Tanzania s annual inflation rate has decreased to 4.9 per cent in August compared with 5.1 per cent recorded in July, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced yesterday. That means the speed of increase in prices of commodities declined compared to a month before, noted the NBS Director of Population, Census and Social Statistics, Mr Ephraim Kwesigabo. This is the first time this year that the annual headline inflation rate has decreased below 5 per cent, which is the government s mid-term target for the inflation rate, according to him. The decline in the headline inflation was attributed to decline in inflation rate for food and non-food items, according to Mr Kwesigabo. The annual inflation rate for food consumed at home and away from home fell to 7 per cent in August, from 7.8 per cent posted in July. Food and non-alcoholic beverages account for 38.5 per cent weight in the consumer price index. On the month-on-month basis, the headline inflation rate decreased by 0.2 per cent in August. Food and fuel prices are key drivers of inflation in the East Africa s second-biggest economy. Some food items that contributed to the decline in the headline inflation include cereals (0.6 per cent), cassava flour (2.1 per cent), sardines (3 per cent) and vegetables (2.6 per cent), according to the NBS. Non-food items that led to the decline in the headline inflation include gas (22.8 per cent), kerosene (8.8 per cent), diesel (9.8 per cent) and petrol (15.8 per cent). The purchasing power of the Sh100 which measures the change in the value of consumer goods and services that the local currency could buy at different periods, reached Sh96 and 83 cents in August 2016 from December, 2015. During the period, the headline inflation rates for Kenya fell to 6.26 per cent from 6.39 per cent while that of Uganda fell 4.8 per cent from 5.1 per cent in July.
