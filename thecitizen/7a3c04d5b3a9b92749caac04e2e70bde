Musoma. The Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (Sumatra) is planning to introduce a speed tracking instrument for passenger vehicles in a fresh bid to curb road accidents.Speaking here on Friday, Sumatra director for road transport regulation Johansen Kahatano said the authority, in cooperation with traffic police, has resolved that speeding drivers will be sent to court. Mr Kahatano said Sumatra has signed a contract with a company which has already started the construction of a control centre that will be complete by November this year. He noted that the new system would enable Sumatra and the police to monitor movements of vehicles from the centre. We are seeking lasting solution to reckless driving, he said.
