Dar es Salaam. President John Magufuli has revealed that he was once advised to print new banknotes in order to put in check dirty money which is not in circulation due to hoarding by unscrupulous businesspeople.However, the President, who didn t divulge much detail, said he disregarded the advice but added that, if things will get worse, he would be left with no option but to do it.President Magufuli made the revelation when officiating the 14th Annual Engineers Day which was attended by at least 2,500 registered engineers.The President said: We have managed to reduce inflation to five per cent. We want to stabilise the value of the shilling so that only hardworking people may enjoy the fruits of their labour. At one time I contemplated printing new notes in a move to frustrate people who hoard money for their own selfish interests. I am still thinking about it. The President further said if the government s vision of attaining middle-income status by 2025 through building an industrial economy is not attained, it is engineers who would shoulder the blame. Don t just pass the blame to my government when an industrial economy is not built. It is also your responsibility to build an industrial economy. I will be happy if I see some engineers take risks and establish manufacturing industries, he said.According to him, he has appointed several engineers in all ministries as an indication that he is strongly committed to work with them in building an industrial economy. You shouldn t be driven by foreign engineers; you should be the drivers of the country s process of industrialisation, the President further told engineers.He also challenged the professors who taught him at the University of Dar es Salaam who, despite their brilliance, have failed to spearhead industrial development.The President listed several engineers who have been appointed directors, permanent secretaries, deputy permanent secretaries and some ministers in his government, insisting that they should be held responsible if engineers failed to transform the economy from agrarian to an industrial economy.The President s sentiments on loose and dirty money that is not invested has come at a time when there is liquidity problem in the banking sector. A survey conducted in August by The Citizen showed that for the past three months, there was a decline of bank deposits by 20 per cent among the leading commercial banks.In case bank deposits continue to decline, the lending capacity of the commercial banks will also shrink causing further decline of investible funds, according to experts.Delivering the welcome remarks, the minister for Works, Transport and Communication, Prof Makame Mbarawa, also challenged engineers to participate in the announced tenders for expansion of regional airports and advise the government on how to reduce the cost of airports expansion.In his introductory remarks, the Chairman of Engineers Registration Board (ERB), Prof Ninatubu Lema, said that engineers have the confidence that the JPM administration will leave a positive legacy.Prof Lema said engineers were ready to assist in building an industrial economy, but they had four requests, including giving opportunity to young engineers to participate in big projects such as construction of standard railway gauge and a crude oil pipeline from Kampala, Uganda to Tanga.Other special requests include: government commitment to support training of technicians through granting loans in order to reduce shortage of this cadre and the third, to bind foreign consultants for engineering works to employ local experts.The ERB chairman also requested the government to provide Sh10 billion for construction of engineering centre in Dodoma but the President quashed this one, urging engineers to raise funds by forming companies or business associations.
