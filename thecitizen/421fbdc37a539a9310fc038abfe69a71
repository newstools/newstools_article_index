The Mufti Commission is independent, we are not alighed to any side, and so people should not worry about their safety no one can intervene in our work, he said. We are appealing to those who have concrete evidence to hand it over to the appointed team, to enable it complete the assignment on time, he said.He said in a bid to ensure that the targets are realized, the commission is working with professinals of high integrit. The information-collection mission is on track; this has been done since the first day, he explained further, adding: The task seems too heavy but I assure that you everything will be done on time, and the report will be filed to the Mufti within the set deadline. He said information can be shared to the commission via 0777111122, 0623555551 and the email address tumeyamufti@gmail.com. On the importance of the investigation we are conducting, the committee is asking for moral support from everyone who has documents that can be used to accomplish the given task, he insistedChief Mufti formed the commission with seven terms of reference, including follow-ups on tax exemptions that had been granted to the council, as well as transfer of proprty ownership.Also to be investigated are contracts with tenants and investors, to establish if the council is benefiting, tracking all properties, revenues and expenditure. The report will be submitted to the Chief Mufti within the next sixty days as we believe the work would have been completed by then, he said.
