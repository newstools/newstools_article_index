Dodoma. The government is collaborating with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Tanzania Trade Authority (TanTrade) in the endeavour to find a ready market for honey that is produced in the country, a cabinet minister has said.The Industry, Trade and Investment Minister, Mr Charles Mwijage told the National Assembly earlier today that the honey, produced in Tabora and in other places across the country does meet the required quality standards and hence the need to promote its beyond Tanzania s borders.Responding to questions posed by Mr Emmanuel Mwakasaka (Tabora Urban - CCM) here yesterday, Mr Mwijage said it requires at least $50 million (about Sh110 billion) to set up a processing factory that would turnaround honey producers fortunes.In his question, Mr Mwakasaka wanted to the government to issue an assurance regarding claims and assumptions that Tabora produced honey was not fit for human consumption. With such a processing plant, we can be able to produce 5000 tonnes a week or 260,000 tonnes each year, Mr Mwaijage said
