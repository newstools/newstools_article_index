Dar es Salaam. Tanzania s exports strengthened by 8.4 per cent in the year ending June 30, 2016 as revenue from tourism, manufactured goods and gold improved. The value of the exported goods and services jumped to $10.1 billion in the year ending June 30, 2016 compared with $9.3 billion recorded during a similar period of 2015, according to Bank of Tanzania. A large part of the improvement occurred in travel which is mainly tourism; manufactured goods; and gold, the central bank stated in its economic review for July. Tourism, which is the leading foreign exchange earner, improved from $2.19 billion to $2.27 billion. Gold shipment also improved from $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion during the same period. However, foreign exchange earnings from traditional exports fell to $828 million compared with $907 million generated in the corresponding period in 2015. Traditional exports include cotton, tobacco, coffee, cashew nuts, sisal, tea and cloves. The value of exported manufactured goods grew by 11.1 per cent to $1.46 billion, with a notable improvement in exports of textile, apparel and plastic items. Gold export, which constitutes the largest share of non-traditional exports, recovered slightly amidst subdued prices in the recent period. This time around, it improved by 7.9 per cent to $1.33 billion as a result of increased export volume. Imports of goods and services fell by 15.2 per cent to $11.33 billion in the year ending June 2016. The decline was notable in all goods import, save for fertilisers. A significant decline was recorded in capital goods, oil, and food. The improved performance of non-traditional exports and services, coupled with a decline in imports, particularly oil resulted in the narrowing of the current account to a deficit of $1.88 billion from a deficit $4.34 billion in June 2015.
