Dar es Salaam. Twiga Bancorp is targeting to snatch a share of the business that comes with the existence of traders within the busy Karioako area by opening a branch there, the bank said yesterday.The government-owned financial institution will open the branch the sixth in Dar es Salaam - next week, the chief executive officer (CEO), Mr Cosmas Kimario said yesterday. We have decided to open a branch there because the area has an increasing number of customers who benefit from our loan scheme . We believe the outlet will facilitate the issuance of service to our customers who are largely traders - at the Kariakoo Market, Mr Kimario said.This comes in about two months since the government, through the Treasury Registrar, Mr Lawrence Mafuru, assured Tanzanians regarding the safety of their monies in the financial institution and on Twiga Bancorp s stability in offering its services.The clarifications came following media reports that painted a gloomy picture of the bank s financial position which left uncorrected - would have created needless panic among customers.Mr Mafuru said in July that the government had given directives to Twiga Bancorp to address challenges facing the financial institution pointing out that the bank was in need of capital to strengthen its services. The government is now waiting for technical recommendations to enable the bank to address the challenges, he said, citing at a number of ways through which the government intends to raise additional capital for the bank.
