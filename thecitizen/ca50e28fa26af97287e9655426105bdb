Handeni. In a bid to solve and prevent land conflicts, residents of Kwabojo and Gendagenda villages in Mgambo Ward, Handeni District, have appealed to authorities to educate them on map reading.Speaking during a meeting convened to resolve land disputes, the residents said they were not conversant with map reading and that they still relied on natural boundaries such as river beds, hills and forests separating villages and areas earmarked for various uses.The villagers acknowledged that this was not the best way to demarcate boundaries between the villages and cultivated fields or areas set aside for grazing or conservation. They said they were not conversant with map reading.Abdallah Haji from Kwabojo cited a land conflict which had dragged on between his village and neighbouring Gendagenda since 1996 as they were not sure of the proper borderline separating the two settlements.A district official in charge of infrastructure, economic and environment projects, Mr Mustafa Beleko, blamed the land conflicts in the area to the violation of the laws and rampant selling of land without following the official procedures.
