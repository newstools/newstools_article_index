Dodoma. The government does not have immediate plans to open an embassy in South Sudan, according to deputy Minister for Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries William Ole Nasha. This is despite the fact that South Sudan offers great potential for Tanzanians. Mr Ole Nasha told the Parliament earlier today that with South Sudan becoming member of the East African Community (EAC), it offered many opportunities for Tanzania to exploit, noting, however, that the decision would only be reached when the government gets money to do so. While preparations are still ongoing, South Sudan s joining of the EAC offers many benefits in business and other sectors of the economy so Tanzanians must start exploiting the same even without an embassy there .it should be understood that although we see the benefits, the decision to open an embassy will only be reached when we get funds, he said. Mr Ole Nasha was responding to Mr Cosato Chumi (Mafinga Urban-CCM) on behalf of the minister for Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Dr Augustine Mahiga.
