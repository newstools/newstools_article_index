The cocky look of suspenders has transformed from an essential male clothing to a teenage fashion statement. Right now suspenders rock with jeans, especially skinny jeans for the daring girls. Plain or dotted with cartoon characters, these braces are making a comeback slowly but surely. For men if you want to do something different to your trousers then spruce them up with comfortably fitting suspenders. Do remember they look great on shorts and miniskirts too. Although the item is expected to hold the outfit up, do not be surprised to see the young and restless opting for the braces to hang loose at their sides. It is all part of the cool look.
