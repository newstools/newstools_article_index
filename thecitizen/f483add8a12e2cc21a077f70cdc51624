Dar es Salaam. Taifa Stars central defender Kelvin Yondani may face a snub in Charles Mkwasa s next selection after failing to honour his call-up to the national team.Yondani s no-show has left Mkwasa with two centre-backs only namely; David Mwantika and Vincent Andrew.Stars, who flew to Lagos last night, take on Nigeria at Akwa Ibom Stadium on Saturday in their final 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) group G qualifying match.Victory for Stars will boost their psyche ahead the 2016 Cecafa Challenge Cup having missed out of the 2017 Afcon billed for Gabon early next year.Mkwasa, who replaced Mart Nooij last year, will be keeping his fingers crossed for Mwantika and Andrew to finish the Saturday s match unscathed.Questioned on why the Young Africans man did not report at the camp, Mkwasa said he had no clue. I know nothing about his failure to turn up at the camp. I expected that he would report on Monday evening, but didn t and was not available on his phone, said Mkwasa as his 18-member squad prepared for departure.It remains to be seen how Mkwasa will react should it be known that he made himself unavailable for the Super Eagles dead rubber.Yanga insiders told The Citizen that Yondani, who did not travel to DR Congo for their Confederation Cup match against TP Mazembe, has trained just once before going missing. He trained with teammates before the match against African Lyon; thereafter we did not see him and since then, he is not reachable on his telephone, said the insider who sought anonymity.Yanga head coach Hans van der Pluijm declined to comment on Yondani no-show saying it was a management issue. After several futile attempts to reach the 31-year-old defender, the Tanzania Football Federation technical bench opted to omit him from the list of players who flew to Lagos. Meanwhile; Yanga secretary general intimated to this paper that Yondani has family issues to settle. Yondani will return to training soon. He has family issues to sort out, said Deusdedit.Meanwhile, in a mark of solidarity, the Akwa Ibom State Government has declared the Afcon qualifier match between Nigeria and Tanzania free for football enthusiasts to watch.Although the qualifier match will not see Nigeria to the Afcon fiesta, the State Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Monday Ukoh, said yesterday that the state government decided to throw the gate open for fans to cheer the Super Eagles to victory.
