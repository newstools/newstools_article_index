Dar es Salaam. The Kinondoni Municipal Council has incurred a loss of about Sh4 billion after government s decision to repossess 33 hectares in Magomeni. This was revealed by Kinondoni Municipal mayor Boniface Jacob yesterday at a press conference. Council had planned to build a multi-billion residential and commercial complex. The mayor said Sh2 billion, which was provided by the World Bank, through the Dar es Salaam Metropolitan Development Project (DMDP), was used for the project s structural design. According to him, the money was paid to Gulfgrip Company only four months ago. The demolition of residential houses and clearing of the project s site gobbled Sh1 billion, he said. At least Sh700 million was used to pay 12-month rent for 644 tenants, who were forcibly evicted to pave the way for the implementation of the project. Mr Jacob defended the Municipal Council from any wrongdoing saying the project failed to take off since 2011, when the tenants were evicted, because the minister responsible for Regional Administration and Local Government didn t authorise its implementation. We already had a mega real-estate structure and we were only waiting for approval from the minister to start the implementation of the project, he said. In another development, Mr Jacob said Hamburg City Council had pulled out from financing the construction of a waste recycling plant in Mabwepande. In January this year, Kinondoni and Hamburg signed an agreement in which the latter promised to give Sh3.5 billion for the construction of the project. However, Mr Jacob said Hamburg pulled out of the project after the government refused to exempt the company from paying tax.
