Dar es Salaam. National cricket team coach Khalil Rehemtullah has said that they have gained enough experience from the ICC Africa Under-19 World Cup Qualifiers-Division 2 despite a poor show.Rehemtullah defended his team saying the local cricketers have potential but need time for building so as to put up good performances. Building up a team is a long term process, it needs patience and determination. My team has a cream of young determinant players who will be the force to reckon with in the coming international events, said Rehemtullah. I think we need to have regular regional tournaments to reinforce our teams as the Western African sides do, he said.Western African teams proved their prowess against the eastern Africa sides, Tanzania and Rwanda.Tanzania finished sixth out of seven teams that participated in the qualifiers, after beating their fellow East Africans, Rwanda.Rwanda came last without a single win, but their coach Eddy Mugarula says that the East African cricketers have more potential, but they lack regular training schedules. We do not play cricket regularly back in our countries, but we have more talented players. Despite our setbacks, I believe Tanzania and Rwanda will be among serious contenders in the long run. What I believe now is that we are in the process of building our teams. My team, for-example, has only four experienced players who featured in the 2014 qualifiers in Lusaka, Zambia, but the rest who took part in this year s qualifiers are new, said Mugarula.He said there were no regular cricket tournaments in Rwanda as most of his players were recruited from inter-schools sports programmes.Ghana and Botswana emerged top winners to secure qualifications for the Africa Division 1.Meanwhile, congratulatory messages have poured in for Ghana and Botswana s triumph at the qualifiers.Francis Trevor Samura, who is chief executive officer (CEO) of Code de I voire Cricket sent his messages to the Africa regional cricket body based in South Africa for Ghana and Botswana s triumph.In his message, Samura said it has been one of the best organised Africa tournaments with exciting cricket.On behalf of Sierra Leone, he hailed the two teams for their progression to Africa Division 1, wishing them a success.Justine Ligyalingi, who is the CEO of Uganda cricket said that apart from congratulating the two winning teams, he believes the rest of other countries, including Tanzania has got things to learn from the qualifiers.
