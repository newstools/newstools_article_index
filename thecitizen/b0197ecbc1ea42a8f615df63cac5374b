Dar es Salaam. Presidents Jacob Zuma of South Africa and Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya yesterday sent messages of condolences to President John Magufuli following Saturday s earthquake that left at least 16 people dead and more than 200 injured. The people of South Africa share the pain and loss of the loved ones, their homes and property, and our thoughts and prayers go out to all the affected families. We also wish the injured a speedy recovery, President Zuma said in his message.President Kenyatta telephoned Dr Magufuli and offered to send a planeload of relief and assist in recovery efforts. I have learnt with deep sorrow and regret the loss of sixteen precious lives, injury to hundreds of our Tanzanian brothers and sisters, as well massive destruction of property and livelihoods following the devastating earthquake in Bukoba, Mr Kenyatta said. On behalf of the Government and the people of Kenya, and on my own behalf, I extend heartfelt condolences and sympathies to Your Excellency, the Government and people of Tanzania, and particularly to the grieving families. President Kenyatta said the Kenyan government would dispatch iron sheets, blankets and mattresses, which would be ferried to Tanzania today by a Kenya Defence Forces plane.The 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck at 3.27pm on Saturday, and the worst affected region was Kagera, where hundreds of buildings and other structures were destroyed or damaged. The powerful earthquake was also felt in Mwanza and Mara regions.A strong aftershock sparked panic on Sunday night in Bukoba. Thousands of people spent the night in the open for fear of more aftershocks.The epicentre of the earthquake was Nsunga Village, near the Ugandan border, about 40 kilometres northwest of Bukoba.The Geological Society of Tanzania (GST) said it was impossible to predict with certainty whether more aftershocks were on the way. We cannot predict whether more tremors will happen because the technology to accurately predict earthquakes does not exist yet, GST said in a statement.It added that the magnitude of Saturday s earthquake was high enough to cause the kind of destruction and loss of life witnessed in Bukoba.The earthquake was relatively shallow, originating about 10 kilometres below the surface, and the likely cause was a collision of the Earth s tectonic plates within the western arm of the Great Rift Valley, according to GST.Geologists have been dispatched to Bukoba to study the nature and aftermath of Saturday s earthquake.It was the strongest and most destructive earthquake to have been registered in Tanzania s recent history.Eyewitness accounts said the earthquake was initially felt as a vibration of the ground, prompting many people in Bukoba and its environs to think that it was caused by heavy construction machinery.It was only when the ground started to shake violently and topple buildings that people realised that it was an earthquake.A few hours after Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa led hundreds of people in paying their last respects to the victims at Kaitaba Stadium, a strong aftershock rocked Bukoba, forcing residents to flee their houses and spend the night outside.President Magufuli cancelled a trip to Zambia following the disaster. He was due to attend the swearing in of Mr Edgar Lungu as Zambia s president after his re-election last month.Dr Magufuli will be represented at today s ceremony by Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan.
