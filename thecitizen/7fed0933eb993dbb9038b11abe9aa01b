Dar es Salaam. Preparations for the seventh edition of the Rock City Marathon received a major boost yesterday after the National Microfinance Bank (NMB) injected Sh10 million.The marathon event, which is growing by leaps and bounds, will take place in Mwanza on September 25 with thousands of competitors expected.NMB acting chief retail banking Boma Raballa told reporter yesterday that his institution has decided to support the Rock City Marathon as part of their corporate social activities.Raballa said they have set aside over Sh1 billion for such events this year. We have been sponsoring different sporting events like football, hockey and athletics for many years and we feel obliged to support social development, said Raballa. We are extremely happy to be associated with the Rock City Marathon, which has been acting as a platform for our runners excellence besides helping expose their talents. According to him, their sponsorship in athletics and other events will be helpful in preparing the Tanzanian athletes ahead of major international showpieces. We had Olympic Games held in Brazil recently with one of our athletes (Felix Simbu) finishing in the top five. We believe that by supporting such tournaments, we will be contributing in grooming world beaters, he said.Capital Plus International (event organisers) official Mathew Kasonta expressed his appreciation to the NMB, saying their support has come at the right time.He said the purpose of the annual race was not only to act as a platform of unearthing talents, but also to promote tourist attractions through sport. Mwanza is blessed with several tourist attractions, which we believe will be promoted because a lot of foreign runners will participate in the race, said Kasonta.According to him, the event will feature the 21-kilometre race for men and women, and 5km race for people with albinism.This will serve to raise awareness of the people so they stop the killings of albinos due to superstitious beliefs.
