Dar es Salaam. The government said Tuesday it would soon import a consignment of tetanus toxoid vaccine to address a countrywide shortage.Reports of the critical shortage of the vaccine have in the recent past raised concern at health centres across the country s 30 regions.In Kigoma Regional Medical Officer Paul Chaote, told The Citizen this week the current stock would last only two months. Normally, there should be enough vaccines for at least three months, but what we currently have in stock will last only two months, he said.Tetanus is a life-threatening bacterial disease whereby the germs enter the body through open wounds. In an interview with The Citizen, a Dar es Salaam-based motorcyclist, Mr Martin Owen, said he recently failed to get the vaccine at Amana Hospital where doctors recommended it following a road accident.He said: I was told the vaccine was out of stock. I received other services except the vaccine. I was referred to Muhimbili National Hospital but it was same story. Dr Dafrosa Lyimo, the Immunisation and Vaccines Development Programme (IVDP) manager in the Ministry of Health said: It usually takes some time to import the vaccines, but we have already negotiated with the Medical Stores Department (MSD). They have assured us we will receive the consignment in the coming months. A report by the Ministry of Health, Community development, Gender, Children and the Elderly, says the country needs Sh120 billion to maintain adequate stocks of TT vaccines annually. The government contributes Sh16 billion, while donors contribute the rest.According to Dr Lyimo, the vaccine is also crucial in reducing maternal mortality. Health experts say all expectant mothers and their newborn babies need to be protected against tetanus. We know that during delivery the infant can easily be infected, said Dr Lyimo.
