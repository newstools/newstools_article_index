We have less than three days before we face Simba. It is a big match considering that they have also started the league well, said the 27-year-old marksman. However, we have a high morale after a fine run of form, so I can t see them walking away unscathed on Saturday. They must be caged. Azam and Simba tie on everything at the top the table, but the former enjoy the first place courtesy of their initial letter. We got maximum points from our Mbeya trip and now we are plotting the points at stake in the next match. The team is gelling quite well and there no doubt that we will produce the best performance this weekend, he said via the club s official portal.Bocco boasts an impressive scoring record against both Young Africans and Simba in various competitions. The 1.9-metre striker has so far scored 12 goals in their matches against Yanga while plundering 18 goals against Simba. I have always delivered whenever playing Simba and Yanga. It is my belief that I will be on the score sheet again this weekend. I am mentally sound and so are my teammates, he said. Azam and Simba played out a two-all draw in the first round of the previous round with Bocco scoring a brace as Ibrahim Ajibu scored for Simba. Bocco, who has led the Chamazi side to every success, jointly tops the league s scoring chart with three goals together with Simba s Laudit Mavugo, Rafael Daudi (Mbeya City), and Hood Mayanja (African Lyon).
