Dar es Salaam. Oil prices have continued to fall in Tanzania. This is because global oil prices are declining.The Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (Ewura) announced that effective yesterday retail prices for petrol, diesel and kerosene decreased by Sh31, Sh114 and Sh234 per litre respectively.Ewura director general Felix Ngamlagosi said wholesale petrol, diesel and kerosene prices fell by Sh34.41, Sh116.63 and Sh236.65 per litre respectively.However, he said since there was no petrol and diesel consignment at the Tanga Port, the decline in prices was not applicable in Tanga.Instead, the same indicative prices announced last month would be applicable there.
