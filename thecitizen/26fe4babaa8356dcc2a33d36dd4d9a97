We expect the factory to be completed and start production by 2018 while at the same time construction of the new factory continues the old one will be improved to increase its production in the process, we will be creating jobs for Tanzanians, said Mr Erio in a statement that was e-mailed to The Citizen yesterday.Both parties stand to benefit from the venture.According to Mr Minja, apart from its collaboration with PPF, the Prisons Service was looking up to other investment avenues in areas of minerals and buildings in Dodoma.He called upon PPF and other institutional and individual investors to tap into the opportunities especially during this period that the government was shifting to Dodoma.
