Dar es Salaam. Investigations into whether Sh48.4 billion wharfage fees were stolen at the Dar es Salaam Port are yet to be completed.A team to probe into the matter was launched six months ago.Transport permanent secretary Leonard Chamuriho told The Citizen that the matter was still being handled by police and the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) board.
