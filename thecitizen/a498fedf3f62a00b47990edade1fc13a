Johannesburg. Tanzania s remote chance of qualifying for the Division 1 at the ICC Under-19 World Cup Qualifiers for Africa -Division 2 went up in smoke yesterday after tumbling to their third successive defeat yesterday.The Tanzanian boys had promised to bounce back and march on to qualification, but their hopes were false as they suffered a 61-run defeat at the hands of Botswana.The good news is that Tanzania will remain in Division 2 and will try their luck in the next edition, which will be held at the same venues.Tanzania will play Ghana tomorrow before taking on Rwanda, who have also lost all matches, on Saturday. They will sign off with a date against Nigeria a day later.Botswana won the toss and elected to bat first, and went to score 216/6 before the Tanzanian cricketers responded by scoring 155 all out in 34 overs.Despite assurance from their coach Khalil Rehemtulah that the boys had improved, but batting remained to be their Achilles heel as there was no big sign of improvement.Tanzania was two wickets down just in the second over with a zero-run score.Despite their general poor batting, Wilbert Mollel and Mohammed Omar put up praiseworthy performance to reduce the loss margin.Had it not been for losing about four early wickets with just 24 runs in eight overs, Tanzania could have easily chased down the 216 score mark set by Botswana.Botswana, who have so far bagged four points after beating winless Rwanda on Tuesday, were good at bowling, thus denying Tanzania runs.Rehemtullah blamed the defeat on his batsmen who could not play according to the game plan, but lauded individual progress of his cricketers. It s is new team in such a high-profile tournament. All of the players with the exception of our captain are making their debut. We can t heap blame them, but we lost our games because of our poor batting, said the coach after the match. I believe that they will learn a lot from this tournament and will come back stronger in the next edition.
