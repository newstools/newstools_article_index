Arusha. Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) says it has not set standards for specially-converted vehicles ferrying tourists along the country s rough terrains to the national parks and other attractions.A senior official of the government body who asked not to be named gave the clarification here last week following reports that a Moshi-based automobile engineering firm, RSA Limited, claimed the copyright for re-designed tourist vans.The official said TBS has not issued any certification on vehicles modified by the company. The elongated bodies of the vehicles allow more tourists to be carried per car. We don t issue certification to products or goods that have been certified internationally and already in the global market, the official clarified noting that local automobile firms were at liberty to modify the imported vehicles to suit their needs.He added that TBS would not interfere with this as long as the vehicles were road worthy and as long as the modifications do not infringe the copyright of the original makers. If there are problems with this, it is the original makers who have to complain if they note that the modification does not comply with their set standards. Not us, he said.However, he elaborated that the Bureau would follow up complaints raised by the Moshi company that its artistic designs and drawings and related copyright had been infringed by other companies which have redesigned their tourist vehicles using their RSA model safari vehicles.In recent months, there has been a tug of war between RAS and the Arusha-based Hanspaul Automechs (HAL) over the said vehicles.According to TBS, none of the two motor firms have been given the copyright to design the said vehicles.
