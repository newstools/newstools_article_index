After an impressive show this year s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in the men s marathon, Tanzania s long distance runner Felix Simbu has turned focus to next year s IAAF World Championship in London.Simbu says he is targeting yet another spectacular participation in the London championship.Simbu is among three Tanzanian marathoners who represented the country at this year s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.He made a spectacular participation in the Rio Games as he finished fifth in the men s marathon.He narrowly missed a medal to restore the country s dented pride in major athletics competitions.Fibert Bayi and Suleiman Nyambui won bronze medals in the Stipple Chase and 5000 meters respectively in the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The country s efforts to repeat that memorable feat have always ended miserably. I am now in serious preparations for next year s World Championship, much determined to do well, said Simbu, who made his Olympic participation debut in Brazil. I have been much encouraged by my great performance in the Brazil Olympics, he said.
