Kigali. President Paul Kagame has joined a growing list of world leaders that have endorsed World Bank president, Jim Yong, for a second term after his tenure at the top ended in June.In what appeared as a well played strategic move, Kagame announced his endorsement together with President of Benin Patrice Talon during his official visit to Rwanda.Both leaders painted a glowing picture of the South Korean, praising him for being committed to the progress and stabilization of the great lakes region since assuming office in 2012. He (Yong) is passionate about the work at hand. We fully support him, Kagame told a press conference, with Talon adding that: Dr Kim merits our trust. This is an opportunity to express our support to his candidacy. A statement from the Rwanda government today said that both Rwanda and Benin recognize the achievements of Dr. Kim during the last four years, noting that he has strived to make the World Bank a partner of choice for African countries . Under Dr. Kim s leadership, the Bank has shown unwavering commitment to stabilization and progress of the Great Lakes Region through regional projects bringing together governments and the private sector.The Bank also took the lead in the response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, through a multinational, multifaceted and localized approach, the statement reads. The World Bank currently runs 12 national projects in Rwanda with net commitment of $881 million, and five regional projects valued at $119 million.As of March 2016, the World Bank approved $4.27 billion in lending to 51 projects in Sub Saharan Africa.But under Mr Yong s tenure, Sub-Saharan Africa s growth slowed to 3.0% in 2015, down from 4.5% in 2014, which is the weakest pace since 2009.He has also received endorsements from the US, Germany and China, and has been described as a lightning rod for the World Bank by the Financial Times.Mr Yong s biggest challenge so far has come from his own staff.
