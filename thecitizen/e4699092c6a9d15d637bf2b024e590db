Dar es Salaam. The government has been advised to give high priority to more knowledge-intensive production to transform the manufacturing sector.The call has come at a time when the government has announced plans to industrialise Tanzania by 2020.Confederation of Tanzania Industries (CTI) chairman Samuel Nyantahe told BusinessWeek that they have come up with recommendations that will be discussed by stakeholders on the imperatives of fast tracking industrialization in Tanzania.He said it was imperative to analyse the structure and composition of imports both in physical as well as in value terms as a basis of prioritisation of what to produce in Tanzania according to capital and skills requirement for industrialization.The analysis will form a major input to the subsequent prioritization process in deciding what to be manufactured locally as well as identification of manufacturers, processors and champions who will lead the process. Product prioritisation is necessary because Tanzania cannot produce everything given the capital and skills requirement for industrialisation, Dr Nyantahe said.He stressed that the process of prioritisation must be based on criteria such as the comparative and competitive advantage as well as the identification of markets, skills, competence, strength and technology.He said CTI recommends that the government supports private-public partnerships (PPPs) in various key areas such as infrastructure.He said the government should establish or strengthen pro- industrial financial institutions such as TIB, Industrial Development Bank, SMEs Development Bank, Agricultural Development Bank.He would like the government to establish national and regional industrial hubs in Kibaha, Morogoro, Tanga, Moshi, Arusha, Mwanza, Kigoma, Shinyanga, Njombe, Mbeya, Iringa, Singida and Mtwara.According to him, industries for agricultural farm equipment, fertiliser production for natural gas, Minjingu phosphate and other useful inputs as well as agro-processing factories are vital.However he said high on the agenda for action is waging the war on corruption to create a level playing field for local industries to promote fair competition in the economy. The government should identify and promote value-added industrial products and moving up the value chain in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, forest products and mineral resources. The objective is to make the economy self-supporting by prioritising value addition in the current low value primary products. He stressed that Tanzania s industrialisation is impossible without commercialising agriculture and or agro-industries because of the importance of agriculture.Moreover, massive infrastructure improvements in energy and transport are needed to support the envisaged industrialisation.He said there is need to ensure drivers of industrialisation are in place and linked including both hard Infrastructure such as power and transport including roads, railways, ports, air and water and soft infrastructure such as human resources and skills, finance.He said there should be specialised financing for industrial development, markets and political will as well as government commitment.Regarding hard infrastructure, he said that Tanzania is challenged by a significant infrastructure deficit, with the level of access to and quality of its infrastructure insufficient to facilitate the desired pace of industrialization. Except for major trunk roads, Tanzania s level of access to infrastructure and the quality of this infrastructure is worse than that of its neighbors, he said.
