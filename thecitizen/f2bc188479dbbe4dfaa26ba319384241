Dar es Salaam. President John Magufuli on Friday told the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) to stop day dreaming as there will not be another round of elections in Zanzibar until 2020.Delivering a speech in Pemba on Friday, Dr Magufuli reiterated that elections have been concluded and Dr Ali Mohammed Shein emerged victorious. The next General Election in Zanzibar will be held in 2020. This is the truth and nothing will change it, said Dr Magufuli.The remarks were a reaction to CUF leaders crisscrossing the world in July in a bid to convince the international community that CCM cheated in the last General Election.CUF secretary general Seif Sharrif Hamad visited the US, Canada and Europe and met with various parties, democratic institutions and prominent personalities.He also visited The Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC) claiming that the Opposition party had compiled evidence of government abuse of democracy and human rights. In a speech broadcast live by Zanzibar Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) and monitored in Dar es Salaam, Dr Magufuli warned individuals and institutions with ill motives. He said he will stop at nothing to ensure that such people were put on check. If they want to play with me I will make sure that I make them play a dance which they don t know, he said adding: I will make sure Zanzibar and entire Tanzania continue to be peaceful and I promise to deal with whoever tries to disturb it.
