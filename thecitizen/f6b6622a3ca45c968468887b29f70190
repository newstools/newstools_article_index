Dar es Salaam. Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) and Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority (Tazara) have vowed to work closely in a bid to enhance efficiency and offer cost-effective services to customers.During a meeting held in Dar es Salaam recently, the heads of the two authorities, Mr Deusdedit Kakoko of TPA and Mr Bruno Ching andu of Tazara agreed to hold regular consultative meetings focusing on information-sharing and strategising efficient cargo handling. We call upon all stakeholders to offer seamless transport services in order to reduce transport costs and transit times for assured business on the Dar es Salaam Corridor Route, Mr Kakoko said during the meeting.Mr Ching wandu noted that it is in the interest and vision of both parties to see cargo from the port transported along a vibrant railway network. The vision calls for closer co-operation between all stakeholders in the transport chain, he said.Presently 99.7 per cent of all cargo from the port of Dar es Salaam is transported by road compared to 0.3 per cent transported by rail and is not very economical.Transit traffic at Dar es Salaam port accounts for 34 per cent of the total, and Zambia is the first transit customer whose traffic cargo has been growing from 1,830,005.00 in 2014 to 1,903,979.00 in 2015.The meeting was also attended by the CEO of Mofed, a Zambian government owned clearing firm, Mr David Chimfwembe.
