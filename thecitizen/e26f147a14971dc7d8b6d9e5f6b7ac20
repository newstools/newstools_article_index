Dar es Salaam. Effective transport policies must result in transformative changes for rural women with multiple and intersectional vulnerabilities, says HelpAge International as it launches a study on the impacts and implications of gender mainstreaming in the rural transport sector in Tanzania.The study which will collect evidence on how women with multi-layered vulnerabilities are benefiting from gender sensitive transport policies will be conducted in Kilolo and Kibaha districts. We have identified recent transport infrastructure projects in the two targeted districts. We will assess the extent to which they have applied gender inclusive strategies and if these have been transformative, particularly, to women of all ages facing gender, age, disability related discrimination and exclusion, said Amleset Tewodros, Country Director, HelpAge International Tanzania.The study which, funded by UK Aid, is a follow-on to two previous research programmes Learning with older people on their transport and Mobility problems in rural Tanzania will analyse and recommend frameworks, goals, targets and indicators to measure explicitly the transformative dimensions of gender policy to ensure they include and benefit those most vulnerable.In 2003, Tanzania adopted a national transport policy and mainstreamed gender in rural transport. The policy recognised that women spent 75 per cent of their time walking long distances to and from their farms, adversely affecting their productivity. It also acknowledged that women are over-represented amongst the poor and face greater difficulty in moving out of poverty circles.There is an implicit assumption that consideration of gender issues in transport programmes will benefit and empower women of all ages and abilities in rural areas to access employment opportunities, markets and public social services such as health care
