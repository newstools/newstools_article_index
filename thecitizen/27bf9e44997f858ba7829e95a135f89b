Mwanza. Two years ago, Ms Leah Solea fled her home in Lyabukande Village, following death threats from members of her community. Her crime -- she was accused of killing her husband.There is no evidence linking her to the death, but the allegations are centered on superstitious beliefs.For 24 months now, Ms Solea has not had a home. She spends nights on a shop verandah at the Bwiru Bus Terminus in Mwanza city. I have no place to call home anymore, I feel so insecure. But sleeping on this shop verandah is much safer than staying in the village, the 61-year-old says.A mother of four, Ms Solea believes the people behind her banishment were out to grab the family land. Some of the people who threatened me are my own family members, she tells The Citizen as she collects her sack-cum-mattress.Scavenging food from dust bins and asking for alms across the street -has been her life ever since she was forced out of the village.About 109 elderly people were killed in the Lake Zone between 2012 and 2014 in superstition-related murders, according to the former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Mr John Mngondo.Public witchcraft accusations have been illegal since the British Witchcraft Ordinance of 1928. The law remains largely unchanged. But government efforts to stop superstition-related killings have been unsuccessful.In the late 1970s, 897 individuals suspected of carrying out witch killings were arrested.In a related incident Ms Amina Kundi, 60, recently fled Nyag holongo Village in Bukombe District to Mwanza City, narrowly escaping assault by irate villagers accusing her of witchcraft.Two weeks before she left, an elderly couple from her village was hacked to death on July 22. Geita Police Commander Isack Msengi identified the victims as Machene Magita, 80, and his wife Genke Bundala, 75. Living in the streets of Mwanza is safer than being in the village. The only challenge here is getting food and proper shelter, Ms Kundi said.
