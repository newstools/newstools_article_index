Banjul. A women s rights activist in the Gambia currently campaigning against female genital mutilation has said she will put herself forward as the country s first-ever female presidential candidate. It is true that I want to contest the presidency in December s election, Isatou Touray told AFP ahead of an official announcement expected later Friday.She said she would stand as an independent candidate in the polls, expected to hand incumbent Yahya Jammeh a fifth term at the helm of the poor west African nation.Now in her sixties, Touray has had a colourful career, winning a US State Department award for empowering Gambian communities in 2008 but arrested in 2010 over corruption allegations when she was deputy director of the Gambia s development institute. She was acquitted of all charges. Ms Touray is currently executive director of leading women s group the Gambia Committee against Harmful Traditional Practices, which fights to stop female genital mutilation.Meanwhile on Thursday, the United Democratic Party (UDP) -- the country s principal opposition movement -- named relatively unknown businessman Adama Barrow as its candidate.Several of the party s leading figures are currently serving jail time for holding public protests, catapulting the UDP acting treasurer into the spotlight.
