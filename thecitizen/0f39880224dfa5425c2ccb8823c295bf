Moshi. The health care system and society at large have been cautioned to take special care of psychiatric patients as mental health cases are no the rise.According to the head of Psychiatric Unit at the Mawenzi regional hospital Dr. Engelbetrus Mafikiri, the number of people suffering from psychiatric problems is rising particularly among secondary and university students.The official attributed the rise to increased drug use among the youth.He added that the government-run Mawenzi hospital in the heart of Moshi receives about 800 to 1,000 psychiatric cases each week.Tuspo secretary general Pangarasi Msongore said many still have to come to terms with the gravity of the problem.He cited cases in which people with mental illness are confined at their homes by their relatives as their mental illnesses are considered a curse by many.
