I think our only challenge is that we are playing against a team we have no information about. They started from the second stage and we did not secure their video footages, he said.The coach believes the team is becoming better with every match in their overall development. Our target is to win, we call on all Tanzanians to come in their numbers at the National Stadium and give us support, we want to see the stadium fully. I am sure this will inspire our players.
