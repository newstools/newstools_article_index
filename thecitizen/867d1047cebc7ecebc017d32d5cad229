Arusha. Huge gas discoveries in Tanzania and Mozambique will be a subject of intense interest among the global energy industry players during the fourth East African Oil and Gas Summit (EAOGS) slated for Nairobi in November this year.Also expected to feature in the discussions are significant oil discoveries in Uganda and Kenya. Uganda will export its crude oil overseas through a pipeline to be built from Hoima in western part of the country to Tanga port.Organisers of the meeting to be held from November 15 to 17 say there are indications East African nations were already in the race to become major oil and gas producers in the African continent. The speed at which governments in East Africa are developing hydrocarbon reserves is a clear indication of their will to cement the region s reputation as the new hot spot in hydrocarbon exploration and production , said Mr Reuben Kyama of the Nairobi-based One World Public Relations, one of the coordinators.While oil production will start anytime in Uganda, Kenya has announced that the government has brought forward the country s oil production deadline by two years and set a path that will enable the country to become a major producer and exporter by 2019.
