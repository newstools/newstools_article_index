Simiyu. Regional Magistrate court has released on bail Chadema deputy secretary general (Isles) Salum Mwalimu and 18 others after they spent over 12 days in custody.Mr Mwalimu and his colleagues were arrested on August 26, this year for alleged contempt of police order not to hold political meetings as well as inciting wananchi against their government.The Prosecution requested the court not to grant bail to the accused by arguing that they would continue to commit the same offence.However, the regional resident magistrate, Mr John Mkwabi, threw out the prosecution request after he heard from both sides. I agree with the defense that the affidavit from the prosecution has some legal shortcomings; one of the legal deficits is that the affidavit comes from Regional Crime Officer but it was signed by Acting RCO, ruled Mr Mkwabi.The magistrate also added that the prosecution has failed to prove to the court that if the accused will be set free on bail they will not continue to violate the law. Security at the court was tightened as Mr Mwalimu and co were arraigned. Chadema national chairman mr Freeman Mbowe led paty leaders to the court.The accused were required to have two sureties each who will sign a Sh3 million bond. All the accused met the requirements.
