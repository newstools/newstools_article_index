Dar es Salaam. Geita Gold Mine (GGM) has said that it does not condone any form of corruption.GGM communications manager Mr Tenga Tenga yesterday said that the mine has been conducting its operation honestly in compliance with the laws and regulations of the country.He said any form of corruption unacceptable and will not be tolerated.He said that last week the mine was made aware that the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau filed charges against an employee of the mine for soliciting bribe. Our human resource office has been charged with making a sexual advance in exchange for employment. This is against company policy guides and reinforces ethical conduct of its employees, contractors and consultants by providing zero tolerance to corruption. This is against our policy as we do not entertain such behaviours, he stressed. In view of this, he said that GGM takes the charges seriously and will cooperate with law enforcers to ensure that justice is done.
