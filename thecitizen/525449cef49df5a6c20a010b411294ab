Dar es Salaam. The Medical Stores Department (MSD) could fail to supply drugs and medical equipment to public hospitals as the government has not paid Sh143 billion.MSD Director General Laurean Bwanakunu expressed this concern during an interview with The Citizen in his office on Thursday.He urged the government to clear the debt to enable the major supplier to public health facilities meet its obligations effectively.Mr Bwanakunu also admitted that there is an acute shortage of cancer drugs, which have partly been caused by government debt. He said cancer drugs are very expensive and MSD needs huge amounts of money to buy them. The arrangement is that we pay 80 per cent as advance to our suppliers and clear the remaining sum after the consignment is delivered, he said.
