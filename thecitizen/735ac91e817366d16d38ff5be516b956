Dar es Salaam. Muslim faithful and other residents in the city were forced to pay Sh8000 for a kilogramme of meat instead of Sh6000 yesterday as traders capitalised on the celebration of Eid-ul-adha to raise the price .A survey conducted by The Citizen in various parts of the city, including Vingunguti abattoir, established that the number of goat slaughtered was higher than on normal days.A meat inspector at Vingunguti abattoir Joseph Lukiko said the number of goat and cows slaughtered had almost doubled.He said a total of 689 cows and 365 goats were slaughtered compared to 383 and 350 respectively, which were slaughtered the previous day. We have been forced to increase the price from Sh4500 to Sh6,500 per a kilogramme due to the rise in demand because of the Eid-ul-adha celebrations, Mr Lukiko said.He explained, however, that price would subsequently drop to the normal level from today.Mr Lukiko explained that the government collected Sh3.9 million through revenues yesterday.Some traders said they were forced to increase the price of meat following a decision by abattoir operators to raise the wholesale price. We have increased the price from Sh6,000 to Sh8000 per a kilogramme for retailers because the price has gone up at the wholesale market, said Mr Jumanne Mzengo, a butchery owner at Vingunguti.Some consumers complained about the decision by butchery owners to raise the price.They said the compelled to buy the meat at the inflated price becausde they had no option. I was shocked when my son returned home without beef, saying the price had increased, said Ms Mwamini Shaaban, a Temeke resident. I had no option but to give him extra money, Ms Shaaban added.
