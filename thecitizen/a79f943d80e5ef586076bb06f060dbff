Dar es Salaam. Mwananchi Communications Limited (MCL) yesterday contributed Sh10 million to the National Assembly Fund established for purposes of collecting donations for assisting victims of Kagera earthquake.Apart from MCL, Jubilee Health Insurance and National Health Insurance fund (NHIF) also donated Sh5 million each.The money was contributed through a match which the Parliament has organised pitting Members of Parliament who support soccer giants in the country -- Simba and Yanga.Law makers supporting the two teams will clash today at the National Stadium whereas collections from the match would be channelled to assisting the September 10 earthquake victims.Speaking during the hand over ceremony, MCL managing director Francis Nanai said being a company which has been working closely with Tanzanians, his firm has seen it fit to also take part in assisting earthquake victims. In addition to this money, we are also going to provide advertising space for institutions which will coordinate donations to assist the victims of the disaster, he said, adding: As a company we wish to contribute in everyway we can to assist our fellow Tanzanians. MCL publishes The Citizen, Mwananchi and Mwanaspoti as well as runs several online and digital platforms.Bunge Sports Club chairman William Ngeleja (Sengerema CCM) said that the Club has organised the match in a bid to assist the victims. As Members of Parliament we have decided to organise the match in order to bring together Tanzanians and raise funds for their fellow Tanzanians in Kagera Region. Given the magnitude of the disaster, the government alone cannot do enough to assist the victims, that is why we have decided to chip in, he said.He said in addition to the MPs match, there will also be a curtain raiser between Bongo Movie and Bongo flava artistes.Mr Ngeleja said that the match was another move by the law makers to assist Kagera earthquake victims as they donated their one day allowance during the just ended Parliamentary sitting in Dodoma.Kagera Region was hit by a 5.7 magnitude earthquake on September 10, which killed at least 19 people, injured hundreds others. It also rendered thousands of houses inhabitable.
