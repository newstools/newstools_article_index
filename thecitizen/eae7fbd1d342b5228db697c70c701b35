Dar es Salaam. Ghanaian defender Daniel Amoah will make his debut for Azam FC on September 7 when the Ice Cream Makers date Tanzania Prisons at the Sokoine Stadium in Mbeya Region.Apart from Amoah, who joined the club from Medeama FC of Ghana, the team is also set to use their Cote d Ivoire defender Serge Pascal Wawa who has not played since May this year due to an injury.Azam FC chief executive officer Saad Kawemba confirmed Amoah s readiness to help stir the Dar es Salaam-based club seeking to claim a top spot in the Vodacom Premier League.The Ghanain was given a holiday and could not play for the team in both the Community Shield encounter against Young Africans, and league games against African Lyon and Majimaji of Ruvuma.Kawemba said: Amoah had to adjust to new life in Tanzania. He will be back anytime from now and we expect to use him in the next league matches. Our plan is to see him playing in the encounter against Tanzania Prisons and others. He is good defender who impressed our technical bench, hence their decision to recruit him. He will strengthen our defense line, which is very strong too, but in this league, there are ups and downs, you need to have a big squad to play all matches successfully, said Kawemba.Concerning Wawa, Kawemba said the Ivorian defender has started training, and he s now fit for the league matches. Wawa has been injured for a long time now, and did not feature in many crucial matches. Our player is now okay. He s managed to play friendly matches, and will be back in the team soon, sai Kawemba.He said the club now had a wider pool from which to pick top players, and would not be worried much even after some of them were on national assignments. We are proud with our players, we have a good number of them, even when some are with Taifa Stars and other national team players, he said.
