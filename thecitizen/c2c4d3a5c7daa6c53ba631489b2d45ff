Kibaha. Coast Region has 505,788 cattle, far above its capacity to accommodate 249,002 cattle, leading to recurring land conflicts between herders and farmers, it has been revealed.Currently, the region has only 498,001 hectares of pasture land, which is enough for 249,002 cattle, according to the regional commissioner, Mr Evarist Ndikilo.Speaking, when opening a regional consultative council (RCC) meeting, Mr Ndikilo said: Conflicts between pastoralists and farmers continue to be a threat to peace in our region. He asked the RCC members to come up with recommendations on how the growing problem could be addressed. He asked the district administration to set strategies, which would enable them to contain intermittent clashes.Presenting a paper on clashes between farmers and pastoralists, assistant regional administrative secretary dealing with the economy and production Shangwe Twamala said clashes between the two groups started in 2006, when the government removed pastoralists from Ihefu in Mbeya Region and directed that they be shifted to Coast Region, Lindi and Mtwara.He said because the area, which the pastoralists were supposed to shift to in Lindi and Mtwara were not yet prepared, most of the cattle were directed towards Rufiji River Valley and Bagamoyo, Kisarawe, Kibaha and Mkuranga in Coast Region.Twamala told the meeting that due to the influx of cattle in the region the number had increased from 148,099 in 2005/06 to 505,788 in 2014/15, when a livestock census was conducted.He said given the situation, district councils in the region set aside 498,000 hectares for 250,000 cattle out of 505,788 were identified.In his remarks, Mafia Member of Parliament Mbaraka Dau (CCM) said many herds of cattle had continued enter the region through illegal routes, which exerted pressure on land and water resources.Mr Dau urged leaders in every place to have mechanisms, which would allow them to detect signs of clashes in advance and deal with them.
