Chunya. The District Magistrate Court has sentenced Godfrey Philimon, 31, to life imprisonment after being found him guilty of defiling his six-year-old stepson.District Magistrate Osmund Ngatunga delivered the ruling on Friday after the final submission from the defence.The prosecutor, Mr Ramund Rukomwa, had requested the court to give stern punishment to the convict to serve as a deterrent. Mr Rukomwa told the court that the convict committed the offence on May 20 this year and threatened to kill the stepson if he dared to tell anyone about what had transpired, including the boy s mother.In his mitigation, Philimon asked for a lenient punishment, claiming it was his first offence. The magistrate ignored his plea and sent him jail for life.
