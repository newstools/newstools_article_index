Zanzibar. Women s rights activists want the government to review the Education Act saying it is not punitive enough to stop men from impregnating school girls.Speaking during a symposium on early marriages held in Nungwi District, North Unguja, activists said the Sh1,500 fine against men who impregnate school girls does not reflect the gravity of the offence.According to section 34 of the Education Act number 6 of 1984, a man who impregnates a school girl once convicted, will be fined between Sh1,500 and Sh3,000 if he is a first offender. If it is the man s second conviction, he will be fined between Sh3,000 and Sh5,500 and if he commits the same offence for a third time the fine has been pegged at between Sh5,500 and Sh10,000 or six-month imprisonment.Bin Sumeit University lecturer Jema Suleiman Khalfan, said the law was the first impediment in efforts to address early pregnancies. The amount fined is ridiculous to say the least. No one will be deterred from committing this offence as one knows that he will be capable of paying the fine and walking away, she said.She noted that if the government was serious in its commitment to address early pregnancies, it should amend the law on impregnating school girls.
