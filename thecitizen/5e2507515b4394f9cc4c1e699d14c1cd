Dar es Salaam. It was something that they touched on during the Multichoice content showcase last year and now it seems they are ready to deliver on it.Speaking to The Beat from Johannesburg Zee World s head of marketing Linda Oliphant said they were looking forward to launch the Kiswahili channel in East Africa very soon.This according to her will open up a world of entertainment to East Africa like never before with the availability of Bollywood in Kiswahili. Just like in every market where we go our first and most important step is research and content selection. Without these two things there is no channel. Next we partner with companies who help us customise our content for the market we are entering into, she saidShe added: Parallel to the above process we engage with distributors who will carry the channel. Once we have all the above in place and all contracts are signed and sealed, we will then proceed to launch the channel.
