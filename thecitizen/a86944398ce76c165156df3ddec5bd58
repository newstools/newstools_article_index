Musoma. Government institutions in the district owe Musoma Urban Water and Sewerage Authority (Muwasa) at least Sh794 million in unpaid bills.Muwasa managing director Said Gantala has named some of the defaulters as Mara Regional Hospital, Prisons Department, Police, Mara Regional Administrative Secretary s office, District Executive Director s office and businesspersons.Mr Gantala revealed this last week when Musoma District Commissioner Vincent Naano visited Bukanga Village where a water project is being implemented by Muwasa.Dr Naano issued a one-month ultimatum to the public institutions to pay up outstanding bills. There are indications that Muwasa is failing to effectively supply water to the Musoma residents due to the unpaid water bills by public institutions, he said.Dr Naano directed the district water authority to send letters to the institutions asking them to state when they would begin paying their outstanding bills and through what mode of payment. They should be frank and if they cannot afford to foot their water bills, they must tell you (Muwasa) so that you disconnect them, he said.Mr Gantala added that the unpaid bills hinder effective delivery of water services.
