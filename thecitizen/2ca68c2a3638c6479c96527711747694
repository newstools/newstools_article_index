Dar es Salaam. African Lyon rediscovered the winning formula in the ongoing Tanzania Mainland Vodacom Premier league yesterday to outclass visiting Ndanda Football Club 1-0 at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam.Lyon started the match with a bang and dominated for most of the first half but was largely let down by misfiring strikers who missed many clear chances.This forced African Lyon head coach Bernado Tavares to make changes in the second half.

I am happy to win the match despite the fact that the match was very tough, and we missed many chances. Ndanda FC is strong team, with many experienced players, he said.
