Zanzibar. Electricity consumers in Zanzibar will now find it increasingly easy to pay their power bills, thanks to the re-launch of a service that allows them to do so directly via their mobile phones. The service known as Tukuza is a brainchild of Zantel and the Zanzibar Electricity Corporation (Zeco). It was launched some years ago but had been inaccessible for the past few months.Tukuza allows Zeco clients to make payments via their mobile phones on Zantel s Ezypesa platform.The service now has a new robust system which allows it to handle an increased number of people at one time, according to the Zantel chief executive officer, Benoit Janin. We made a commitment to the people of Zanzibar to revamp the Tukuza service. We are confident that with the investment that has gone into the upgrade, the service will have no more problems or shortcomings, he said here yesterday.With the service, electricity consumers will now not be required to flock to Zeco offices to pay their power bills for they can do so conveniently and instantly.Speaking at the event, the Zeco managing director, Mr Hassan Ali Mbarouk, said their partnership with Ezypesa is an important milestone that enables people in the Isles to get a hassle free service in addition to increased income for the Ezypesa agents. Now our customers will be able to purchase electricity and reconnect their supply instantly. This is by using their EzyPesa accounts on their mobile phones, from anywhere and anytime, thereby saving time spent in queues said Mr Mbarouk.
