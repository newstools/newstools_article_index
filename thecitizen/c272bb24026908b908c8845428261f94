Let me divert from the common topics that I write about: finance, investments, economics, capital markets, stock exchanges, good corporate governance, etc into a topic that I am not so conversant about, but of which I have recently taken a great interest on it and I am trying to learn History and Philosophy.In the process of living, it is fairly expected that, we, humans in our own ways we should always try to pursue ideas that will unleash our potentials in the process of creating a good society a society where citizens are largely satisfied, where the society is defined to be good, where people are happy as they thrive in their undertaking. The society that values decency, responsibility, justice, tolerance and where natural human rights are observed. The society that debates, builds consensus, and make good choices in the pursuance of a good and happy life. Does this sound like a utopian ideal of a society? Yes and No.That s why in the history of human kind and humanity; great thinkers, political and moral philosophers, etc in different eras dating as back as history can record; philosophers such as Confucius, the Chinese philosopher, and his disciples such as Mencius; great greek philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, and disciples like Alexander the Great; Thinkers and philosophers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Charles Darwin, and Thomas Hobbes; all have tried to conceive the idea of an ideal society the society that is generally happy in the ways and conducts; in such a society, the role of individuals, the role of institutions within a society and role of the state is somehow defined.We also have US political and economic thinkers George Washington (who founded their nation), Thomas Jefferson (who gave it the Constitution), Abraham Lincoln (who preserved their union during challenging times in mid-1800s), Alexander Hamilton (the father of the US financial and banking system) to mention but just a few. As well as Eastern philosophers such as Karl Max and Friedrich Engels, to contemporary thinkers and leaders in the ideas and ideals of a good society such as Jean Rousseau, Vladimir Lenin, John Keynes, Friedrich Hanes, Martin Lurther King, Arthur Okun and many others all these came up with differing ideas as they struggled in different eras of human history, in different way and circumstances, in different places using their intellectual, political and moral capacities trying to pour their thinking in envisioning what attributes will make a good society.Reading from their philosophical thinking and learning from them one may notice many different concepts about the topic; however the following four concepts would come out clearly and easily: (i) Liberty/freedom (both political and economy freedom to members of society in their pursuance of a fair, just and happy life); (ii) Equality (political and economic equality to members of the society as well as equality of opportunity to utilise available resources in the betterment of their lives); (iii) Efficiency (this can be achieved on the basis on the idea that a society can organise and order their political, social, humanistic and economic activities as well as creating or maximising wealth, using institutions and entities set up as key vehicles to propel society s betterment encouraging efficiency use of natural and human resources for greater good and economic efficiency for wealth enhancement); and finally (iv) Community (encouraging the use of intellectual and political process/activity to create a fair and just society that looks in the shared and communion interests).What does all this mean? As it is supposed to be, national states and/or societies should define themselves according to what deeply matters to them, what are their fundamental values and principles what is broadly the society s character, how is the society defined or rather how would it like to be defined by the outside world. For some nations for example, upon the mentioning liberty and efficiency as core values to a nation, it wouldn t be difficult to relate these values to the US; for the U.S since their time of enlightenment and independence in 1770s these has been largely their fundamental values and interests. For the Chinese, especially during Mao s time it was squarely about equality (especially equality of economic and social opportune) but recently the ideas of efficiency and community has come into the fore in the Chinese society and in their means of governance as they try to create what would be a good society for them. For the Japanese, soon after the World War Two (WW2), their society have defined itself as a society that deeply cares about efficiency. For Europe, many nations have been trying to find a good compromise between freedom and equality and for western Europe, with some form of efficiency as well. And so, different countries have been either using democratic processes or other governance and decision making platforms as means towards achieving these four fundamental concepts for society endurance and betterment.What about us how are we defined, how can we be defined? what are our societal values? what do we hold deeply as our fundamental principles? how does the outside would define us as a society? how do we use our governance systems and tools to debate, to build censuses, to make choices to enable us as individuals and in our collective way to pursue our happiness, to unleash our goodness, to unlock our potentials in a shared destiny?. Does we, as individuals, corporations, political institutions, civil society movements, government institutions, etc within our society in pursuance of our ambitions, clearly understand what is it that we value most in the process of creating a good society?.Let us assume that we were a society that values equality and a great sense of community values as our fundamental principles if this was the case, have we then been pursuing policies and activities that aims on closing the gap between the rich and poor or between haves and have-nots within our society? as an example, are we using a progressive tax system or a tax code that taxes the rich more than it does for the poor? do we give appropriate access to an affordable and standardised education and health care to all our people? do we promote efforts that encourages collective goodness? do we ensure that the quality of life for our people meets the basic human standards? do we give equal opportunity for all in our society to participate in our governance decision making and in participating in economic activities? or do we discriminate some members of our society (by gender, religion, ethnicity, etc) from pursuing opportunities which should be equal to all?For corporate entities operating within our system; the system that were to value equality and community do they know that meritocracy system isn t the way our people are hired and rewarded? that egalitarian and humanisms are our values when it comes to corporates relations with their employees, that we require employees protection against various forms of risks through entitlements, that employees have job guarantees and security and that they are paid as equally as possible, that organisation policies and practices are structured in pursuit of enhancement of all employees personal growth; that employees participates in decision making and in career-learning.Remember, I started these last two paragraphs by saying, let us assume I therefore do not intend to portray that what I have just prescribe above, as to mean that s how our society is defined. But then, how is it defined? when we collective pursue our different political, economic and social activities that fundamentally makes us happy and satisfied as human beings and citizens of a country endowed with resources to be used in making peoples lives better and just.And so in our societal struggles, in our imaginations, in our challenges and crisis, in our adaptions and adoptions, in our pursuance of humanistic, social, political and economic orientation; let us and especially our leadership re-define and re-educate us as to what are our deeply held values as a society, so we can collectively aim towards living these values.Mr Marwa is chief executive officer of the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange Email: moremi@dse.co.tz
