Dar es Salaam. East African Community Heads of State have pushed back the date for the final decision on the bloc s commitment on the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with European Union to January next year.After almost six hours of closed door meetings at the Magogoni State House, the EAC chairman, President John Magufuli, told the plenary session We will not fail to agree and I believe the solution we reach will be a win-win, said Dr Magufuli at the meeting attended by presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Dr Mohammed Ali Shein of Zanzibar. Kenya s Deputy President William Ruto represented President Uhuru Kenyatta.President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi was represented by his Foreign Affairs minister Alain Nyamitwe while South Sudan was represented by Aggrey Sabuni President Salva Kiir s special envoy.The leaders emerged from the meeting showing a united front on a matter that exposed the bloc s fissures as members sought to go separate ways in concluding the trade deal with EU that took 14 years to negotiate. Kenya and Rwanda signed the agreement a week ago but the others have dithered over concerns on the effects of the agreement on their local economies.But even as the EAC leaders expressed the desire to take a common stand on the deal, their speeches, however, revealed there were difficult times ahead before a delivery on their promise, with Dr Shein hinting to a possibility of there being members who are ready to proceed with the signing and others joining in later. The EAC Protocol provides for such a window.The problem with that approach, however, is that the EU would not consider the deal as signed if it is not appended to by all the EAC member states, except Burundi and South Sudan who are currently exempted. The EU has slapped sanctions against Burundi while South Sudan only received its official membership certificate this week.
