Mororogo. The government held a public auction of teak trees at its farm located in Mvomero District, fetching more than Sh1.4billion.Three out of 18 companies participated in the auction at Tanzania Forest Services Agency (TFS) in Mtibwa division, Turiani. The trees had been planted more than 40 years ago.Only local companies that included Mohamed Enterprises Tanzania Limited (METL), Sazo Company and Prime Timbers bought trees.According to the director of Planning and Sustainable Use of Forests, Mr Mohamed Kilongo, the auction had taken into account the instructions of the government that all forest products should be sold at auctions and not through the issuance of permits as it was in the past.Mr Kilongo urged the companies to harvest the trees in two months time, to create room for new ones to be planted.
