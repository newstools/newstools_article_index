Dar es Salaam. Fastjet has launched a connecting flight service through its Dar es Salaam s Julius Nyerere International Airport hub that will see the company offering its customers with linking flight options.Under the service, which was announced yesterday, Fastjet passengers select where they are flying to and from on www.fastjet.com, and the airline s reservations system will then search for the best connecting flights to their chosen destination.The passenger chooses his ar her preferred connecting Fastjet flight and completes theibooking process thereby helping passengers from the trouble of making two or more separate bookings. The connecting flights are booked together under a single ticket and single booking reference and passengers will only need to pay for checked-in baggage once for both legs of their journey .. previously passengers had to make two separate bookings, incurring luggage charges and taxes for each booking, and then had to check in and collect their luggage twice, said the Fastjet Tanzania general manager, Mr John Corse.
