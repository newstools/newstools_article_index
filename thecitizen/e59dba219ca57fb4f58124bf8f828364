Moshi. Tanzanian consumers have been urged to buy locally manufactured goods in order to stimulate the domestic economy. Founder of the Nongovernmental organisation known as, Fursa Group Tanzania, Mr Godfrey Malisa made the plea while speaking at an entrepreneurship workshop held in Moshi District, Kilimanjaro, recently. Tanzania is now headed towards industrialisation and the only way we can make this move a success is to foster the habit of purchasing locally manufactured products, he said.Mr Malisa, who is also the Chairperson of the group, said the institution has started raising awareness by organising seminars in the Northern Zone regions. These conferences are vital because they would enable Tanzanians to identify several economic opportunities from a number of natural resources found in the country, he said.
