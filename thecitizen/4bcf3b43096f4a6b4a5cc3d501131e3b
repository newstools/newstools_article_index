Dar es Salaam. The fate of hundreds of students and pupils in the Eckernforde schools and colleges is hanging in the balance after the Registration Insolvency and Trusteeship Agency (Rita) deregistered the Eckernforde Education Institute for violation of the law.The Eckernforde Education Institute is a Tanga-based trustee that owns the Eckernforde Tanga University, the Eckernforde English Medium Primary and Secondary School, the Eckernforde Secondary School, the Eckernforde Teachers Training College, among others.A public notice released yesterday said that Eckernforde and 180 other institutions have been revoked and removed from the official register of the Administrator General of Trustees after failure to respond to the 30-day notice issued on August 5 this year. Henceforth, all such immovable property enforceable by or against the (deregistered institutions) before the revocation of its incorporation shall be enforceable and under supervision of the Public Trustee (Rita) for the time being, the notice issued yesterday and signed by Rita administrator general Emmy K Hudson said.Educational institutionsIt was not clear yesterday what would be the fate of the educational institutions supervised by the Eckernforde Education Institute, which are registered by the relevant educational authorities.The Citizen efforts to get a comment on the matter from the Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU), which registers universities, proved futile.TCU Assistant Director of Admission and Documentation, Dr Kokuberwa Mollel, declined to comment, throwing the ball to the commission s legal department which could not be reached up to the time this report was filed.The Permanent Secretary in the ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Vocational Training, Ms Maimuna Tarishi, for her part, said she was unaware of the Rita decisions, meaning she could not comment on them. In general, I have nothing to say. Seek comments of the National Examination Council of Tanzania (Necta) or the Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU), she said.When reached for comment, Eckernforde Education Institute assistant director, Mr David Njau, declined to shed light on the issue. We don t give information through mobile phone interviews. You better come to the office tomorrow (today). We are currently busy attending the funeral of our colleague s son, he said.The 181 institutions deregistered were among 5,000 that were found to have violated some sections of the Trustee Incorporation Act of 2002 .
