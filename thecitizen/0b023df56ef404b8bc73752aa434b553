Ljubljana. New UEFA boss Aleksander Ceferin has been a high profile lawyer in his native Slovenia but had no record in football until he took over his country s football federation in 2011.The 48-year-old father of three has often appeared on Slovenian television speaking for high-profile defendants represented by his family law firm, never losing his temper and always keeping the image of someone who has the situation under control.UEFA will be a severe test of his skills as it seeks to overcome the shock of losing ex-leader Michel Platini, implicated in FIFA s corruption scandals, and facing challenges to its prized Champions League.Ceferin already surprised people when he took over the presidency of Slovenia s football association, the NZS, in 2011 and quickly joined FIFA s disciplinary committee and UEFA s legal committee.Besides reorganizing the NZS, Ceferin is also credited with bringing together the former Yugoslavian republics in 2015 to make them a football politics bloc. I was the first to bring to the same table the national associations of the former state (Yugoslavia), that we adopted a common positions and presented them to UEFA and by doing so improved our reputation within UEFA, he told state television in a recent interview.Ceferin really emerged as a growing power in international sports in June when he announced his bid to become UEFA president with the backing of over a dozen European associations ranging from Russia to Scandinavian countries.He says running for UEFA s top job was not his idea.
