In retrospect, I was looking for ways to reengage my artistry [over the past couple of years], and there have certainly been things I passed on to do the things I felt gave me the right amount of challenge, she told Entertainment Weekly. She adds: It was the first time I felt really awakened by a script and super challenged. Queen of Katwe is the colorful true story of a young girl selling corn on the streets of rural Uganda whose world rapidly changes when she is introduced to the game of chess, and, as a result of the support she receives from her family and community, is instilled with the confidence and determination she needs to pursue her dream of becoming an international chess champion.For 10-year-old Phiona Mutesi (Nalwanga) and her family, life in the impoverished slum of Katwe in Kampala, Uganda, is a constant struggle.Her mother, Harriet (Nyong o), is fiercely determined to take care of her family and works tirelessly selling vegetables in the market to make sure her children are fed and have a roof over their heads.When Phiona meets Robert Katende (Oyelowo), a soccer player turned missionary who teaches local children chess, she is captivated.
