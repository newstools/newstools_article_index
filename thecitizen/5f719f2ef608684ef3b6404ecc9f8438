Dar es Salaam. President John Magufuli confirms Former National Social Security Fund (NSSF) director general Ramadhan Dau as Tanzania new ambassador to Malaysia.Mr Dau was sworn in earlier today at State House by President John Pombe Magufuli ending his nine months of waiting for a foreign post since he was appointed as ambassador designate in January this year.He is going to Kuala Lumpur to fill a vacant left by Dr Aziz Mlima who is currently serving as the Permanent Secretary (PS) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Community.His ascendance to the office comes a week after Foreign Affairs Minister Dr Augustine Mahiga confirmed to The Citizen that Dr Dau was indeed designated for Kuala Lumpur. He was responding to a query by The Citizen that wanted to establish the truth about reports on an online publication Africa Intelligence revealing the appointment.Dr Dau was removed from NSSF after 15 years stint as a director general early in the year by President John Magufuli who then named him ambassador designate. His removal came in at a time when NSSF has been marred by embezzlement allegations.Several NSSF directors and other senior managers were recently suspended from office to pave the way for investigations into alleged imprompriety in the handling of mega-housing projects worth billions of shillings.Meanwhile President Magufuli also sworn in three new Regional Secretaries (RASs) who were appointed last week. They are Mr Eliya Ntandu who is becoming the first RAS of newly formed Songwe Region. Others are Mr Adoh Mapunda and Tixon Tuliangine who are posted to Mara and Rukwa regions respectively.
