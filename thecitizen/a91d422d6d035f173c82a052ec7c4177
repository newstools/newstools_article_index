Dar es Salaam. Opposition party Civic United Front (CUF) on Saturday rejected a stand by the Registrar of Political Parties, Judge Francis Mutungi for endorsing Prof Ibrahim Lipumba as bona fide national chairman of the party.In a statement issued shortly after Judge Mutungi issued the directive, CUF deputy secretary general Nassor Ahmed Mazrui said according to the Political Parties Act, No. 5 of 1992, the Registrar has no legal authority to give advice or directives on issues that a political party decides through its legal organs. We would like to ask the Registrar of Political Parties to reserve his advice as we don t need it, said Mr Mazrui.Mr Mazrui made the remarks shortly after Judge Mutungi noted in a statement that his office recognises Prof Lipumba as the bona fide CUF national chairman.The Registrar also reinstated all CUF members who were either suspended or sacked by the party following its aborted national congress in Dar es Salaam.He said the decision by CUF national council to suspend its members on its August 21 meeting was null and void as the decision did not follow party constitution procedures which, among other things, required a member to be given a chance to defend him or herself before being penalised.Judge Mutungi also declared that the special committee picked by the party s national council to lead the party in the interim, was unconstitutional.While CUF used the Political Parties Act to reject the Registrar verdict, Judge Mutungi also used the same law to authenticate his decision.Judge Mutungi said the interim committee was unconstitutional as there was no vacant leadership position that was supposed to be filled at the time of their appointment.In a related development, soon after the Registrar statement, a group of CUF members arrived at the party headquarters in Buguruni waiting for Prof Lipumba to retake his leadership position.However, they were unable to enter the offices as the gates were locked. Later, after Prof Lipumba arrived, they forced their way into the compound.Talking to reporters, Prof Lipumba hailed the decision by the Registrar noting that it conformed with CUF s constitution.In a statement issued later, Mr Mazrui asked CUF members across the country to remain calm and note that the Registrar has no power to override decisions the party had in connection its former chairman, Prof Lipumba.
