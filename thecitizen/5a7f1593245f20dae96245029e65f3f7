We have tried our level best to collect the money in vain some of the entities have opted to seek services from other local telecommunication services providers, he said. A member of the committee, former Home Affairs minister Charles Kitwanga said: The government must force institutions that owe TTCL to immediately pay up their debts. However, Mr Kitwanga expressed concern that TTCL has only 800,000 active customers in a country with a population of about 49 million people.
