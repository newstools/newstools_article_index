Despite the progressive decline in the number of women who deliver before arrival to health centers in 2014 countrywide, the situation remains critical in Manyara and Tabora regions.Data from the ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, the Elderly and Children, show that in 2014, a total of 37,076 women delivered on their way to health centers. Manyara, Tabora and Dar es Salaam recorded an increase of more than half in the trend.Only one out of ten women(93 per cent) deliver while in hospital, a figure that experts say is abysmally low and is likely to compromise attainment of Millennium Goal 5 by the year 2020 as projected.Dar es Salaam, the most urbanized urban Centre in Tanzania that hosts more than 4.8milion people, lags behind Tabora with 56 and 74 per cent respectively.
