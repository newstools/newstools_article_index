Upgrading of the 22 kilometre road linking Mererani gemstone mines to the rest of the country through Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA) will be complete by the end of this year, it was revealed here recently.The project costs Sh.32 billion and is being undertaken by a Chinese construction firm, China Henan International Corporation Group Limited (Chico). Manyara regional manager for Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads) Yohane Kisaini said the upgrading being financed fully by the government. All the civil works will be completed by December, Mr Kisaini said when he briefed residents of the area about the progress of the project which was inaugurated in May last year. Delays were caused by Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited in the removal of electricity poles and cables especially near the mining town, he explained.Upgrading of the busy road was one of the promises made by the government way back in 1995 when former president Benjamin Mkapa came to power.The road is expected to boost the economy of the area, especially tanzanite mining at Mererani which has led to the flourishing of other economic activities in the semi-arid area and ease transportation between Mererani and Arusha and Moshi.
