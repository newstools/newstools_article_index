Dar es Salaam. Police in Dar es Salaam fire warning shots and use tear gases to disperse the supporters of former Civic United Front (CUF) chairman professor Ibrahim Lipumba who wanted to break into the party s headquarters to prevent party s interim chairman Julius Mtatiro from holding a press conference.The supporters claimed to have a letter from Registrar of Political Party s office barring leaders from holding any official activity until a leadership dispute is resolved.Prof Lipumba, who has been suspended by the party for causing a fracas during the party s congress last month, wrote to the registrar Judge (retired) Francis Mutungi to notify him that he is still the party s chairman.Mr Mtatiro had called a press conference to respond to President John Magufuli s speeches made in his rallies in Pemba and Unguja. He condemned the speeches.
