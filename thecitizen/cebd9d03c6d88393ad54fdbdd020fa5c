Dar es Salaam. Deloitte East Africa is seeking practical solutions to youth unemployment through training unemployed graduates who are hunting for jobs without innovative ideas to become jobs generators for themselves and others.The Deloitte senior manager for strategy and innovations Ms Zahra Nensi, told The Citizen on Tuesday that they have begun to select 65 graduate youths who are being trained to design innovative business ideas and train other youths to establish business projects for adding value to agricultural commodities.On last Friday The Citizen participated in the innovations capacity building seminar for those youths under the specialist trainers recruited by Deloitte.Speaking at the innovations centre based at the Commission of Science and Technology, Ms Nensi said that Tanzania was one of the member states of East African countries that benefit from such programme.According to her, Deloitte is partnering the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) which was launched by President of the United States Barack Obama in 2012 as a signature effort to invest in the next generation of African leaders. Deloitte aspires to transform Tanzanian graduate youths to become generators of employment through innovations. In Tanzania there are at least 800,000 graduates hunting for jobs annually. These are potential generators of jobs. We are working with Yali to get answers to graduate unemployment, she said.The consultant for Deloitte Mr Charles Mbatia said at the training seminar that since the country was aspiring to build an industrial economy, such practical solution being propagated by Deloitte was important move for stirring young graduates to embark on small industriers that later on can be vehicles for industrialisation. We are training youths to refrain from being mere job seekers, instead to venture in innovative business projects for job creation. Throughout the world the problem of graduate unemployment is growing and there is no government which can employ many youths to reduce high rate of unemployment, said Mbatia.The size of Tanzania's youth, which almost doubled from 4.4 million in 1990 to 8.1 million in 2010, is expected to swell to 11 million by 2020 and 15 million by 2030, according to report released in 2o13 by Jacques Morisset, the World Bank Lead economist.
