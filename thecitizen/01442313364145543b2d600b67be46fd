Adjumani. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Filippo Grandi, has urged the international community to fulfil their financial pledges towards helping refugees in Africa.While visiting Nyamanzi and Pagrinya refugee centres in Adjumani District on Monday, Mr Grandi said the international community have fulfilled about 70 per cent of their pledges in Western countries affected by refugees but that in Africa, they have fulfilled less than 30 per cent. The international community, please respond to the South Sudan [refugee] crisis in Uganda and elsewhere [in Africa] the same way you respond to crises in Europe. There [Europe], you have funded 60 to 70 per cent and here (Africa), 20-30 per cent. That is not right, he said. The UN official said resources are still insufficient to cater for the large number of refugees from South Sudan. According to UNHCR statistics, since the start of the year, the number of South Sudan refugees who have entered Uganda are 97,444. Mr Fillipo also called for an end to fighting in South Sudan. I hope peace has to come to South Sudan the leaders of that young country have to behave responsibly and not continue to ignore the plight of their people, he said.The UN official commended the Uganda government for hastily settling the refugees who came less than two months ago, saying it is only Uganda which has managed to provide land to refugees in the shortest time. The minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Mr Hilary Onek, said without the finances, it will be difficult for government to cater for the refugees.(NMG)
