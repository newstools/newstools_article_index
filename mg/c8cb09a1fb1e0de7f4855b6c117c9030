The 2016 local government elections have changed the political game in South Africa.&nbsp;Opposition victories had been predicted well in advance. But, now that they are actually a reality, the question on everyone&#8217;s lips is: What happens next?&nbsp;The majority of South Africans have a deeply personal, emotional connection to the 104-year-old ANC movement; for them, it was always more than a mere political party.Election after election, the ANC has hung on to its past glory and retained&nbsp;its support base. It has relied on emotional appeals to its liberation history and traditional loyalties. This time round, though, it was&nbsp;not enough -&nbsp;the party must now take stock and regroup after losing control of&nbsp;key&nbsp;metros like Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay.&nbsp;The electorate has spoken. Now,&nbsp;what does the ANC do after such losses?&nbsp;The Mail &amp; Guardian in collaboration with Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung invites you to join our post elections review&nbsp;discussion with&nbsp;by Ralph Mathekga, Faculty Head: Political Economy, Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection,&nbsp; Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection (Mistra) who will be moderating a panel comprising of:We ll listen to their points, and then take questions from the audience.
