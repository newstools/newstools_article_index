Lena Dunham s foot-in-mouth disease has made headlines once again after she decided to disparage American football star Odell Beckham Junior for not paying attention to her at the Met Gala.via GIPHYDuring&nbsp;a conversation with comedian Amy Schumer, Dunham revealed she was seated near Beckham who ignored because -&nbsp;&nbsp;she assumed - he did not find her sexually appealing.&#8220;[He] looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards,&#8221; Dunham said. &#8220;He was like, &#8216;That&#8217;s a marshmallow. That&#8217;s a child. That&#8217;s a dog.&#8217; It wasn&#8217;t mean &mdash; he just seemed confused.&#8221;Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham are God awful human beings. https://t.co/ztDvEU3dxL pic.twitter.com/Gm8u2Yg6ca&mdash; TOM S R OS (@TheTomasRios) September 2, 2016 Ah, yes, this is why someone Lena Dunham has never (?) met before might not want to talk to her: pic.twitter.com/QCc1hoKFfP&mdash; Puja Patel (@senari) September 2, 2016Dunham has since apologised via her Instagram account, saying she projected her personal insecurities onto OBJ and &#8220;presented them as facts&#8221; and that she sees &#8220;how unfair it is to ascribe misogynistic thoughts to someone I don&#8217;t know AT ALL&#8221;. However, this is not the only social media post by Dunham that has begun to recirculate this week.Dunham also received backlash on Twitter for other dubious posts which read:. @lenadunham you CANNOT be so lost in #whiteprivilege that you think this is funny. #racist #problematic #youknowbetter&mdash; Bflood28 (@Bflood28) September 2, 2016When #lenadunham is capable of being such a positive role model why on earth has she descended into stuff like this? pic.twitter.com/GTeCM5DUNT&mdash; Lisa Wilkinson (@Lisa_Wilkinson) September 3, 2016think you meant ignorant/racist RT @lenadunham I had a real goth/fundamentalist attitude when I woke up from my nap http://t.co/o3CceZV1&mdash; Ayesha A.

I owe Odell Beckham Jr an apology. Despite my moments of bravado, I struggle at industry events (and in life) with the sense that I don&#8217;t rep a certain standard of beauty and so when I show up to the Met Ball surrounded by models and swan-like actresses it&#8217;s hard not to feel like a sack of flaming garbage. This felt especially intense with a handsome athlete as my dinner companion and a bunch of women I was sure he&#8217;d rather be seated with. But I went ahead and projected these insecurities and made totally narcissistic assumptions about what he was thinking, then presented those assumptions as facts. I feel terrible about it. Because after listening to lots of valid criticism, I see how unfair it is to ascribe misogynistic thoughts to someone I don&#8217;t know AT ALL. Like, we have never met, I have no idea the kind of day he&#8217;s having or what his truth is. But most importantly, I would never intentionally contribute to a long and often violent history of the over-sexualization of black male bodies- as well as false accusations by white women towards black men. I&#8217;m so sorry, particularly to OBJ, who has every right to be on his cell phone. The fact is I don&#8217;t know about his state of mind (I don&#8217;t know a lot of things) and I shouldn&#8217;t have acted like I did.

Well, #NotAllMen thrives on the same defence so please step aside.&nbsp;The term &#8220;white feminism&#8221; is not now nor will it ever be an accusation. It is merely a description of an interconnected system that privileges a particular group, just like the word &#8220;patriarchy&#8221;. It is a term that references a specific set of behaviours and practices. It speaks to a system of oppression, not one individual in particular. Don t cry, don t beg.There are many feminists who happen to be white, who fully embrace intersectionality due to, amongst other things, this influential blog post written in 2011 by Flavia Dzodan entitled, &#8220; My Feminism Will Be Intersectional Or It Will Be Bullshit&#8221;.The term white feminism was coined sometime around that time, by people attempting to distinguish mainstream feminism from intersectional feminism. It is used to critique some feminists&#8217; tendency to sidestep and dismiss issues and topics that don&#8217;t affect them as white women namely but not limited to race and class.Dunham is one of many rich, able-bodied, white heterosexual women who claim feminism but engage in and further their problematic behaviour under the banner of feminism. She&#8217;s one of many&nbsp;white women who have also been in the throes of problematic privilege who say awful things and apologise profusely after being called out for it.&nbsp; Mandy Stadtmiller defending The&nbsp;Onion for calling then 9-year-old Quvenzhan Wallis, a c*nt on Twitter.&nbsp;I&#8217;m *an* editor not the editor of xoJane.

I don&#8217;t have time to get into her pal Miley Cyrus. It&#8217;s too early for an aneurysm.&nbsp;If you want to learn about intersectional feminism please visit&nbsp;Google.com or alternatively listen when women of colour tell you about their lived experiences.&nbsp;It&#8217;s not enough to keep repeating the cycles of saying myopic or short-sighted and hurtful things about black people or other marginalised groups. Ignorance is an easy cop-out, the burden of unlearning problematic beliefs is a personal journey of introspection and admitting mistakes. Just because something doesn&#8217;t bother you directly doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t exist.
