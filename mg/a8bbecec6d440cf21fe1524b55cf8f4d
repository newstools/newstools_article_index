ANCYL members have disrupted a press briefing organised by members of the new occupy Luthuli House movement. The group intends to lead a mass demonstration&nbsp;to the ANC&#8217;s headquarters to hand over their list of demands. Youth leaders in Tshwane, however, took exception to the press briefing and ensured that it was stopped, at least temporarily. They argued that the movement had no right to brandish ANC colours and effectively operate as though they were leaders in the ruling party. Those who stormed the briefing were&nbsp;regional Secretary Ratshi Masahamba, deputy chairperson Ezra Letsoalo and councillor and youth league regional chairperson Lesego Makhubela. The&nbsp;#OccupyLuthuliHouse movement intends to march to Luthuli House on September 5 to demand the following: Immediate resignation of the President Immediate resignation of the whole ANC NEC Forming of a task team comprising stalwarts to take the ANC to a consultative conference for renewal Immediate implementation of free and quality education and disbandment of the Fees Commission#OccupyLuthuliHouse youth leave leaders in the region disrupt the briefing say it&#8217;s over @News24 pic.twitter.com/rv8Ck1dsDB&mdash; Matshidiso Madia (@tshidi_lee) September 2, 2016
