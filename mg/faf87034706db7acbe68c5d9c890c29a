The EFF on Monday expressed support for the pupils protesting against alleged racism at Pretoria Girls High School.&#8220;It is deeply saddening that 22 years into democracy, there are still institutions of any kind that seek to directly suppress blackness in its aesthetics and culture,&#8221; EFF acting national spokesperson Fana Mokoena said in a statement.&#8220;This is a direct result of a society still struggling with transformation and failing to address white hegemony,&#8221; he said.Some girls alleged they had been subjected to racism and were being discouraged from keeping their hair natural. They staged a protest at the school on Sunday.Pupils claimed hairstyles such as braids, afros and dreadlocks were against the school&#8217;s rules.According to the school s code of conduct: &#8220;Cornrows, natural dreadlocks and singles/braids (with or without extensions) are allowed, provided they are a maximum of 10mm in diameter. Singles/braids must be the same length and the natural colour of the girl s hair.&#8221;Longer braids had to be tied back. No patterned cornrows were allowed.The Citizen reported that a petition was circulated, that had garnered 4 201 signatures by early Monday morning. In it, the school is accused of forcing black girls to straighten their natural hair and claiming they re &#8220;conspiring&#8221; when standing in groups.Inherently racistMokoena said a white minority culture was still dictating to a black majority what they should look like and how they should behave.&#8220;This culture is as old as slavery itself and does not belong in a democratic dispensation such as ours.&#8221;Mokoena said the ANC Women s League was silent on the struggle of the young black women at Pretoria Girls High School.&#8220;Racism cannot be eradicated if we are not brave enough to do and say the hard things and honestly bare it open for scrutiny. The ANC and its women s league has failed to lead our battles in general, and of women in particular,&#8221; he said.The EFF said policies against natural hair were inherently racist and had to be rejected.&#8220;People s natural looks or how they choose to adorn themselves are a right we must protect jealously,&#8221; the EFF said.He said the young protesters had given the country hope that the dreams of a fearless society led by brave women and men were alive.&#8220;We applaud the gallant forces of the young black women at Pretoria Girls High who have taken their struggle into their own hands and shown our government what leadership really is.&#8221;&nbsp;-&nbsp;News24
