The project is funded by the European Union and administered by the Jacana Literary Foundation, in partnership with the M&amp;G Literary Festival.Thabiso Afurakan Mohare (adjudication of poetry in English), Goodenough Mashego (adjudication of poetry in indigenous languages) and Pieter Odendaal (adjudication of poetry in Afrikaans) compiled the longlist.Professor Mongane Wally Serote, as chair of the panel, will select the top three poems.The work submitted is judged blind, and the longlist will be published in volume six of the anthology. A shortlist of three poets selected from the longlist will be announced on September 23. They will be invited to attend the M&amp;G Literary Festival, where the winner will be announced and cash prizes awarded for first, second and third place.The judges have sought poems that reveal the political and social attitudes of our time and reflect the complex, nuanced and uncomfortable truths of life in South Africa. All established, esteemed poets themselves, they each bring a unique perspective &mdash; Mohare and Odendaal the relevance and brilliance of the lively spoken word and slam poetry scene in Johannesburg and Cape Town respectively, Mashego the skill of a multlingual, multitalented wordsmith, and Serote an unrivalled literary sensibility.
