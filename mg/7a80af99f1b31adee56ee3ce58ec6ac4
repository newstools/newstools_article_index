Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa urged members of Parliament to help themselves to the new government condoms - designed for maximum pleasure and to make no noise - on Thursday. Answering questions in the National Assembly, the deputy president lauded the new condoms, which were introduced in June. They were aimed at increasing prevention of HIV&nbsp;in the country, Ramaphosa said, as MPs giggled at the description of the Max condoms. Users had complained that the old condoms did not smell nice, he said. Moreover, the Choice condoms made a noise during the act of sex, Ramaphosa told the amused MPs. Ramaphosa&#8217;s move was lauded by some on Twitter as an important step in highlighting the issue of HIV and Aids and government&#8217;s response to it. Some even found humour in it. Lol and #Ramaphosa was on serious vibes with the issue at hand &mdash; Mulalo Sean (@LalieSean) September 1, 2016 Such a great PR stunt for Max Condoms by #Ramaphosa in Parliament re: International Aids Conference resolutions &amp; govt&#8217;s plans &mdash; Sphelele (@SpheDludla) September 1, 2016 Some were not impressed and felt&nbsp; the&nbsp;government should turn their attention to other important matters. #Ramaphosa Instead of increasing brands of free condoms maybe you should spare some money for free sanitary pads.. &mdash; Judy (@PhumuJudy) September 1, 2016 The government was efficient in coming up with condoms but can&#8217;t really attend to real issues of #sanitary towels. #Ramaphosa #NA&mdash; Poverty&#8217;sNotRomantic (@MatlhomolaX) September 1, 2016 Ramaphosa said they had fixed and improved the formula, bringing in more flavours. &#8220;Now, through scientific development, we were able to develop a new condom which is called Max. Max is for maximum pleasure and protection. It does not make noise at all,&#8221; he said. Not only that, but they now come in different flavours, he said, waving the condoms around. &#8220;If you want a grape flavour, here it is. If you want an apple flavour, you can get an apple flavour.&#8221; When UDM MP Mncedisi Filtane asked who cared to listen to noise &#8220;at that moment&#8221;, the deputy president answered that they were merely responding to concerns from the users. &#8220;The issue of noise was reported by users. The people who used the old condoms approached the minister of health and said they made noise, &#8216;so could you make ones that make less noise?&#8217;&#8221; &#8220;So members, please help yourself to the condoms, which we expect we can all use for maximum pleasure and protection.&#8221;&nbsp; &nbsp;News24
