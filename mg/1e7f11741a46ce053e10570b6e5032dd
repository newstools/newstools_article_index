Let&#8217;s get this city working again,&#8221; said new mayor Herman Mashaba, who is&nbsp;an entrepreneur.The ANC took 45% of the vote to the DA&#8217;s 38%&nbsp;in the elections - short of an outright majority. The DA rallied smaller parties to back Mashaba, who won by 144 votes to mayor Parks Tau&#8217;s 125. The EFF became kingmakers after emerging as third in the city.The DA last week took over Tshwane and Nelson Mandela Bay, which includes manufacturing hub Port Elizabeth, also with the support of smaller parties .The DA has been running Cape Town since 2006.The ANC still won the most votes overall during the election and was working to form coalitions in the municipalities where it lost its majority.&nbsp; Reuters
