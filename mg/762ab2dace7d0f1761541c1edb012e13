Lectures at the University of Cape Town were temporarily suspended today following student protest action.Kylie Hatton, acting executive director at UCT&#8217;s communication and marketing department, said the university remained open for staff who were requested to report for duty.She said that the security situation would be assessed throughout the day.Last Thursday, a group of about 200 protesters, including UCT workers and students and students from other universities, engaged in protest action, disrupting the Jammie shuttle service operating on the lower campus and on the Sandown route.The protest was linked to a student disciplinary tribunal that started off campus last Wednesday.Three students were hauled before the tribunal for allegedly committing criminal acts, including assault, intimidation, arson and vandalism during protests earlier this year.Hatton said the UCT libraries as well as the so-called 24/7 study area will also be closed.
