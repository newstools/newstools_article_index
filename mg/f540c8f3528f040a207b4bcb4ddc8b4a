South African President Jacob Zuma made the payment ordered by the Constitutional Court for taxpayers money spent to upgrade his private home in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal province, the national treasury said. The money has been paid to the Revenue Fund, Yolisa Tyantsi, acting spokesperson for the treasury, said in an emailed response to questions on Monday, without giving more details.The treasury had recommended Zuma pay R7.81-million rand&nbsp;for non-security-related features, including a swimming pool, amphitheatre, a chicken run and cattle enclosure. The nation s top court ruled in March that Zuma had violated the Constitution by not abiding by a graft ombudsman resolution that he should pay some of the more than R200-million spent on the residence.
