EFF leader Julius Malema praised #OccupyLuthuliHouse protesters on Monday, saying they were standing up for their rights.&#8220;I celebrated their courage that, even when they saw that rented mob of so-called ANC Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA), those Nyaope delinquents who have been fed Whoonga the whole night to beat up those people here today, still the young people were courageous enough to go. I salute them,&#8221; Malema said.Malema was briefing media on the EFF&#8217;s central command&#8217;s resolutions taken over the weekend.He said the youth at the #OccupyLuthuliHouse march were a by-product of the EFF&#8217;s influence.&#8220;We are very happy we are influencing them. Remember, it&#8217;s the EFF that teaches fearlessness. We are happy that we continue to influence them, and the ANC cowards are beginning to learn a few things from the EFF.&#8221;ANC Youth League national secretary Njabulo Nzuza accused EFF chairperson Dali Mpofu of funding the protest.&#8220;If we want to march to Luthuli House, we will march. I don&#8217;t know what this young man is smoking. I have never heard of this young man before he made this statement. The ANC must stop looking for scapegoats and third forces because the problem is within the ANC. It has been rejected not by us, but by the people of South Africa,&#8221; Mpofu said.Malema said he was hoping that #OccupyLuthuliHouse would not be discouraged and, instead, attract more numbers.&#8220;If they genuinely believe in what they are doing, they will not get tired. They will be tired if they don&#8217;t believe in it,&#8221; Malema said, adding that they needed patience in order to remove President Jacob Zuma.&#8220;It will take long. It&#8217;s not an easy thing. We told you, we will remove Zuma. We try everything, every opportunity we get we try to remove him. We welcome those who are joining the struggle to remove this criminal. That&#8217;s why, when we win elections and there are hung municipalities, we try to remove Zuma from office.The #OccupyLuthuliHouse movement is demanding that Zuma and his national executive committee step down.During the protests, MKMVA members threatened protesters and journalists, while forming human chains around the ANC headquarters.
