 It started when I saw the [dancing] routines of a friend of my sister. Seeing her perform made me want to dance, because it was really beautiful and elegant &mdash; the art of pole dancing just really stuck with me. From there I started classes. Now I teach pole dancing part-time, too.I see pole dancing as more performance art than just a dance. What I like about it is that it s an empowering dance form. You can express your sexuality, your sensuality, your acrobatic flair in whichever way you choose. It s really great in building strength and building confidence.I find it does that not only for me, but for the women and men that I teach, too. They develop a sort of persona around their dancing, which allows them to be really bold and explore that alter ego. Teaching in Belville [in the Western Cape], I find that a lot of my students are quite repressed in that sense, so I think it s progressive for them.You learn to do a move you never thought you could do &mdash; and it s not just about strength and how it looks; your interpretation of each move is also really rewarding.I do hear people saying that pole dancing is too raunchy or sleazy. I have very little time for them. I try to explain that it s not just about stripping. But there s a whole part of the pole dance community that wants to separate it from its stripping roots, and I don t agree with that either because it suggests a kind of prejudice.Every month I plan to perform at Stripperoke, a Cape Town event where people sing karaoke while we dance. It s nice because you only have to take off what you feel comfortable with. I won t go down to a G-string. I have my pole shorts and a stage bra. I would probably do it professionally [but] there s always the lingering fear that your uncle will walk into the strip club. &mdash; Mia Ardene (27) as told to Rebecca Davis
