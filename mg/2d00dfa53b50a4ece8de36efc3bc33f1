On the outskirts of Somerset West, about an hour s drive out of Cape Town, the Bottega family welcomes old friends and new guests to celebrate the new Idiom restaurant and wine tasting centre nestled in the mountains at the foot of Sir Lowry s Pass. With views over the Helderberg basin and the Cape Peninsula, the dining experience at Idiom is a feast for the eyes as well as the palette. Built to celebrate a decade of wine excellence, the new restaurant brings guests into the heart of the winery, where the original tasting room has been extended to incorporate the new dining experience. Designed by architect Thomas Leach, in close partnership with the Bottega family, the restaurant fuses Old World, classically-styled Roman arches and stone porticos with a New World timber pavilion and concrete wine tasting cubeto impart a contemporary yet timeless feel , explains Leach. For the Bottega family, it was also a chance to pay homage to their Italian and South African heritage. The fusion of styles means that the building constantly surprises and looks different from every angle, says Roberto Bottega, son of Idiom s owner Alberto. The menu reflects this fusion and the restaurant s signature pairing menu features the extensive Idiom wine offering each paired with the delicious creations by chef Irwin de Vries. Two things I always order when I find them on a menu are risotto, and a panacotta for dessert because they re two dishes difficult to master in my home kitchen. I was blown away by both the risotto starter and the incredible fynbos-infused panacotta dessert, which were both prepared to perfection, pairing beautifully with the bold Idiom wine flavour profiles and plated with finesse. The Idiom Wine Tasting Centre is open from 10am to 5pm daily. The Idiom Restaurant is open from 10am to 5pm (Wednesday to Sunday).
