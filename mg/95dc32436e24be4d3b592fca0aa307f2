 My mother and grandmother were big into fashion. They were real fashion-heads. So I guess it s kind of encrypted in me. But it was in high school that I fell in love with fashion. I was in Grade 11 and wanted a look that would take me anywhere and everywhere. I was quite the athlete. I was into sport and used to play soccer, but I wanted to move away from the tracksuit-type of style. I was like: Nah man, this is not the life I want to live . I wanted to dress up every day to look good every day. I wanted something that was going to be me, but elegant at the same time. I always loved my formal pieces, but would only wear them on a Sunday or when I was going out. And when I started wearing them more, my friends would be like: Man, you re killing it. I started modeling but realised I wanted to be behind the scenes. So I started studying photography and decided to start blogging. My blog is about dapper guys from the townships where I come from guys who dress in a more gentlemanly way. No izikhothane vibes. We don t have that kind of content. You do a Google search for dapper guys in townships , and Google will probably take you to some white content. It s hard to find content about us, about our style. Now I m hoping to collaborate. Not just with people who think this is cool but with visionaries; people who want to change the game. I want to create a true insight into black creativity and black style. I want us to be wild about our culture, and really make it work for us. Siphamandla Dlamini (24) as told to Carl Collison, the Other Foundation s Rainbow fellow at the Mail &amp; Guardian
