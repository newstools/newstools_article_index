A Coffee shop at the University of KwaZulu-Natal&#8217;s Howard campus in Durban was burned down last night allegedly by protesting students. The university has been disrupted by protest action for more than two weeks following demands by the Student Representative Council for one of their members to be allowed to sit on the university&#8217;s executive management. University spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka confirmed that serious damage was caused to the coffee shop. The building from which the business operated belongs to the university. He said that he saw a Facebook post which stated that the shop was burnt because those running it failed to close despite being ordered to shut down. &#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s related to the protest action,&#8221; he said.#UKZN Howard College Campus upper cafe is on fire. pic.twitter.com/IDdzcSC2jL&mdash; MiCampus Magazine (@MiCampusMag) August 29, 2016
