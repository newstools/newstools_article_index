The University of Cape Town has suspended this afternoon&#8217;s classes and lectures following protest action.In a short statement it said that the temporary suspension was introduced &#8220;to assess the situation and implement additional security measures on campus&#8221;.According to the university, lectures and classes will resume on Monday morning.On Thursday, a group of about 200 protesters, including UCT workers and students and students from other universities, engaged in protest action, disrupting the Jammie shuttle service operating on the lower campus and on the Sandown route.Kylie Hatton, the acting executive director at UCT&#8217;s communication and marketing department, said in a statement that the protest was connected to a student disciplinary tribunal that started off campus yesterday.&#8220;It is important to stress that UCT has only instituted action against a very small number of students who are alleged to have committed criminal acts, including assault, intimidation, arson and vandalism during the protests earlier this year.&#8221;She said that yesterday&#8217;s disciplinary process involved three students.Hatton said that earlier this year a student disciplinary tribunal resulted in two students being expelled after a plea-bargaining process in which they admitted guilt.&#8220;They are appealing the sanction and so the final outcome is not yet determined.&#8221;She said that the university had obtained an interdict against three students, two of whom were involved in yesterday&#8217;s disciplinary tribunal.She said&nbsp;that the interdict was subject to an appeal to be heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal on September 29.&#8220;The university encourages all on campus to behave with respect for the rights of others, including those of staff members and students who choose not to take part in protest action,&#8221; she said.
