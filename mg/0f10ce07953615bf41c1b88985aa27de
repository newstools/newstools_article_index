Rap duo&nbsp;Die Antwoord found themselves in the middle of a Twitter storm on Wednesday&nbsp;after band member Yolandi Visser said&nbsp;Suicide Squad director David Ayer copied their style. Users of the social media platform soon responded to Visser&#8217;s rant, saying the duo found their success in the music industry through&nbsp;cultural appropriation and are in no position to call anyone out.&nbsp; Dear . @DieAntwoord These guys are waiting on their royalties pic.twitter.com/lAZTnjJUhH &mdash; CapeTown, Bru.

Criticism of their $O$ album even resulted in group&nbsp;leaking former editor Chris Roper&#8217;s number on one of their music videos. He wrote at the time:The video in question is Fok julle Naaiers, from 2012 s Ten$ion, and features Waddy, Yo-Landi and a misshapen DJ Hi-Tek (who appears to have had botox to make himself look like an attack poodle), threatening to fok a punk ass white boy in the ass . Waddy does his usual aggressive look (in the film Zoolander, it would probably be called something like Constipated Ninja ), regurgitates worms and spiders, and waves a couple of guns around. Dj Hi-Tek raps in front of a wall, on which is scrawled the number of the feared 28s gang of the Western Cape, a drawing of a dude with an unnaturally large penis, Viva ANC , moffie , and my mobile number with the invitation 4 Hot Bum Sex Call .See the rest of the the M&amp;G s Die Antwoord package: Are Die Antwoord blackface?
