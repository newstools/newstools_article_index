A &#8220;ring of fire&#8221; eclipse is making an appearance in the skies above much of Africa today as the moon passes between the earth and the sun. This phenomenon, also known as an&nbsp;annular eclipse, occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun but is at too great a distance&nbsp;from the earth to cover the sun completely.&nbsp;People from across Africa took to social media to share their pictures and videos of the eclipse.&nbsp;From Ile-Ife, Osun state #solareclipse pic.twitter.com/1sHG0GOTMJ&mdash; #teamOAU (@OAU_gossipz) September 1, 2016The Annular solar eclipse in the southern highlands of Tanzania - Rujewa, Mbarali in Mbeya #solareclipse #JFLeo pic.twitter.com/xGRBv6bMbm&mdash; Jamii Forums (@JamiiForums) September 1, 2016Our view of the #solareclipse here @ Kinshasa D.R.C pic.twitter.com/3CYNt3AMFx&mdash; Christian S.
