The state s economic cluster is preparing to implement 40 high-impact investment projects, 10 of which will be fast-tracked.They are linked to a nine-point plan to re-energise the economy, which was announced in the president s State of the Nation address in February and includes encouraging private sector investment, moderating workplace conflict and revitalising agriculture and agro-processing.The top projects under consideration for implementation in the next two years include introducing an AB InBev agricultural project for barley and hops and building the agro-supply chain in four provinces, establishing a Clover industrial park to grow the dairy industry and value chain, establishing a development zone for abalone farming, and developing a Transnet offshore supply base. This is certainly one of the areas that the fin min [finance minister] is going to be punting to investors and rating agencies in the coming weeks, said Jeffrey Schultz, an economist at BNP Paribas Securities South Africa.&nbsp; As we know, rating agencies in particular want to see tangible evidence of structural reforms being implemented. &nbsp;
