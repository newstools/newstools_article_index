ANC members are expected to participate in the #OccupyLuthuliHouse campaign on Monday, which is calling for the resignation of both ANC president Jacob Zuma and his national executive committee (NEC).Ordinary members have vowed to occupy the party&#8217;s headquarters in Johannesburg, despite acts of intimidation by ANC Youth League leaders in the capital city on Friday.On Friday, Tshwane Youth League chairperson Lesego Makhubela, his deputy Ezra Letsoalo and regional secretary Ratshi Mashamba stormed the occupy movement briefing, claiming supporters of the movement had no permission to speak under the banner of the ANC.They also lashed out at former National Press Club chair Jose Charle, who they claimed was anti-revolutionary for assisting people who did not belong to their movement to bring the ANC to its knees.The Gauteng ANC&#8217;s provincial executive committee is also discouraging its members from participating in the movement on Monday.The PEC instead called on its members to wait for a possible &#8220;special national consultative conference&#8221;.Provincial secretary Hope Papo said in a statement that the PEC believed the challenges facing the ANC could only be resolved through proper and structured organisational processes.He said party members should &#8220;remain disciplined&#8221;.Meanwhile, a letter purportedly written by the secretary general s office of the ANC to managers and Luthuli House staff has been making the rounds on social media.The letter has requested for staff members to report for duty as normal.&#8220;We also request that no meetings be called for Monday with any outside person or groups. Staff members coming in on Monday are required to be at work on Monday before 8am. Please note that no visitor shall be allowed into the building on Monday,&#8221; read the letter.News24 could not verify if the letter was legitimate.One of the organisers, Bonolo Ramokhele, has said the idea is to have a demonstration at the party&#8217;s head offices, when the president is expected to attend a National Working Committee meeting. We wish to reassure millions of South Africans that as bleak as the situation might be, there are ANC members who are decisively ready to change this trajectory. We refuse to stand silently in our corners and watch this erosion unfold, we refuse to be intimidated and if need be will die to save the ANC. The ANC is losing power, its losing society. We therefore call upon members of society, members of the ANC and non-members to please come and join us [On Monday] so that we correct these wrongs. &nbsp; News24
