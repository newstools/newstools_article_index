Her birthday is on September 26, but a simple date can t stop Winnie Madikizela Mandela from celebrating her day whenever she pleases. The South African icon had an early celebration at the swanky Mount Nelson hotel in Cape Town and, even though she s always beaten the odds, South Africans were surprised by one thing: mam Winnie s ability to overthrow even the effects of aging.On Wednesday night, when the Mother of the Nation arrived at her birthday dinner, South Africans collectively inhaled at a woman who is turning 80. Does being a fearless woman leader mean you can put a stop to the impact time and sip from the fountain of youth?Can mama #WinnieMandela share her secret. We all wanna age like her, she&#8217;s a beautiful 80 year old. #winnie80th pic.twitter.com/WOXHNwP2ju&mdash; Womandla (@FifiMokoena1) September 15, 2016 The mother of the Nation never looked more Flawlessly breathtaking. #WinnieMandela #Mbokodo pic.twitter.com/lVZ34z73Kk&mdash; Bra Nape (@simplynape) September 15, 2016 The most beautiful 80 year old ever!!!!!
