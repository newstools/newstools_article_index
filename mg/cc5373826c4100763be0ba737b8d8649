The national treasury said Eskom wrongly stated that coal supply contracts between itself and Tegeta Exploration and Resources had been audited by the finance ministry and has ignored queries regarding the company.Tegeta is part owned by the Gupta family, who are friends with President Jacob Zuma and are&nbsp;in business with his son. Treasury is reviewing Eskom s coal contracts. To date, not only has Eskom failed to honour its undertaking to submit comments to treasury s report but it has chosen to ignore correspondence and put all forms of hindrances, treasury said in a statement on Twitter.&nbsp; It is treasury s view that a company or entity that is doing business with government and has nothing to hide should be transparent and should welcome reviews of its dealings with the state. - Bloomberg
