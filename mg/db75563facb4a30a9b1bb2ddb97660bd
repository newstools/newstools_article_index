The Mail &amp; Guardian apologises unreservedly to Makhensa Mabunda and to Siyaya Consulting Engineers for not referring to the former s explanation regarding the use of the DBI s logo, as well as their denial of the allegation that they had unlawfully benefited from Prasa contracts.The article, headlined Prasa accuses SA partner of fraud (June 24) was about the DBI that reportedly wanted to have Siyaya Consulting Engineers liquidated. Claims were made in the story, including that Siyaya had made unauthorised use of the DBI logo.We also: erroneously stated as fact the allegations that DBI had&nbsp;exposed Siyaya s hijacking of its official logo, falsely implying a partnership between them in order to dupe the parastatal into concluding various deals with the company; and did not ask Mabunda for his comment about the allega- tion that he had allegedly posi- tioned himself to score from Prasa deals as far back&nbsp;as 2008 .We apologise for this as well, cognisant of the fact that we have not properly exercised care and consideration regarding their dignity and reputation.This matter was referred to the press ombudsman by Mabunda and Siyaya.
