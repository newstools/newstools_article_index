&#8220;Kill the gays&#8221; pastor Steven Anderson has been deported from Botswana, the country s government announced on its Twitter account today. The decision to deport Anderson follows a claim of assault, protests outside his church and an interview on Radio Gabs in which he reiterated his belief that governments should kill homosexuals and his support for slavery.Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana&mdash; Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016 Known for being virulently and unapologetically homophobic,&nbsp;Anderson was prohibited by the South African government from entering the country by the department of home affairs, after LGBTI rights activists across the country collected more than 60 000 signatures from people opposing Anderson s visit to the country. Although LGBTI and human rights organisations in Botswana had mobilised to have Anderson barred from visiting the country, the &#8220;pastor of hate&#8221; and his followers were ultimately allowed entry. According to the website www.mambaonline, Anderson had also attacked 59-year-old Tony Benn after Benn questioned Anderson on his views. Admitting to this in a video posted to his YouTube account, Anderson referred to Benn as an old homo . Benn, who identifies as heterosexual, says he would be laying a charge of assault against Anderson. Welcoming the Botswana government s decision, Hendrik Baird, who spearheaded the South African lobby against Anderson, said: We are ecstatic about this. Africa has now stood up for what s right. We should always be vigilant of these new colonialists coming to Africa and telling us how to run our lives. &nbsp;
