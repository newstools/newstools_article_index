Parliament&#8217;s ad hoc committee tasked with finding a new Public Protector is expected to decide on a candidate to replace Thuli Madonsela.Last week, the committee whittled the 14 remaining candidates down to five. In a relatively short meeting, MPs called for certain candidates to fall .Candidates including Madonsela s current deputy Kevin Malunga and former NPA asset forfeiture unit head Willie Hofmeyr did not make the cut.The five candidates are judges Siraj Desai and Sharise Weiner, advocates Busisiwe Mkhwebane, Muvhango Lukhaimane, and Professor Bongani Majola.Whoever receives the most support will be tabled for endorsement in the National Assembly by August 31.Madonsela s seven-year term ends in mid-October. &nbsp;News24
