The results of a groundbreaking survey looking into South Africans&#8217; attitudes toward homosexuality and gender nonconformity will be released on Friday.Produced by the Other Foundation and the Human Sciences Research Council, the survey saw more than 3 000 South Africans in various regions being interviewed in their choice of eight of South Africa s most widely spoken languages.&nbsp; The Other Foundation s Neville Gabriel said: There is a general perception that African society is homophobic, but the truth is we don t know this for sure as proper research into this has not been conducted. The survey was undertaken to see what the South African population really thinks and to be able to engage with society in a meaningful way around these issues, he said, adding: And what the results are showing us is significantly different from what we might usually hear. Commenting on the report s findings, Professor Crain Soudien, CEO of the HSRC, said: The results convey the considerable effort still required to ensure that society understands and respects the rights of LGBTI people in the country. Such knowledge serves as an important basis for further promoting social justice by enriching and shaping social dialogue, advocacy, and policy interventions. Read more on the report s findings in this week s edition of Mail &amp; Guardian. The Other Foundation is looking to support interested researchers to work with activists and advocates to deepen this knowledge and analysis further.
