THE University of Cape Town (UCT) is monitoring a small protest that disrupted the operation of its Jammie bus service on its lower campus.UCT said that its bus service has been diverted to an alternative route.It said that classes and lectures were continuing on all its campuses.UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola said the university was still trying to ascertain what issues triggered the protest action.&#8220;The UCT executive has not yet had any formal notification from the protesting group over what the issues are.&#8221;He said, however, it appeared that the protest action was in solidarity with three students whose cases are being heard by the UCT Student Disciplinary Tribunal this morning.&#8220;The cases relate to the students&#8217; alleged involvement in unlawful activities during the Shackville protest in February which included acts of violence, vandalism and arson. UCT supports legitimate protest action that is peaceful and non-violent,&#8221; he said.
