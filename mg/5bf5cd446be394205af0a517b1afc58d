Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has told delegates of the National Council of Provinces that the government has not entered into a nuclear deal with any country.Ramaphosa appeared before the NCOP to answer questions on Wednesday, and said the nuclear programme would be based on affordability and sustainability.&#8220;Government has not entered into a nuclear deal with any country,&#8221; he said in answer to a question from DA MP Willem Faber.&#8220;We are open to a fair and transparent procurement process, and at a scale and pace that our country can afford.&#8221;A request for a nuclear programme that will release 9 600MW will be made to the market during this financial year, he continued.&#8220;Any decision will only take place after the request for proposal process has been completed, and a final funding model has been developed.&#8221;He also said the government had always aimed to have an energy plan that contained an appropriate energy mix, including fossil fuels, coal and hydro.&#8220;In pursuing a suitable nuclear plan, our generators&#8217; capacities should be evidence-based, sustainable and affordable,&#8221; he added.In a supplementary question, Faber asked Ramaphosa about government&#8217;s &#8220;failure&#8221; to provide 10 documents on the proposed nuclear deal to the Southern African Faith Communities&#8217; Environment Institute and Earthlife Africa Johannesburg.Ramaphosa said that case was currently being heard in the Western Cape High Court, and it would therefore be inappropriate for him to comment on the requested documents.
