North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo must, by next week, commit to making a decision on the chieftainship of Bakwena Baphalane ba Ramokoka or face the consequences.A lawyer for one of the three men claiming the title of kgosi told Mahumapelo this week that should he not do so, he will face a punitive cost order against you, as the premier .Mahumapelo has been sitting on a report into the leadership dispute since last year, a lawyer for Bosman Ramokoka said in a letter of demand, disrespecting and ignoring the rights of the Ramokokastad residents.Both Bosman Ramokoka and George Ramokoka Mokoka are laying claim to the chieftainship of the people currently ruled by James Ramokoka. George is claiming it on behalf of his cousin, Nathaniel.Various supporters have blamed clashes between them on the ongoing uncertainty about future leadership of the community, which controls land rich in platinum and other minerals, and claims considerable royalties and rental income.There are also swirling mutual accusations of back-hand deals with mining companies, embezzled rental payments for farms, and salaried government posts doled out as favours.The dispute was investigated in early 2013. By November 2014 a report had been sent to Mahumapelo, Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen told the Bosman group in a recent exchange of letters.And the premier was supposed to make a decision within 60 days, the minister said.Mahumapelo s office could not this week definitively say whether he had received the letter of demand from the Bosman group. He was not available to answer questions.The disputing parties have claimed instances of fraud by one another, and at least one has demanded DNA tests to settle genealogy &mdash; with the suggestion that ancestors may have to be exhumed. We need to settle this thing now, or people are going to get badly hurt, said a representative for one of the groups. He insisted this was a warning, not a threat.
