The University of Johannesburg is to consider written representations from 17 suspended students seeking permission to&nbsp;be granted limited access to the campus to continue with their studies.The students were suspended last week for their alleged involvement in the burning of its auditorium in May that resulted in damage estimated at about R100-million.The university said in a statement that the students would be required to provide it with &#8220;all the facts and information&#8221; relevant to amending the terms and conditions of their suspensions, including their academic schedules and timetables. &#8220;The university retains the right to terminate such conditional limited access or amend the conditions at any time it considers it to be necessary. The university is nevertheless mindful of its responsibility not to prejudice the state s criminal case and hence it will not be prudent to make detailed information about the evidence in its possession public.&#8221;The university said that claims about fee increases for next year were aimed at provoking their students.&#8220;The fact is that fees for 2017 are still under discussion as are measures to secure the sustainability of universities, and measures to achieve expanded funded access.&#8221;It said UJ had a proud track record of expanding access for poor, working-class and lower-middle-class students.&#8220;This is evidenced by the university&#8217;s many efforts including thus far raising R70-million towards funding the access of students from the &#8216;missing middle&#8217;.&#8221;
