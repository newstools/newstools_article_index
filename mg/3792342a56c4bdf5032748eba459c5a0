EFF leader Julius Malema has promised Marikana residents that the ANC will never govern Rustenburg again.Speaking at&nbsp;The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union&#8217;s&nbsp;(Amcu)&nbsp;commemoration of the Marikana massacre on Tuesday, Malema said Jesus had not only landed in Port Elizabeth, but he had landed in Rustenburg as well.&#8220;I hear people who say Jesus landed in Port Elizabeth. He has not landed there only. He has also arrived in Rustenburg.&#8221;Introducing the new EFF councillor in Marikana, Malema said the party was taking out the ANC &#8220;piece by piece&#8221;.&#8220;We are eating this elephant called the ANC, piece by piece. We are going to make sure that the ANC will never run this municipality.&#8221;Malema made several promises, saying the EFF would provide jobs and good service delivery.He then took a jab at DA leader Mmusi Maimane who was also present at the commemoration, saying the EFF was not in Marikana because it was &#8220;fashionable&#8221;.&#8220;When you are here, you are at the home of the&nbsp;EFF. We do not relate with you today because it&#8217;s fashionable to do so. We are here to say thank you for voting for the EFF.&#8221;Maimane said until President Jacob Zuma personally came to the area to apologise, there would be no freedom in the country.He said the DA was working in Parliament to provide compensation for Marikana victims and their families.Amcu is commemorating the Marikana massacre in the North West.On August 16 2012, police shot and killed 34 miners, apparently while trying to disperse them and end a strike.10 people, including two police officers and two Lonmin security guards, were killed in the preceding week.The Farlam Commission of Inquiry was instituted to investigate the incident and the circumstances around it.It recommended that there be a probe into suspended National police commissioner Riah Phiyega&#8217;s fitness to hold office.&nbsp; News24
