The Play List Msaki &mdash; Dance Zaneliza: How the Water Moves: I finally got a copy of an album that has been receiving a lot of radio love, even without uncle Hlaudi s 90% quota. Msaki has an incomparable voice that remarkably locks notes with every instrument in her expansive sonic ensemble and firmly roots her songs as small stories. (MB)Stay Inside with Earl Sweatshirt and Knxwledge: A friend recently sent me a YouTube link to episode three of this radio programme, recorded for Red Bull Music Academy Radio. I have no idea what happens with episodes one, two or four, but there is a stoned charm to their anti-DJing style as the two bumble through what seems to be crate upon crate of a deep and diverse vinyl collection. (KS)The Reading List CCTV: A zine for local ideas in global practice. A colleague and I were discussing zine-making as a very necessary practice when it comes to spreading and rapidly historicising moments and particular ideas. When she asked me how to make them, I couldn t think of a better example of this underrated alternative form of self-publishing than Keleketla! Library s CCTV volume one. This short publication surveys the contribution of cultural practitioners (writers, musicians, artists and DJs) who have carved the fingers, arms and legs of the body of contemporary South African culture. It profiles the work of contributors including Lerato Bereng, Molemo Moiloa, Kemang wa Lehulere, Thenjiwe Nkosi, Kim Gurney and Cuss. Visit cctvzine.tumblr.com/ (MB)The Street: Paul McNally s book is about Ontdekkers Road and the web of drug dealing and bribe-taking he describes as going down at the Sophiatown police station and its surrounding neighbourhoods. McNally s plain prose needs little embellishment, for the truth is stranger than fiction in grimy western Johannesburg. (KS)
