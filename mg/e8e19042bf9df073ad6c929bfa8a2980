There once was a West African queen named Pokou, or Abla Pokou, who, in the mid-18th century, ruled what is today known as C te d Ivoire.Queen Pokou (c 1730 to 1750) was born a Kumasi princess in Ghana and was the niece of Osei Kofu Tutu I, a prominent king and cofounder of the Ashanti Empire.&nbsp; Following a series of violent disagreements with the Ashanti confederacy of the time, the young woman led a breakaway group on an arduous journey westwards to the Komoe River, where they became stuck with no way to cross. At the river s edge, she asked her priest for advice on how to cross the river safely and he told her that she would have to sacrifice her son.&nbsp; She dressed her infant son in regal golden clothing and placed him in the water and called out, Ba ouli , which means the child is dead . After the sacrifice, some hippopotami emerged and formed a bridge. After crossing the river safely, Pokou and her people settled into the territory between the Komoe and Bandama rivers. Her descendants are the Baoul tribe, the largest in today s C te d Ivoire, having assimilated smaller tribes over time.Last weekend, Ivorian designer Loza Mal ombho released images of her latest collection on Instagram.
