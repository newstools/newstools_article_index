Growth in 11 African economies accounting for 60 per cent of the continent s GDP has slowed sharply, a new McKinsey Global Institute report says. The countries comprise the continent s oil exporters and the three countries involved in the Arab Spring Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. But the economies generating the other 40 per cent of Africa s GDP increased their annual growth rate from 4.1 per cent between 2000 and 2010 to 4.4 per cent in 2010-2015. However, the report says that the overall outlook is positive, with the International Monetary Fund projecting that Africa will be the world s second fastest-growing region in the period to 2020. The report, Lions on the Move II: Realising the Potential of Africa s Economies, shows that between 2010 and 2015, GDP growth averaged just 3.3 per cent, remarkably weaker than the 4.9 per cent a year between 2000 and 2008. Despite recent shocks and challenges, spending by Africa s consumers and businesses totals $4 trillion annually, and is growing rapidly. Household consumption is expected to grow at 3.8 per cent a year to total $2.1 trillion by 2025. African businesses are an even larger spender. From $2.6 trillion in 2015, business spending is expected to increase to $3.5 trillion by 2025, the report says. Acha Leke, a McKinsey senior partner and report co-author, said: Our new research shows how in coming years Africa will benefit from strong fundamentals including a young and growing population, the world s fastest urbanisation rate, and accelerating technological change. These will help drive rapid growth in consumer markets and business supply chains, and will offer opportunities to build large, profitable industrial and services companies. Africa has 700 companies with revenues of more than $500 million, of which 400 have revenue of more than $1 billion. Africa s large companies are reportedly growing faster and are generally more profitable than global peers. The continent s top 100 companies have achieved success by developing strong positions at home, staying the course to build their businesses over decades, integrating what other companies would usually outsource, and investing in building and retaining talent. Further success is possible in six high-potential sectors with high growth, high profitability, and low consolidation: Wholesale and retail, food and agri-processing, health care, financial services, light manufacturing, and construction, the research authors suggest.
