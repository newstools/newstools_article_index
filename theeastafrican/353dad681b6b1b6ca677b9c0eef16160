The carrier, which increased its fleet with two additional planes during the year, operates flights between Mombasa, Eldoret, Nairobi and Mombasa. The airline increased its staff complement to 35 from 29 at a time its parent company is downsizing as it grapples with multibillion-shilling financial hemorrhage that has triggered a restructuring plan. JamboJet debts stood at $11 million as captured under current liabilities, which was a drop from $12 million. KQ management disclosed it had applied for extension of use of JamboJet tax losses incurred in the period 2009-2010 to offset future taxable profits. JamboJet tax losses were said to be $8.56 million. The airline has, however, been operational for two years in which it booked accumulated losses of $4.05 million. In 2014 it wrote a loss of $1.18 million associated with setup costs which was followed by a $2.87 million loss last year. JamboJet was yet to respond to queries on the tax losses at the time of publishing.
