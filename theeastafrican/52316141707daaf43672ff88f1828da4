Gabon's opposition leader, Jean Ping, has lodged an appeal with the constitutional court against what he says were rigged elections last month. President Ali Bongo won by a margin of fewer than 6,000 votes. Mr Ping has been particularly critical of the results from Mr Bongo's stronghold, where he won over 95% of the vote with turnout at 99.93%. European Union election observers have also criticised the results in the province, citing "clear anomalies". There has been violent unrest since the results were announced last week.
