He was driven towards the border with Mali, the mayor of the town of Abalak, Ahmed Dilo, told Reuters news agency.Gunmen arrived on a motorbike and then an all-terrain vehicle, first killing the guards and then taking the aid worker away in the car, he said.Niger has been less prone to kidnappings than Mali, where militant groups are more active.A French-led military operation banished Islamist fighters from towns in northern Mali in 2013, but militant groups still roam the extensive desert region.
