Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, who marks one year in office on 29 May, has battled endemic corruption in government, an insurgency in the north by militant Islamists, a resumption of conflict in the oil-rich south and a worsening economic situation. Here are five quotes in which he outlined his leadership style, and how he intended to tackle the problems in Africa's most populous state and biggest economy: &#34;I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody&#34;&#34;I cannot change the past. But I can change the present and the future. I am a former military ruler and a converted democract&#34; If Boko Haram continues with suicide bombings, we might consider banning wearing the hijab We cannot build an economy where corruption is the working capital&#34;&#34;I am not going to demand any apology... What I am demanding is the return of assets&#34;
